我相信Desmond中枪
And I believe it's my son's fault

00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:35,041

39
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,033
回来干嘛  Dan
the hell are you doing back,Dan?

40
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:21,048
我以为你去安阿伯发大财了
Once you left for ann arbor, I figured you'd gotten rich,

41
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,068
发明DVD什么的

42
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,084
这就是我为什么要回来
This is what I'm doing back here.

00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,032
-他们什么时候来的
- When did they get here?

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,096
不久前
A few days ago.

45
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,015
真奇怪  对吧
It's weird, huh?

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,052
没时间了  我要你
We don't have time. I need you

47
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:34,082
马上带我去Jack哪里  好吗
To take me to Jack's right now, okay?

48
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,004
-Jack  你怎么回的  -Farady  你
- Jack. how did you get back here? - Faraday? what the--

49
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,099
你怎么做到的
How did you do it?

50
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,033
-你怎么回到岛上的  -你去哪里了
- How did you get back to the island? - where have you been?

51
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,023
我去达摩总部做研究  在安阿伯
I was--I was just at Dharma headquarters  in ann arbor. I was doing some research.

52
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,090
现在更加重要的是
What's more important right now...

53
00:02:55,093 --> 00:03:01,013
-你怎么回到1977年的  -怎么回事
- How did you get back here to 1977? - what's going on?

54
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,054
-别看我  我只帮他提箱子  -Jack  怎样来的
- Don't look at me. I just carried his luggage. - Jack, how?

55
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:08,008
嗯...我们坐飞机  然后...
Uh... we were on a plane, and then there was--

56
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,075
谁告诉你坐飞机的
Who told you to get on a plane?

57
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,016
事实上  Dan  是你的母亲
As a matter of fact, Dan, it was your mother.

58
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,064
那么她是怎样说服你的  Jack
And how did she convince you, Jack?

59
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:21,095
她告诉你这是你的宿命吗
Did she tell you it was your destiny?

60
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:24,081
对  她就这么说的
Yeah. That's exactly what she said.

61
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:27,062
我得告诉你点坏消息  Jack
Well, I got some bad news for you, Jack.

62
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:30,016
你根本就不属于这里
You don't belong here at all.

63
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,097
她错了
She was wrong.

64
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:24,031
怎么了  妈妈  你不喜欢吗
What's wrong, mom? Didn't you like it?

65
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,065
我喜欢得不行
I loved it.

66
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,077
太美妙了  Daniel
It was beautiful, Daniel.

67
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,076
Daniel
Daniel...

68
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,061
你知道命运是什么吗
Do you know what destiny means?

69
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,058
不知道
No.

70
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,029
命运就是
Destiny means that,

71
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:51,038
如果你有天赋
If one has a special gift,

72
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,096
那么你一定得去发挥它
Then it must be nurtured.

73
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,065
从你开始弹奏
How many beats has that metronome counted

74
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,070
一共有多少拍
Since you started playing?

75
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,017
864拍
864.

76
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:09,050
Daniel  你的天赋是  头脑
Your gift, daniel, is your mind--

77
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:13,043
一颗为科学和数学而生的头脑
A mind that is meant for science, mathematics.

78
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:18,001
而我的任务是
And it's my... job

79
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:21,098
确保你那样发展下去
To keep you on your path.

80
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,052
那么  不幸地是
So... unfortunately,

81
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:29,080
我不能给你太多的时间  让你分心
There's no more time... for distractions.

82
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:32,006
但是我想一直弹钢琴
But I want to keep playing the piano.

83
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,042
我可以两样兼顾
I can do both.

84
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:38,053
我能挤时间
I can make time.

85
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:42,066
那就等你能挤出时间再说
If only you could.

86
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,063
Miles  我要你带我去兰花站
Miles, I need you to bring me to the orchid.

87

89
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,062
来吧  我们出发
Come on. let's go.

90
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,063
Faraday  等等
Faraday! Wait up!

91
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,082
Miles  快点  Jack  我们马上回来
Miles, come on. Jack, we'll be right back.

92
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,095
你说你妈妈错了是什么意思  Daniel
Hey, what did you mean, you mother was wrong? daniel!

93
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:06,053
我去办点事  马上回来
I just--I just have an errand to run. Be right back!

94
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:16,046
-怎么  -Faraday回来了
- Yeah? - Faraday's back.

95
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,090
这话什么意思  为什么回来
What do you mean Faraday's back? Why?

96
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,040
我也不知道  他坐潜艇来  把我叫醒
I have no idea. He came in on the sub, and he woke me up.

97
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,049
就神神叨叨
He--he started talking nonsense,

98
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,057
然后就出发去兰花站了
And then he took off for the orchid.

99
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,033
很喜欢听你这套  但我现在有点忙
I'd love to trade theories about this,I'm little busy right now.

100
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:32,001
清晨6点  你忙什么
What are you busy in the 6 morning?

101
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,089
James  告诉他吧
James, tell him.

102
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,070
进来吧
Get in here.

103
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,064
Phil 我的一个保安手下
Phil-- one of my security guys--

104
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,024
发现一盒有我和Kate的录像带
Got himself a videotape of me and kate

105
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,075
带着那小孩去找那帮敌人
Taking the kid out to the hostiles.

106
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,060
-录像带呢  -Phil那里
- And where's the tape? - With phil.

107
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,065
Phil呢?
And where is phil?

108
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,059
Phil 这是Jack  Jack 这是Phil
Phil, jack. jack... phil.

109
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,072
我们是..
Are we...

110
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:16,054
在等什么吗
Waiting for something?

111
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:22,034
时间刚刚好
Right on time.

112
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,087
我10分钟后回来
I'll be back in ten minutes.

113
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:50,085
那你要我做什么
So what do you want me to do?

114
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,001
你什么都不用做
You're gonna do nothing.

115
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,015
如果你再钻深一厘米
If you drill even 1 centimeter further,

116
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,075
你将有可能释放那个能量
You risk releasing that energy.

117
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,084
如果这事发生了的话
If that were to happen...

118
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,061
那么就让上帝保佑我们吧
Then god help us all.

119
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:04,023
你在这里要带安全帽
Hey! you need a hard hat down here.

120
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,095
走路带眼
Watch yourself!

121
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:16,087
对不起 不会再这样了
Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.

122
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,068
我来拿一些东西  我们走
I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.

123
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,035
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

124
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:34,020
时空旅行  那人以为我们有多蠢
Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?

125
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,082
陈博士
Dr. Chang?

126
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,055
陈博士
Dr. Chang?

127
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,093
-有空吗  -看来有
- Do you have a second, sir? - I suppose.

128
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,013
我刚和潜艇上的天鹅队
I just came in on the sub with the swan team.

129
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,020
其实我们三年前见过  我是Daniel Faraday
We actually met three years ago, I'm Daniel Faraday.

130
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,088
你和Lafleur一起来的  我记得
Yes. yes. uh, you arrived with Lafleur. I remember. right.

131
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,033
我能帮你什么忙
What can I do for you?

132
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,090
我需要你下命令
I need you to order the evacuation

133
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,033
让岛上所有男女老少撤离这座岛
Of every man, woman and child on this island.

134
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,042
我凭什么这么做呢
And why would I do that?

135
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:02,050
因为担架上的那个人
Because that man is on a stretcher

136
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:05,065
就是你们在这里钻着泄露出来
As a consequence of the electromagnetic activity

137
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,098
电磁效应的后果
That your drilling unleashed down here.

138
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,009
而且这里充满了
Which is now contained.

139
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,062
这里充满了
It's contained down here.

140
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,054
但大约6小时后
But in about six hours,

141
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,030
同样的事情会在
The same thing is gonna happen

142
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:23,017
天鹅站的地方发生
At the site for the swan station,

143
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:27,067
不同的是那个能量 大约是刚才的3万倍
Only the energy there is about 30,000 times more powerful sir.

144
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,000
而那事故
And the accident...

145
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,016
会是场大灾难
It's gonna be catastrophic.

146
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,066
这绝对是无稽之谈
That is utterly absurd.

147
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:39,080
你凭什么做出这样的预测呢
What could possibly qualify you to make that kind of prediction?

148
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:44,083
我来自未来
I'm from the future.

149
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,030
等等  陈博士
Dr. Chang, wait!

150
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,028
能等一会吗  就一会
Will you wait one second, please? Wait one--one second.

151
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,098
好的  你来自未来
Yes, yes, you come from the future.

152
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,098
你听到我谈论时空旅行

他们都死了

303

311
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:47,039
因为到了明天  你就不记得我说过
Because come tomorrow, you won't remember I did.

你为什么为我这么做呢

Sawyer  他说他能带我们回到属于我们的世界

453
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,068
是的  Daniel
Yes, Daniel.

454
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:50,017
会的

455
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:01,065
好的  我去
Then I'll do it.

456
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:22,028
-你还记得密码吗  -记得
- You remember the code? - Yeah, I got it.

457
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,008
好的  让我看看
All right, I'm gonna take a look at that.

458
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,022
好的
Yeah, good.

459
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,079
只是擦伤
It's just a graze. Whew.

460
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
会有点刺痛
This is gonna sting.

461
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,061
好的
Yeah.

462
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:39,034
好的  很快就好了
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

463
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:41,046
我可真幸运
I guess I'm lucky.

464
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,067
这跟幸运有什么关系
What's luck have to do with it?

465
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,085
你不是说该发生的事  肯定会发生的吗
I thought you said whatever happened, happened.

466
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,024
你会明白的  Jack
You gotta understand, Jack,

467
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,070
这是我们的现在
This is our present.

468
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,026
我们见面时  我的脖子上有疤吗
When we met, did I have a scar on my neck?

469
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:54,073
没有
No.

470
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,006
那是因为我还没有被枪击
'cause I hadn't been shot yet.

471
00:30:57,096 --> 00:31:00,080
我们不能天真的认为我们不会出事
We can't be so naive as to think nothing can happen to us.

472
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,005
我们中的任何人都会死  Jack
Any one of us can die, Jack.

473
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,015
好的
Okay.

474
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:09,026
已经关了
It's off.

475
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:12,029
谢谢
Thanks.

476
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,039
哪条路
Which way?

477
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,058
往里走2英里
Just a couple miles in.

478
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,061
你觉得他知道自己在做什么吗
Do you think he knows what he's doing?

479
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:31,081
希望如此
I sure hope so.

480
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:34,089
已经回不了头了
There's no turning back now.

481
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:44,039
你刚刚给那些蠢货打电话让他们来着
You called it the minute those yahoos got here.

482
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:46,012
你该告诉我的
I shoulda listened to you.

483
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,096
你可以说  那我也告诉你
You can say, "I told you so."

484
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,074
等我们到了岸上吧
Maybe after we get to the beach.

485
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,033
你还支持我吗
You still got my back?

486
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,010
你呢
You still got mine?

487
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:16,017
这下糟了
That's not good, right?

488
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,032
Lafleur
Lafleur!

489
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,090
你去哪了  
Where have you been? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

490
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,059
别紧张  发生什么事了
Take it easy, stu. What the hell's going on?

491
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,057
我被一个物理学家打了一枪
I just got shot by a physicist,

492
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:34,060
还有新兵在帮他
And the new recruits are helping him.

493
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,035
我们中有奸细
We've been infiltrated.

494
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:39,019
太荒唐了  冷静些
That's ridiculous. Now just calm down for a minute.

495
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,029
我们谈谈
We can talk about this.

496
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:43,058
那是什么
What was that?

497
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,067
好像是从外面传过来的
It sounded like it was from outside.

498
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,095
趴在地上
Get down on the ground now.

499
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,043
马上
I said now!

500
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,026
谢谢
Thank you.

501
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,086
你需要拿着枪跟你妈妈说话吗  Dan
You need a gun to go talk to your mother, Dan?

502
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,081
你不了解我妈妈  Jack
You don't know my mother, Jack.

503
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,049
准备告诉我们为什么她是错的了吗
You ready to tell me why she was wrong?

504
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:47,043
为什么我们不属于这里
Why we don't belong here?

505
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,059
四个小时之内
In about four hours,

506
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:02,056
天鹅工作区的达摩组织的人
The dharma folks at the swan work site--

507
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:05,034
他们将会钻到地下
They're gonna--gonna drill into the ground

508
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:08,002
并且会意外碰到巨大能量袋
And accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.

509
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,086
这个能量的释放
The result of the release of this energy

510
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,023
会造成一场灾难
Would be catastrophic.

511
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:16,095
为了能够抑制它  他们不得不用水泥
So in order to contain it, they're gonna have to cement

512
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,095
注满整个地区就像切尔诺贝利核电站一样
The entire area in, like chernobyl.

513
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,045
这个容器  就是他们建造它的地方
And this containment--the place they built over it--

514
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,089
我想你叫它船舱
I believe you called it "the hatch."

515
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:29,014
天鹅船舱
The swan hatch?

516
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:35,037
因为这场意外
Because of this one accident,

517
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,095
这群人会在接下来20年里
These people is gona spend next twenty years

518
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,036
来抑制那个能量
Keeping that energy at bay...

519
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,066
通过不停的按一个按钮
By pressing a button...

520
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,017
而这个按钮将会被你的朋友Desmond
A button that your friend desmond

521
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,025
在某一天忘了按
Will one day fail to push,

522
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:53,080
而这个就令到你们做的飞机
And that will cause your plane--

523
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:56,037
海洋航空815班机
Oceanic 815--

524
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,043
坠毁到这个岛上
To crash on this island.

525
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:01,035
而因为你们的航班坠毁
And because your plane crashed,

526
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,005
令到有一架货轮被派到这个岛上
A freighter will be sent to this island--

527
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,057
和其他有关的人都在上面
And charlotte was on it and so forth.

528
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,003
这整个相关的一连串事件
This entire chain of events--

529
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,089
将会在今天下午开始发生
It's gonna start happening this afternoon.

530
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,010
可是
But...

531
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:16,088
我们可以改变这一切
We can change that.

532
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:19,036
我一生都致力于研究相对物理
I studied relativistic physics my entire life.

533
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,093
有一个观念一直主导着我
One thing emerged over and over--

534
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:24,012
不可能改变过去  不可能
Can't change the past. Can't do it.

535
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:27,025
已经发生的  早就发生了
Whatever happened, happened. All right?

536
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:31,076
可是我最后发现
But then I finally realized...

537
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,009
我花了大量的时间研究
I had been spending so much time

538
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:37,001
常量
Focused on the constants,

539
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,020
可是我忽略了变量
I forgot about the variables.

540
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:42,023
Jack  你知道在这些公式里面的变量吗
Do you know what the variables in these equations are, jack?

541
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:44,056
不知道
No.

542
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,037
我们
Us.

543
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,094
我们是变量
We're the variables.

544
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,064
人
People.

545
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,023
我们思考  我们讲道理
We think. we reason.

546
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:54,015
我们做不同的选择  我们有自由的思想
We make choices. We have free will.

547
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,007
我们可以改变我们的命运
We can change our destiny.

548
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:03,022
我认为我可以中和那股能量
I think I can negate that energy

549
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,046
在天鹅站下面的那股
Under e swan.

550
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:07,069
我想我可以毁灭它
I think I can destroy it.

551
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:10,071
如果我能的话  那密封舱就不需要被建造
If I can, then that hatch will never be built,

552
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,017
而你们的飞机
And your plane...

553
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,099
将会降落
Your plane will land,

554
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:17,024
在它应该降落的地方
Just like it's supposed to,

555
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:19,078
在洛杉矶
In los angeles.

556
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:29,020
能告诉我你打算怎么去中和这股能量吗
And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?

557
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:34,069
我将会引爆一个氢弹
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

558
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,029
Daniel Faraday
Daniel faraday?

559
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:54,050
你儿子是Danial Faraday
Your son is daniel faraday?

560
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:57,016
是的
Yes.

561
00:36:57,021 --> 00:37:00,096
就是那个叫Desmond去洛杉矶找你的那个
That's the man who sent desmond to los angeles to find you.

562
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,079

你的丈夫变成一个牺牲品
Your husband has become a casualty

566
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:14,082

我不知道
I don't know.

00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:22,023
在很长的一段时间里面 
For the first time in a long time,

570
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:25,082
我第一次不知道将会发生什么

你为何不进出打声招呼
Why don't you go in and say hello?

588
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:51,093
很不幸的 Eloise
Unfortunately, Eloise,

589
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,066

不要跟我说什么叫做牺牲 Charles
Don't you talk to me about sacrifice, Charles.

593
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,038
我必须把我的儿子送回到那个岛上
I had to send my son back to the island,

594
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,097
而且知道将会....
Knowing full well that--

00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,055
他也是我的儿子 Eloise
He was my son, too, Eloise.

596
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:32,091
这是个错误
This is a mistake.

597
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,062
他在提到说
He's talking about

598
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:37,050
把一切发生过在我们身上的事情抹掉
Erasing everything that's ever happened to us, Jack.

599
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:39,000
这是疯狂的
It's insane.

600
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,015
我们在一架飞在半空的飞机上消失
We disappeared off a plane in mid-air

601
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,017
来到1977年

602
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,042
我感觉已经习惯了疯狂
I'm getting kinda used to insane.

603
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:47,044
这应该够了
Well, that should be enough.

604
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,036
我想我们需要多点水
I think we need more water.

605
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:06,008
-祝我好运吧  -等等
- Wish me luck. wait. - Hey.

606
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,040

No, let him go. Let him go.

607
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:29,058
退后 让开 
Back up. Step away. It's oy.

608
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:31,018
都不准动
Nobody move.

609
