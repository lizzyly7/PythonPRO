3
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,018
哇哦! 轻点  蠢驴
Ow! Easy, jackass.

4
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,085
要我轻点就别再抱怨 我得给你换绷带
You want it easy, quit moaning. I got to change these bandages.

5
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,081
好  但别把我的皮也扯下来了
Try not taking my skin off with them.

6
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:27,047
我把你映衬得怎样  Quinn医生?  缓解你良心上的不安了?
How'd I score the house call, Dr.Quinn? Trying to ease your conscience?

7
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,009
我良心上没什么不安  谢谢
My conscience is fine, thanks.

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
当然  有什么事情会让你内疚?
Of course, what have you got to feel guilty about?

9
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:37,002
我是说  你让那个该死的阿拉伯人折磨我  自己却站在一旁观看
I mean, you just let that damn Arab torture me.Stood by and watched.

10
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:40,002
现在又想修补你我之间的关系  给自己买去天堂的飞机票?
Now you figure you'll patch me up and buy you a ticket into heaven?

11
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,015
你在这儿的唯一原因是...
Only reason you're here...

12
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:45,015
我在这儿是因为  没有一个人想和你扯上关系
I'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you.

13
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,045
她会的
She does.

14
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:00,008
自己换绷带去
Change your own bandages.

15
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,039
找人呢?  还是欣赏风景?
Looking for someone,or just admiring the view?

16
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:19,043
Sayid独自离开已经两天了
It's been two days since Sayid took off on his own.

17
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,048
我一直期待着能看到他回来
I keep thinking I'm gonna see him.

18
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,056
等到他找到要找的东西后  他会回来的...
He'll come when he's found what he's looking for,

19
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,044
-那个法国人的求救传输信号  -他不是去找东西
-The French transmission.  -He wasn't looking for anything.

20
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,049
他离开是因为之前发生的事
He left because of what happened.

21
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,028
-是因为他自己的行为  -那是个意外
-for what he did  -It was an accident.

22
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,099
意外却发生在你折磨人的时候 Jack
Well, accidents happen when you torture people, Jack.

23
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,050
Sayid是个训练有素的军人  Kate
Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate.

24
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,042
他会照顾好自己
He can take care of himself.

25
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,039
有人吗?
Hello?

26
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,006
有人吗?
Hello?

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,009
把他赶出去!  他在喝我们的水
Ew! Get him out of there! He's drinking our water.

28
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,025
那儿怎么了?
What's going on out there?

29
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,013
你知道  和往常一样
You know, the usual.

30
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,047
为了点小事情争来争去
People yelling at each other.

31
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,080
医生  你觉得这是...  这是...
Doc, what do you think this is, this...

32
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:04,097
这皮疹?  很糟是吗?  是那种热带病?
...this rash? It's bad, right? Some kind of a tropical disease?

33
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,039
-是麻疹  -那是什么?
-It's hives.  -What's that?

34
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,006
毒葛之类的东西吗?
Is that like poison ivy?

35
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,048
这是一种很普通的皮疹  有时候是由于热和压力引起的
It's a common rash, sometimes brought on by heat and stress.

36
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:14,011
放松就行了
Just try to relax.

37
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,090
-都弄干净了  -好
-It'll clear up.  -Right.

38
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,015
不要老想着它
Try to keep your mind off it.

39
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,028
好的  这是什么?  芦荟吗?
Okay.What is that? Is that like aloe?

40
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,095
用来防晒的吗?  还是其它用途?
Isn't that for sunburn or something?

41
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:25,058
"不要老想着它"?
"Try to keep your mind off it"?

42
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,095
那家伙除了给自己增加压力  还能干什么?
What else has that guy got to do but stress?

43
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,058
我事情已经够多了  没必要连忧郁症也治吧
I have enough without having to treat hypochondriacs.

44
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,071
是  那正是我要说的
That's like my point, man.

45
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,096
大家都备受煎熬
We're all fried.

46
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,038
我是说
I mean

47
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,034
你去看过那儿的人了吗?
have you taken a look at everybody out there?

48
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,072
每个人都很焦虑
Everybody's way tense.

49
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:46,039
老兄  我想说的是  我们最好能干点什么...
Dude, I'm just saying,it... it'd be sweet if we could have...

50
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,098
我不知道  至少干点什么
I don't know, something to do.

51
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:52,023
我们都还活着  Hurley
We're surviving here, Hurley.

52
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:55,015
那才是我要干的事  保证每个人都活着
And that's my main concern, is keeping us alive.

53
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,007
事情可能会变得更糟
Things could be worse.

54
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:03,003
怎么变?
How?

55
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,096
Alex在哪?
Where is Alex?

56
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,049
什么?
What?

57
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,028
你是谁?
Who are you?

58
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:54,017
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you are talking about.

59
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,051
Alex在哪?
Where is Alex?

60
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,043
求你  不要....
Please, let's not...

61
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:11,027
-Alex在哪?  -我不认识什么Alex
-Where is Alex?  -I don't know any Alex.

62
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,011
住手!
Stop!

63
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,062
你要我住手  Flahn?

64
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,087
那就回答我的问题

65
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:37,013
我可以折磨你一整天

66
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,063
我向你保证  我们已经了解了事情真相

67
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,068
但我要你承认

68
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:52,089
你就不会再遭受任何痛苦
And all the pain will stop.

69
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:57,056
你的什叶派教徒朋友向我们暗示  你参与了爆炸事件
Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing.

70
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,074
是你把爆炸装置安装在政党总部  是不是?
You planted the device in the headquarters!

71
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:06,032
你杀了两个士兵!
You killed two soldiers!

72
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,028
承认吧
Confess it

73
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:13,012
承认的话  或许你可以保住你的小命  我们要你的手就够了
and perhaps it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.

74
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,021
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

75
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:25,009
-你的消息有错  -也许吧
-Your sources were wrong.  -Perhaps.

76
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,009
但那不是关键  是吧?
But that's really not the point, is it?

77
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,039
你在那儿把自己掌控的非常好
You handled yourself well in there.

78
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,047
是吗?
Did I?

79
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:36,085
我已经提交了你的调职申请  如果你仍想调职的话
I put in for your reassignment to intelligence division, If you still wish it.

80
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,090
是的  长官  非常想
Yes, sir. Very much so.

81
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:43,073
很好  只有我们两个人的时候  不用叫我"长官"
Good. But stop calling me "sir" when it's just the two of us.

82
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,090
你是我的上级指挥  Omar...至少现在还是
You're my superior officer, Omar.

83
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,041
在你未调职之前  我很高兴你这么叫
For now.And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

84
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,058
那倒提醒了我  Sayid
That reminds me,

85
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,066
除了你越来越重的责任
in addition to your increased responsibilities,

86
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,042
官位的提升和你的能力很相称
a promotion is commensurate with your move.

87
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:01,079
如果你不会怀念当一位审讯官的话
That is, if you won't miss being a communications officer.

88
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,013
我愿意作出那样的牺牲
I am willing to make that sacrifice.

89
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,005
很好
Good.

90
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,044
这是什么?
Yo. What's this?

91
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:22,011
在丛林里找到的  一定是飞机上掉下来的
They must have fallen from the plane.

92
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,069
你们昨晚在丛林里干什么?
What are you doing in the jungle at night?

93
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:25,073
打猎的好时间
Best time to hunt.

94
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,061
Ethan有些经验
Ethan here has some experience.

95
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:30,066
他发现了一些足迹  看起来像兔子的或其它啮齿动物
He spotted tracks that might be a rabbit or some other rodent.

96
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,091
啮齿动物  妙极了
Rodent. Yum.

97
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:35,033
我想人们已经吃厌了野猪肉
People are getting tired of boar meat.

98
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,070
你说对了
You got that right.

99
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,038
好  我看看
All right, well,I'll take a look at these,

100
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:43,054
看有没用的着东西
See if there's anything useful.

101
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,034
好
Okay.

102
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,023
Locke先生
Mr. Locke.

103
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,077
你还要回去打猎吗?
Are you going back out to hunt?

104
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,032
再打一会儿
For a bit.

105
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:08,069
我可以一起去吗?  我是说...
Can I go with you? I mean,

106
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,082
我想向你学习怎么做你做的事
I just want to learn how to do what you do.

107
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,082
Walt!

108
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,053
我只是...  我只是和Locke先生谈谈关于....
I was... I was talking to Mr. Locke about...

109
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:18,062
我知道你在干什么  不可能的事  回到床上来
I know what you're doing. Not gonna happen, man. Get back to bed.

110
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,055
老兄...
Whoa, dude...

111
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,056
请听我说!
Please just listen to me!

112
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,060
我说了很多遍了  我不认识Alex!
I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is!

113
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,002
我是一个飞机失事的幸存者
I'm a survivor of a plane crash.

114
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,023
偶然在海滩边发现了这根绳索
I found the wire on the beach.

115
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,099
就沿着绳索走过来了
I followed it.

116
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:53,011
我想这或许和...
I thought it might have something to do with

117
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,028
和我们接收到的求救信号有关
a transmission we picked up on a receiver.

118
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,054
一个留言  一个求救信号
A recording, a mayday

119
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:03,083
是一个法国女子的声音  已经重复循环了16年了
with a French woman repeating on a loop for 16 years.

120
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,035
16年
Sixteen years.

121
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,061
真有那么长吗?
Has it really been that long?

122
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,086
你...
You.

123
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:37,066
你会碰巧收到了我的求救信号?
You just happened to hear my distress call?

124
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,029
我知道你是什么样的人
I know what you are.

125
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,065
Rousseau

126
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:13,040
-你怎么知道我的名字?  -我读的
-How do you know my name?  -I read it.

127
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,099
那儿  在夹克衫上
There, on the jacket.

128
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,016
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

129
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,070
那些电池...
Those batteries

130
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,058
还不足以产生如此多的能量
wouldn't be able to produce enough power

131
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:28,050
来传输一个历经这么多年的求救信号
to transmit your distress call all these years.

132
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,063
是其它地方传输的信号
Broadcasts from somewhere else.

133
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,067
但被他们控制了
But they control it now.

134
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,067
他们?
They?

135
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,043
你
You.

136
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:40,039
以及其它像你一样的人
And the others like you.

137
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:46,010
我不知道你对我怎么想的  我已经告诉过你了
I... I don't know who you think I am. I've already told you.

138
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,085
-我不是....  -Sayid?
-I am not...  -Sayid?

139
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,007
你怎么知道我的...
How...?

140
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:55,003
我的名字在我的夹克衫上  你的名字在你带来的信上
My name was on a jacket. Yours is on the envelope you carry.

141
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,099
她是谁?
Who is she?

142
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,020
照片中的女子
The woman in the photographs.

143
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,079
Nadia

144
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,088
她叫Nadia
Her name is Nadia.

145
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,042
我们不能直接把 Noor Abed Jazeem 和爆炸事件联系起来
We cannot tie Noor Abed Jazeem to the bombing,

146
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,030
但我们知道她效忠什么样的人
but we know her sympathies.

147
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:22,093
她是一个众人皆知的  库尔德人和什叶派起义者的联系人
She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.

148
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,068
你认为她知道谁策划了  这起爆炸事件?
She knows who orchestrated the bombing?

149
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:29,002
我的朋友  那就是你要去搞清楚的
That, my friend,is exactly what you will find out.

150
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,007
Noor Abed Jazeem

151
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:41,041
我要问你些问题
I'm going to ask you some questions.

152
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,083
如果你拒绝合作  我会对你动手  明白吗?
If you refuse to cooperate, I'm going to hurt you.

153
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,087
没人叫我Noor, Sayid
Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid.

154
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,087
你们所有人都应该知道的
You of all people should know that.

155
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,063
什么?
What?

156
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,088
你不记得我了?
You don't remember me?

157
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:06,026
曾在操场上把你推进泥浆里的  小女孩现在变化有这么大吗?
Am I so different from the girl in the schoolyard who used to push you in the mud?

158
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,098
Nadia

159
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,048
还有你妈妈告诉我妈妈  "为什么你非要选中小Sayid?"
And your mother would tell my mother, "Why must you pick on little Sayid?"

160
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:20,011
我回答  "因为他忽视我"
And I'd answer, "Because he ignores me."

161
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:26,024
你得到大家足够的关注  家里又有钱还有...
You had enough attention, with your family's wealth and...

162
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,004
你很迷人
your charm.

163
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,058
很少有小孩子关注这种事情
Such things matter little to children.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,088
但你总是显得很老成  是不是  Sayid?
But then, you always were older than your years,weren't you, Sayid?

165
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:42,038
我还没老成到能理解  "把我推到泥浆里"算是一种喜欢的暗示
Not old enough to understand that being pushed was a sign of affection.

166
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,089
如今你背叛了你的国家
Now you're a traitor to your country.

167
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,077
告诉我你对爆炸事件了解多少  Nadia
Tell me what you know about the bombing, Nadia.

168
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,099
告诉我  否则  我发誓我一定会伤害你
Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you.

169
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,028
我知道  Sayid
Hmm. Oh, I know, Sayid.

170
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,074
这不是我第一次被共和卫队审问了
This is not my first interrogation by the Republican Guard.

171
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,025
这就是他们在我身上扑浓酸的地方
This is where they burned me with acid.

172
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,021
他们用钻头在我的掌心钻孔
They pierced my hands with a drill.

173
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,058
你想看看我的脚底吗?
Would you like to see the soles of my feet?

174
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,059
那是他们把皮扯去的地方
Where they flayed the skin off?

175
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,018
这些都是你的朋友的手艺
These are handiworks of your friends.

176
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:26,068
我曾经却还发誓效忠这些人
The people you swear allegiance to.

177
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,039
如果你是清白的  我很抱歉
If you were innocent, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,035
但这起爆炸事件事关重大
But this bombing is a different matter.

179
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:38,052
-Nadia...  -干吧  Sayid
-Nadia...  -Go on, Sayid.

180
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,065
干你的工作
Do your work.

181
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,090
我什么都不会跟你说的
I'm not going to tell you anything.

182
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,012
那我就动手了
Then I'm going to hurt you.

183
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,079
我知道
I know.

184
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,091
你有子弹疤痕
You have a bullet wound.

185
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,079
我曾是个军人
I was a soldier.

186
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,054
曾是?
You were?

187
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,001
现在还是?
And are you still?

188
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,009
那已经是很久前的事了
It was a long time ago.

189
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:16,006
多讲些她的事
Tell me more about her,the woman.

190
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,027
Nadia

191
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,078
Alex... 他是谁?
Alex... who is he?

192
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,066
我无聊死了!
I'm bored.

193
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,091
我可以带Vincent去海边吗?
Can I take Vincent to the beach?

194
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,083
我过会儿带你去  小子
Um... I'll take you later.

195
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,004
我处理点事情
I'm in the middle of something.

196
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,050
但实在没事可干
But there's nothing to do.

197
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,092
你得想些事做做  知道我的意思吗?
Well, you got to figure out stuff to do.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,067
你得给自己找些娱乐节目
You got to find a way to entertain yourself.

199
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,009
拜托  拜托  我知道我看到了
Come on. Come on. I know I saw it.

200
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,009
好的

210

-我没说谎  -说谎!
-I'm not lying.  -Lies!

211
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:19,042
像那些什么飞机失事啦  你存活了 还有其它幸存者啦

你没听说北极熊?

对  娱乐

在这儿的头几年 这东西成了我最大的安慰

她写的还是你写的?

或许你不想告诉我  因为有太多的痛苦
Perhaps you don't want to tell me because it causes too much pain.

我是说  我知道该怎么做  但...

00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,000
-没有机会的!  -不要打飞了!
-No chance!  -Don't blow it!

284
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:06,080
你打不到我们周围的!
You won't get anywhere near us!

285
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,075
医生!  你在这儿呀

有人说你朝这边来了

我为镇静剂的事道歉

要移动你  这是我能想到的唯一的安全的办法

你提议要帮我修音乐盒

301
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,011
我叫Danielle

302
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:38,058
你是怎么来到这个岛上的 Danielle?
And how did you come to be on this island, Danielle?

303
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,010
我们是一支科考队的
We were part of a science team.

304
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,064

-Robert也在队里吗?  -是的

306
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,023
还有Alex... 他也是?

307
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:08,053
通讯设备坏了的时候  我们的船离开塔西提岛已经三天了
Our vessel was three days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned.

308
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,024
那是个晚上
It was night.

309
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,041
那暴雨...
The storm...

310
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,079
那咆哮...
The sounds...

311
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,067
船只被甩到了岩石上
The ship slammed into rocks,

312
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,034
冲到了地面  船体破裂到了无法修补的程度

313
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:27,088
所以...
So...

314
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,072
我们扎了营

315
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,030
找到了这个临时庇护所
Dug out this temporary shelter.

316
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:37,064
临时的

317
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:42,081
我们在这儿活了将近两个月
Nearly two months we survived here.

318
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,077
两个月  然后....
Two months before...

319
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:50,003
你的求救信号... 我接收到的...
Your distress signal. The message I heard.

320
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,045
你说  "它把他们都杀了"
You said "It killed them all."

321
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,025
我们从黑岩那儿回来
We were coming back from the black rock.

322
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,030
是他们
It was them.

323
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,051
-他们是携带者  -谁是携带者?

324
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:19,097
其他人
The others.

325
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,069
其他什么人?
What others?

326
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:25,086
"黑岩"是什么?
What is the black rock?

327
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,061
你在岛上看到其他人了?
Have you seen other people on this island?

328
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:31,049
没有
No.

329
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,070
但我听到了
But I hear them.

330
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:37,012
在丛林里面
Out there in the jungle.

331
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,016
他们低声细语
They whisper.

332
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,092
你认为我疯了
You think I'm insane.

333
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,077
我想你独处的太久了
I think you've been alone for too long.

334
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:21,045
我很抱歉  我只能找到这些了
I'm sorry. This is all I could find.

335
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,091
我会再找找  稍后给你带些水果
I'll try and bring you some fruit later on.

336
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,038
准备说了?
Are you ready to talk?

337
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,058
那取决于...
That depends on

338
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,067
...你想谈什么  Sayid
what you'd like to talk about, Sayid.

339
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:34,034
书?
Books?

340
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,018
天气?
Weather?

341
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,035
我被锁在这地牢  几周没见过书和天气了
Since I've seen neither locked in this cell for weeks,

342
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:42,006
恐怕我们的交谈会很不顺畅
I'm afraid my conversation will suffer.

343
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:44,027
有两个嫌疑犯在我们的监管下
We have two suspects in custody.

344
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,073
看这些照片
Have a look at these photographs.

345
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,098
你所要做的就是点头而已
All you need to do is nod.

346
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,065
如果你能证明自己愿意合作
If you prove you're willing to cooperate,

347
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,032
我想我能说服他们放了你的
I think I can get them to free you.

348
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:04,037
那样我就再也期待不到这样的"访问"了
Then I won't have these visits to look forward to anymore.

349
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,008
这不是个游戏  Nadia
This isn't a game, Nadia.

350
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,054
你却还在玩  Sayid
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

351
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:16,055
假装一些事(骗我)  我知道你不是
Pretending to be something I know you're not.

352
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,056
你不会相信的
You'll never believe this.

353
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:29,085
你终于知道怎么系鞋带了?
You learned how to tie your shoes?

354
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:32,086
有趣  洞里有个家伙建了个高尔夫球场
Funny. Someone at the caves built a golf course.

355
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:35,003
-你很兴奋?  -真的  一个高尔夫球场
-Are you high?  -Seriously, a golf course.

356
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,094
显然  Jack他们现在在一块儿玩
Jack's playing right now.

357
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:41,012
-Jack?  打高尔夫?  -我听说是这样
-Jack? Is golfing?  -That's what I hear.

358
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,049
我不知道你们怎么想  但我要去看看
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna check this out.

359
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,024
等等我  笨蛋
Wait for me, bonehead.

360
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:56,046

还会发生什么  偷吃炸面圈?
What's next, cop eating a donut?

363
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,084
如果你要来  说就行了
If you want to come, you should say.

364
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:06,080
我不屑一顾  雀斑女 我不热衷于集体活动
Think I'll pass on that, Freckles. Not big on crowds.

365
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,076
让我们面对吧  我也对人群不敢兴趣
And let's face it, crowd's not too hot on me, either.

366
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,060
一个接一个被遗弃
One outcast to another,

367
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,064
我在想我们得多努力一点
I'd think about making more of an effort.

回到我跟你说过的人群中去

378
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:15,083
-不安全  -不安全?  什么不安全?

如果我们幸运  是其中一只熊

那女子什么消息都没给我们
The Jazeem woman has given us nothing.

389
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,014
这会让其它人觉得我们不会逼供

390
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,064
再多给我些时间

你怎么想出这点子的?

不是我  都是Hurley弄的

这是加击  加击
It's a Mulligan.

这是一项绅士运动  你得明白这个词  "加击"
A gentleman's sport. You got to get the words right.

414

他们不会检查这辆车的外出

进来的时候才会检查

躲到里面  不管用什么  一定要把自己遮盖起来

30分钟内  他们赶不到市里
