我和他们做了笔交易 如果我照顾好Ben
I'd made a deal with them... If I took care of Ben,

23
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,089
他们会让我离开这座岛
that they'd let me off the island.

24
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,099
我也不知道是不是真的 我就低调行事
I don't know. I just kept my head down,

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,030
做我该做的
did what I was supposed to,

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,000
不问任何问题
and I didn't ask any questions.

27
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,010
就这些了吗?
And that's it?

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040

我不该走 如果你又病了该怎么办?
I shouldn't go. What if you get sick again?

你是谁?

67

如果我告诉你
If I told you who I was,

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,059
如果我告诉你我知道的一切
if I told you everything that I know,

69
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,080
你会杀了我的
you'd kill me.

Claire?

88
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,060
Claire?

89
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,069

90
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,039
好了  不哭了
It's okay.

91
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,079
Claire

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,090
你还好吗?
You okay?

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,040
Chaile

94
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,009
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

95
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,059
-你没听见Aaron吗?  -他还好吗?
-Didn't you hear Aaron?  -Is he okay?

96
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,089
他很好 你没事吧?
No, he's okay, he's okay.Are you all right?

97
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,039
我只是感到有点头晕
Yeah, I just...feel a little bit off.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,089
大概没睡好
I didn't sleep well.

99
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,089
真不敢相信我没听见他哭
I can't believe I didn't hear him crying.

100
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,019
也许有些感冒了吧
Maybe you're coming down with something.

101
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,009
还是让我来照顾Aaron
But why don't you let me take Aaron,

102
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,039
-你好好休息一下吧  -你不介意吧?
-and you get some more rest?  -Yeah, do you mind?

103
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
当然
Absolutely.

104
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,050
我不会睡很久的
I won't sleep... long.

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,070
我猜让他们就这样等 应该没什么用吧
I guess it's no use asking them to wait up, huh?

106
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,079
他们会接受你的 给他们点时间
They'll come around. Just give them some time.

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,039
我们的人把Sayid锁在秋千上三天
My people kept Sayid chained to a swing set for three days.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,099
然后我拽着Kate来到丛林
Then I dragged Kate into the jungle,

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,080
把她和我拷在一起 还撒了谎
handcuffed myself to her and lied about it.

110
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,090
他们还需要时间想吗?
How much time do you think they need?

111
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,079
还有几小时就到海滩了
We'll be back to our beach a couple hours.

112
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,010
那时候他们大概就接受你了
They'll probably be over it by then.

113
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,019
你紧张吗?
You nervous?

114
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
当然
Hell, yes.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,059
我知道六个月确实很长
I know that six months sounds like an eternity,

116
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,099
但在那里
but you're gonna be amazed

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,049
你会感到时间过的很快
at how time flies once you're there.

118
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,069
我迫不及待的想知道 我们要去哪儿了?
I can't wait to find out where "there" is.

119
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,019
Burke医生 请坐吧
Dr.Burke, wanna have a seat?

120
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,060
我要给你做下体检
I'd like to take some of your vitals,

121
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,009
如果你不介意的话
if that's okay with you.

122
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,000
当然  没问题
Yeah, sure.

123
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,089
公司的每个人都很期待
Everyone at the company is really excited

124
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,079
你的到来 Burke医生
about you coming down, Dr.Burke,

125
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,099
而你的研究成果
and I think your research

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,030
将会对我们的工程有很大的推动
is really gonna have a major impact on us.

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,069
那是什么?
What is that?

128
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,080
那是橙汁  加了一定计量的安眠药
That is orange juice with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.

129
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,069
你想让我喝了它?
You want me to drink it?

130
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,049
这一路上你一定会想睡觉的 Burke医生
Oh, yes. You're gonna want to be asleep for the trip, Dr.Burke.

131
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,020
那会很颠簸的
It can be kind of intense.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,069
我在你们的合同上签了字
I was fine with signing all of your paperwork,

133
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,049
还同意在六个月里
fine with agreeing to not talk

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,039
不和我生活中的任何人说话
to anyone in my life for six months,

135
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,059
接受在医学界
fine with the fact that no one in the medical community

136
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,030
-没有一个人听说过Mittelos这个公司  -你为什么会接受?
-has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience  -Why were you fine?

137
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,089
-什么?  -你为什么会接受那些的?
-What?  -Why were you fine with those things?

138
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,089
这看起来像是你工作的一个巨大的转折点
It seems like quite a leap for a job opportunity,

139
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,020
而且我们给你的报酬也不是很多
and we're not paying you that much.

140
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,009
我想是因为在你内心深处
I think you're fine because deep down, a part of you knows

141
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,000
告诉你 我们要带你去的地方很特别
that the place we're taking you to is special.

142
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,009
特别?
Special, huh?

143
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,070
问你个问题 Juliet
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

144
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,029
你让一个女人 你的亲妹妹
You took a woman... Your own sister,

145
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,019
一个生殖系统被化疗破坏
whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy,

146
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,059
一个不能生育的人 你让她怀孕了
who is sterile, and you made her pregnant.

147
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,040
你创造了本不该被创造的生命
You created life where life wasn't supposed to be.

148
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,099
这是一种天赋 Juliet
That's a gift, Juliet.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,009
你有这种天赋
You have a gift.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,020
做一些不平凡的事吗?
to do something significant with it?

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
我们要去的地方 你就可以做到这些
Where we're going, you can do just that.

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,059
我们到底要去哪儿?
Where exactly are we going?

153
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,090
我还不能告诉你
I can't tell you that,

154
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,019
但我能告诉你
but what I can tell you is that

155
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,089
你将在那里见到
you'll see things there

156
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,040
你从未想象到的东西
that you never imagined.

157
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,069
没人强迫你做任何事
Now no one is forcing you to do anything,

158
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,099
如果你改变主意的话
so if you change your mind,

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,030
我们很乐意送你回去...
we're happy to take you back to...

160
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,050
你不该喝那么快的
You probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.

161
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,050
早上好
Good morning.

162
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,079
没事的  你会在接下来的几个小时里感到嗓子很难受
No, no, it's okay. You'll be hoarse for a few hours,

163
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,059
但会慢慢好起来的
but it gets better as the day goes on.

164
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,039
很抱歉绑着你
Sorry I had to strap you in,

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,059
但最后一段路程总有些颠簸
but the last leg is always a little bumpy.

166
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,000
小心你的头 把手给我
Watch your head. Give me your hand.

167
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,039
我们到了
We're here.

168
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,050
到哪儿了?
Here where?

169
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,020

注意脚下
Watch your step here.

173
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,039
水太多了
Hey, that's too much water.

174
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,049
会很稀的
It's gonna be all soggy.

175
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,050
这是燕麦片  伙计 当然要稀的才好
It's oatmeal, dude. It's supposed to be soggy.

176
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,040
这不是三个爸爸和一个小娃娃嘛
Well, if it ain't three men and a baby.

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,020
我把Hugo算两个人
I counted Hugo twice.

178
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,020
又怎么了? 我又没叫你绰号
Oh, what? Come on. I used your name.

179
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,029
这里还有阿斯匹林吗?
Does anybody know where there's any aspirin?

180
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,059
Clarie 你脸色很差
Claire, you don't look so good.

181
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,039
你起来干什么? 你应该在休息的
What are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.

182
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,079
我知道  只是我感到头很沉
Yeah, no, I know. My head is pounding.

183
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,059
交给我吧  两片阿斯匹林马上送到
I got you covered. Two aspirin coming right up.

184
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
谢谢
Thank you.

185
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,000
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

186
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,050
Jack  是Jack!

187
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,019

189
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,080

医生
Doctor.

192
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,070
她在这里干什么?
What the hell is she doing here?

193
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,050
那么说...
So...

194
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,090
你是他们的人咯?
You're, like, one of them, huh?

195
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,010
我叫Juliet
I'm Juliet.

196
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,080
我不记得在码头见过你...
I don't remember you from the dock...

197
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,090
在那里你们用袋子套住我们的头...
Where you put bags on our heads...

198
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,060
你们吓到了我们
After you shocked us.

199
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,000
我那天休息
I had the day off.

200
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,039
听说你是个医生
So I hear you're a doctor.

201
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,090
其实我是个研究人员
I'm really more of a researcher.

202
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,020
他们让你来盯着我?
They send you over here to keep an eye on me?

203
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,030
好吧
Ok.

204
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,060
你们的一个人 Ethan...
The last one of you guys that came over here... Ethan...

205
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,040
他绑架了Clarie Charlie很生气
He kidnapped Claire, and Charlie got upset.

206
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,020
我们把他埋在那边
We buried him over there.

207
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,040
她死了 Juliet  她死了
She's gone, Juliet. She's dead.

208
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,070
没关系的  你尽力了
It's okay. You tried.

209
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,090
你干嘛不去休息一下呢?
Why don't you go ahead and take off?

210
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,070
我会和Ben说的
I'll talk to Ben.

211
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,070
怀孕是Sabine自己的决定
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

212
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,070
她知道要承担风险的
She knew she was taking a risk.

213
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,090
我认为是怀孕时发生的
I think it happens at conception,

214
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,029
我就无能为力了
there's nothing I can do about it,

215
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,079
-至少是在这里  -我不是很明白
-at least not here.  -I'm not sure I understand.

216
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,019
唯一的办法是
The only way to see if I'm right

217
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,079
带她离开这个岛 回到迈阿密
is to take a woman off the island, back to Miami.

218
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,000
不  你不能把任何人带离这座岛
No. You're not taking anybody off the island.

219
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,009
如果这样的话 我就无能为力了
In that case, there's thing more I can do.

220
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,079
我知道你对我寄予厚望 Ben
I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben,

221
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,080
我很抱歉帮不了你
and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

222
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
我妹妹三个月后就要生产了...
My sister's giving birth in three months...

223
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,020
而我连个电话也没打给过她

224
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,020
是时候让我回家了
It's time for me to go home.

225
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,030
你妹妹生不了孩子了 Juliet
Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet.

226
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,029
在这之前她就会死
She'll be dead before then.

227
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,090
她的癌症又复发了
Her cancer's back.

228
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,099
-你从哪里弄到这些的?  -Mikhail 我很抱歉 我早该告诉你的
-Where did you get this?  -Mikhail.Sorry.I should have told you sooner.

229
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,029
我只是不知道有什么好处...
But I didn't see what good it would do...

230
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,039
有什么好处?! 我本该回家的!
What good it would do?! Could have gone home!

231
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,020
-我本该和她在一起!  -你依然可以
-I could have been with her!  -You still can.

232
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,069
你可以回家 Juliet 陪伴她走过最后的日子
You can go home, Juliet, be with her in her final days,

233
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,090
你也可以留下 帮助我解决问题
or you can stay here and help me with our problem.

234
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,059
我为什么要留下?
Why would I stay?

235
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,070
因为我可以帮你治好你妹妹
Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer.

236
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,079
我应该相信你吗?
I'm supposed to take that on faith?

237
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,039
你在这里六个月了
You've been here for six months.

238
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,099
你做了广泛的研究
You've done extensive workups on all of us.

239
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,049
-你有发现癌症吗?  -那是因为在这里
-Have you seen even a trace of cancer?  -That's here!

240
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,009
而你不肯把我妹妹带来
And being that you won't let me bring my sister here,

241
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,030
-我就需要更多...  -Jacob说他会照顾好自己的
-I'm gonna need more...  -Jacob said he would take care of it himself.

242
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,090
除非你不信任他
Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him.

243
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,010
岛上的每个女人都需要你
Every woman on this island needs you.

244
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,039
如果你留下
If you choose to stay,

245
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,019
我向你保证
I promise you,

246
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,070
我们会治好Rachel的 
we will save Rachel's life.

247
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,039
相信她? 她是他们的人
Trust her? She's one of them.

248
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,009
不再是了 他们把她扔下了
Not anymore. They left her behind.

249
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,049
-是吗? 那他们去哪儿了?  -我也不知道
-Oh, yeah? Where'd they go?  -I told you. I don't know.

250
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,019
-也许我们最好问问她  -她自己也不知道
-Maybe we better ask her.  -She doesn't know either.

251
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,049
我有个主意  让伊拉克人去对付她
Here's a wacky idea. Let's sic our resident Iraqi on her,

252
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,079
-做他擅长的 然后看她怎么说  -我不在这么做了
-let him do what he does,then see what she says.  -I don't do that anymore.

253
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,099
这样不是很好吗?
Well, ain't that convenient?

254
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,089
但我不相信她 Jack 如果她真的那么无辜...
But I don't trust her, Jack. If she's so innocent...

255
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,049
那她为什么不回答我们的问题呢?
why won't she answer our questions?

256
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,039
-先给她点时间 她也受惊吓了  -要多少时间?
-Just give her some time. She's afraid.  -How much time?

257
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,000
-我相信她就足够了  -这还不够
-Look, the fact that I trust her should be enough.  -It's not.

258
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,019
Locke去哪儿了?
Where did Locke go?

259
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,009
他在炸了那潜艇之后 就和他们走了...
He went with them, right after he destroyed the sub...

260
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,009
那艘潜艇原本可以带我离开这里
The sub that was gonna take me off this island.

261
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,089
-什么?  -他们让你走?
-What?  -They were gonna let you go?

262
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,080
-是啊  -谁说的?
-Yeah.  -Said who?

263
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,079
Ben

264
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,089
Ben...

265
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,049
-你还救了他的命  -Sawyer 别说了
-Whose life you saved.  -Sawyer, lay off.

266
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,039
该让那暴眼杂种去死的
Shoulda let that bug-eyed bastard die!

267
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,079
-他这么做是为了我们  -听起来更像是为了自己
-He did it for us.  -Sounds like he did it for him.

268
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,029
你有什么要问我的吗?
Is there something you wanna ask me?

269
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,089
是啊  Jack

270
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,079
你为什么要为他们的人辩护呢?
I wanna ask you why you're fighting every single one of us and sticking up for one of them?

271
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,059
我在那里一直都在寻找
I spent every moment over there

272
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,069
离开这里的办法 我是在帮助我们所有人

我想让大家得救
I was trying to get us rescued.

274
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,099

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,030

276
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,079
抓住她  抓住她
Grab her, grab her.

277
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,029
把她抱起来
Let's get her up. Let's get her up.

278
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,059

-No,she was fine.  -What about water?Has she been drinking enough water?

282

-during the late stages of her pregnancy.  -Designed by who?

300
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,089
我
By me.

301
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,099
不知什么原因 这里的女人都不能生育
For some reason the women here can't have babies.

302
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,029
母亲的身体"拒绝"怀孕
The mother's body turns on the pregnancy,

303
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,009
认为是某种入侵者
treats it as a foreign invader.

304
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,029
我看着这些不断的发生
I saw it happen over and over.

305
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,070
在这座岛上的每个孕妇都会死...
Every pregnant woman on this island died...

306
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,060
当然  直到Clarie的出现
That is,every pregnant woman until Claire.

307
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,030
你对她做了什么?
What did you do to her?

308
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,020
我们中的一个人潜入了你们的营地
One of our people infiltrated your camp

309
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,079
采集血样
and began taking blood samples

310
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,030
就在飞机失事后不久
right after your plane crashed.

311
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,019
Ethan

312
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,019
即使Clarie不是在这座岛上受孕的
Even though Claire didn't conceive on this island,

313
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,089
我们发现她的情况和这里其他孕妇是一样的
we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers,

314
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,059
-我们只想救她的命  -通过绑架她?
-so we tried to save her life.  -By kidnapping her?

315
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,049
那本不该发生的
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

316
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,039
她原本在我们的控制范围内 我发现了一种血清
She was our control case.I had developed a serum that

317
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,039
可以让她的身体回到从前的状态
I thought would reverse what was happening to her.

318
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,060
Ethan负责注射
Ethan was administering the injections.

319
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,049
但你们发现了他原本不在飞机上
Then you found out that he wasn't on the plane.

320
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,049
人数统计...我问了所有人
The census... I interviewed everyone.

321
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,089
有一个人不在名单里
One of them isn't in the manifest.

322
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,049
他不在飞机上
He wasn't on the plane.

323
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,019
所以他改变了计划
So... he improvised.

324
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
你们好
Hello there.

325
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,069
他自己绑架了她
He kidnapped her on his own.

326
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,010
那不在计划之中
That was never the plan.

327
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,059
我知道这不可相信
Look, I know how this sounds,

328
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,019
但没有那些注射 Clarie早就死了
but without those injections, Claire would have died.

329
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,069
没有了那些血清她会出现症状
Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal,

330
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,049
如果我不及时帮她注射
and if I don't treat her quickly,

331
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,099
她的免疫系统将彻底崩溃
her immune system could shut down entirely.

332
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,079
Jack 我能挽救她 我所需要的就是血清
Jack, I can fix this.I just need the serum.

333
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,059
Ethan在山洞那边
Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies

334
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,039
有一些医疗用具
near the caves where you used to live.

335
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,079
如果我现在就去的话
If I go right now,

336
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,090
我还能及时赶回来
I can be back before it's too late.

337
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,030
就这样吧
Do it.

338
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,000
快去吧
Get moving.

339
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,090
你在哪儿?
Where are you?

340
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,060
床上...和你在一起
In bed... with you.

341
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,039
那你以前在哪里?
And where were you?

342
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,070
我刚意识到...
I was just realizing...

343
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,080
到明天我就在这个岛上整整3年了
that tomorrow I will have been on this island for three years.

344
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,040
那我得做个蛋糕了
Then I better bake a cake.

345
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,010
呆在这儿
Stay here.

346
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,090
那是什么?
What have you got there?

347
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,020
Karl给我拿来了X光片
Karl developed some x-rays for me.

348
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,010
怎么了?
What's wrong?

349
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
早上好 Juliet
Morning, Juliet.

350
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,069
好啊
Hi.

351
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,029
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

352
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,019
当然
Of course.

353
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,049
我刚读完"Carrie"
I was just finishing "Carrie."

354
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,079
我不知道你为什么选这本
I still don't know why you picked it,

355
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,040
-但这真让人压抑  -你有个肿瘤
-but, boy, is it depressing.  -You have a tumor.

356
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,049
什么? 当你说你背痛时
What? When you told me about your back pain,

357
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,039
我说要给你照X光
I said that I would take some x-rays

358
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,079
看看是否是小骨折还是脊椎间盘突出
to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc,

359
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,000
但那不是你的问题
but that's not your problem.

360
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,090
在L4椎骨上有个很大的肿瘤
Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your L4 vertebra.

361
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,009
你很惊讶
You're surprised.

362
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,069
你刚告诉我我得了癌症
You've just told me that I have cancer.

363
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,019
我当然很惊讶
Of course I'm surprised.

364
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,000
不  我告诉你你有个肿瘤
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

365
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,029
-你为什么那么害怕?  -我没有害怕
-Why are you scared?  -I'm not scared.

366
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,059
你为什么要害怕 Ben?
Why are you scared, Ben?

367
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,009
你说过在这座岛上没有人得过癌症
You said no one on this island ever had cancer.

368
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,089
-你告诉我...  -我知道我告诉你什么
-You told me that...  -I know what I told you.

369
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,039
你告诉我你能治好的
You told me you could fix it.

370
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,099
-你说你能治好我妹妹的 你骗了我  -不 我没骗你
-You said that you cured my sister.You lied to me.  -No,I did not lie to you.

371
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,030
如果你能治好癌症 你怎么会得上的呢?
If you can cure cancer, then why do you have it?

372
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,050
我不知道
I don't know.

373
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,039
我要和她谈谈 我要和Rachel谈谈
I wanna talk to her. I wanna talk to Rachel.

374
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,089
-我要和她谈谈 就现在!  -这是不可能的 Juliet
-I wanna talk to her now!  -That's not gonna happen, Juliet,

375
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,079
但我能保证 Rachel现在很好
but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.

376
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,079
-你没有治好她!  -不!
-You never cured her!  -I did!

377
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,069
-你是个骗子!  -不 Juliet
-You're a liar! -No, Juliet

378
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,079
你对我撒了谎!
You lied to me!

379
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
我告诉你的都是真的!
I told you the truth!

380
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,010
我保证过你
I gave you my word.

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,099
我想回家
I wanna go home.

382

我想回家 Ben 求你了
I wanna go home, Ben. Please.

383
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,000
你就不能让我走吗?
Can't you please just let me go home?

384
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,060
不行
No.

385
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,010
站在那儿别动!
Step away from the case!

386
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,030
-听我说Sayid  -退后
-Listen to me, Sayid...  -Step back.

387
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:11,032
都是些医疗用具 他们能救Claire
It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire.

388
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,024
Jack都知道的
Jack knows all about it.

389
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:14,099
Jack现在不在这儿吧?
Jack ain't here right now, is he?

390
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,088
我说的都是实话
I'm telling you the truth.

391
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:24,005
你说过你把一切都告诉我
You said earlier if you told me everything you knew,

392
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:26,015
我会杀了你的
I'd kill you.

393
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:29,079
现在我要来验证一下
I'm going to test the validity of that statement.

394
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,032
他的意思是 "谈谈"
He means, "talk."

395
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,082
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

396
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,097
那我们取消其他安排
We cleared our schedules.

397
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,063
我们有的是时间
We got all the time in the world.

398
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,048
有意思的是...
You know, it's interesting...

399
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,014
你们两成了这个营地的警察
that you two are now the camp's moral police.

400
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:54,049
我很好奇 Sayid
I'm curious, Sayid.

401
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,068
什么时候你才会
How long was it before

402
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,038
告诉海滩上的人
you told everyone on that beach

403
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,007
你这一辈子折磨过多少人?
exactly how many people you've tortured in your life?

404
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,096
他们知道Basra市的事吗?
Do they know about Basra?

405
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,011
我很确定你来
And I'm sure the first thing

406
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,065
这里的第一件事 James
you did when you got here, James,

407
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,067
是告诉大家
was to gather everyone in a circle

408
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,060
在你登机之前的那个夜晚
and tell them about the man you shot in cold blood

409
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,026
你是怎么冷血的杀害那个人的
the night before you got on the plane.

410
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,061
我们为何不跳过
So why don't we just skip the part

411
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:24,084
你们作为"正义先锋"的部分?
where you two pretend to be righteous?

412
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,081
我要及时把这些送到Claire身边
I'm taking that medication back to Claire,

413
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,017
你们要让我走
and you're gonna let me,

414
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:32,073
因为如果她得不到这些
because if she doesn't get it,

415
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:35,021
她会死的
she's gonna die.

416
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,071
难道你们还想手上沾
And the last thing

417
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:45,081
更多鲜血吗?
that either of you need right now is more blood on your hands.

418
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,076
Goodwin! Ethan 一定还有幸存者
Goodwin! Ethan, there may actually be survivors,

419
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:07,024
你们假装是他们的一员 一个受到惊吓的乘客
and you're one of'em... a passenger. You're in shock.

420
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,078
观察  注意 不要暴露身份
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

421
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:13,003
三天之内我要所有的乘客名单
I want lists in three days.

422
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,015
看来我已经退出读书俱乐部了
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

423
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:32,090

我们还有些时间 这很重要
We have some time. It's important.

00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:49,002
我们一起走走
Take a walk with me.

He never has his walkie on.

431
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,029
我们在这儿干什么?
What are we doing here?

432
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:08,093

436
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:23,007

Did you see it?

437
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:25,087
一架飞机从天而降 Mikhail
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

438
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,099
我们当然看见了
Of course we saw it.

439
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:29,036
有什么消息吗?
What do you have so far?

大西洋航空公司815航班 从悉尼起飞

Yesterday you called me a liar.

447
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:54,064
我很伤心
I was hurt by that.

我的上帝! 我的上帝!
Oh, my God.

452
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:31,024
我的上帝!
Oh, my God.

453
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,066
两年前
A little over two years ago,

454
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,044
令许多人惊讶的是
to everyone's surprise,

455
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:37,067
Rachel的癌症完全消失
Rachel's cancer went into complete remission.

456
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:43,053
不久以后  她生下了这个健康的小男孩
Shortly after, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

457
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,026
她为他取名叫Julian
His name is Julian.

458
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:56,038
好了  谢谢你 Richard
Okay, thank you, Richard.

459
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,057
你尽快回来
You'll want to get back here as soon as you can.

460
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:01,011
我们有些新客人
We may have some new visitors.

461
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:03,094
不不不!
Oh, god! No,

462
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:06,049
不!
no!

463
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:12,068
我不是骗子 Juliet
I'm not a liar, Juliet.

464
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,064
我想回家
I wanna go home.

465
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:17,024
我们的协议不是这样的
That's not our agreement.

466
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,021
你要待在这儿直到完成了你的使命
You need to stay here until your work is finished.

467
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:22,070
这不可能  孕妇不断的死亡
It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.

468
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,021
那我们就要找更多的母亲
Then we'll find more mothers.

469
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,045
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

470
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:30,037
也许那飞机上就有一个
Maybe there's even one on that plane.

471
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:47,000
等等 你在做什么?
Wait. What are you doing?

472
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,064
不准她碰Clarie  这都是她对Clarie的好事
She's not touching her. She's the one who did this to her.

473
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:52,059
-她能帮她Charlie  -谁说的? 她吗?你怎么能相信她?
-She can help her.  -Says who? her? How can you even trust her?

474
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,078
我相信她
I do trust her.

475
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:58,051
你相信我吗?
Do you trust me?

476
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,079
你相信我吗?
Do you trust me?

477
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:05,019
是的
Yeah.

478
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,053
几分钟就好了  好吗?
Just give us a couple minutes here, okay?

479
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,039
多久能起效?
How long before this takes effect?

480
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,035
几小时后就能得出结果
We should see results in a few hours.

481
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,045
Juliet...

482
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,018
如果这不管用的话
If this doesn't work,

483
00:37:22,018 --> 00:37:24,047
如果她出了什么事的话...
if something happens to her...

484
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:29,034
我就不会在保护你了
I'm not gonna be able to protect you anymore.

485
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:32,036
你只能靠自己了
You'll be on your own.

486
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:37,028
我已经是一人了 Jack
I'm already on my own, Jack.

487
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,057
发生什么事了?
What happened?

488
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:38,083
我拿了鞋帆布和毯子
I've got a tarp, couple of blankets,

489
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:41,022
还有枕头
airline pillows.

490
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,020
这不多
It's not much,

491
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,062
但...怎么也是起步了
but...it'll get you started.

492
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,095
Clarie醒了
Claire's awake.

493
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:58,005
那边有个斜坡 我们都去乘凉
There's a lean-to that we've been using for shade,

494
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,092
而且大家都同意
and everyone says that it'd be all right

495
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:03,000
你在那边扎营
if you set up camp there for now.

496
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:05,028
谢谢
Thank you.

497
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,049
他们都是好人
They're good people,

498
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,047
他们愿意补偿对你的怀疑
and they're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.

499
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:15,018
但他们还是需要一些答案
But eventually they're gonna need some answers.

500
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:19,024
为什么你不需要?
Why don't you?

501
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:24,013
你一直在说他们
You keep talking about them.

502
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,022
为什么我不需要对你做出解释呢?
why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?

503
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,077
你在那里
You were there.

504
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,096
当潜艇爆炸时
You were standing right next to me

505
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:38,067
你就在那里...
when that submarine exploded...

506
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:42,048
在那一刻 我从你的眼里看出
And in that moment, I saw it in your eyes.

507
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,024
你比任何一个人
You wanna get off this island

508
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:48,021
都更加想要离开这座岛
more than anything else in the world.

509
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,029
你也是我们的一员
That makes you one of us.

510
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:19,054
我们再回顾一下
Let's go over it again.

511
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:24,011
-我知道该怎么做  -我们再温习一遍 确保一下
-I know what to do.  -Let's go over it again,just to be sure.

512
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:26,067
我把Austen拖进丛林
I drag Austen out into the jungle,

513
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:29,025
然后把我和她拷在一起
handcuff myself to her,

514
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,078
然后告诉她我也和她一样被放了瓦斯弹
then tell her I was gassed just like she was.

515
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:34,099
-如果她发现你在撒谎呢?  -我会承认
-And if she catches you in the lie?  -I'll admit to it,

516
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,006
告诉她这是让她信任我的唯一方法
tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.

517
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,026
很好  然后呢?
Good. What then?

518
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,027
他们会把我带回海滩
They'll take me back to the beach.

519
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:55,034
我知道你想让我去那里
I know you want me to go there,

520
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:58,034
但在我们对他们做的所有事后
but after everything we've done to them,

521
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,090
这将是个问题
it's going to be a problem.

522
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,071
我们已经启动了Clarie体内的植入设备
We've activated the implant in Claire.

523
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:10,009
48小时内她会出现症状
She should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours.

524
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,071
等你到了营地
By the time you get to that camp,

525
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:15,084
你将要有个很大的危机要解决
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

526
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,068
我需要医疗用具
I'll need supplies.

527
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:20,095
Pryce已经在办了
Pryce is already on his way.

528
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:24,019
他会把箱子放在Ethan原来的藏身地点
He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop point.

529
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:27,082
告诉Jack你能救她
Tell Jack that you can save her.

530
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,095
她会信任你
He trusts you.

531
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,058
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

532
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,095
我很好
I'm fine.

533
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,069
一周后再见
See you in a week.
