我对为什么只有我们两个人回来并不感到兴奋
Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.

154
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:11,041
也许他们应该解释为什么 没来找我们
Well, maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us.

你要帮我们把它修好
You're gonna help us fix this thing.

262
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,026
我为什么要这样做?
And why in the hell would I do that?

263
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:36,065
因为里面有啤酒
'Cause there's beer.

264

他为什么说 "不要回来"?

他牺牲自己让我们逃走
He sacrificed himself so we could escape.

266
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,085
他全豁出去了
Probably didn't want it to be for nothing.

267
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:46,035
Hurley 告诉我们他们放了 Michael 和 Walt

你看见有其它船吗?
Did you see any other boats?

271
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:56,045
没有 但他们不会放弃自己唯一的船
No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.

272
00:19:57,037 --> 00:20:01,012
-他们可以离开这座岛吗?  -我不知道 John
-So they can leave the island?  -I don't know, John.

277
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,013
为什么?
Why?

278
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,043
那你就要自己去问 Sawyer 了
You're gonna have to ask Sawyer.

279
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:20,014
-Kate 你去哪儿?  -我不在乎Jack说什么
-Kate, where are you going?  -I don't care what Jack said.

280
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:24,014
我们必须把他找回来 我欠他的...
They've got him, and we have to get him back.I owe him that...

281
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,048
我要去找人帮忙

282
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,053
找谁?
Help from who?

他知道我们的爱 来自耶稣基督
He knows of my love for the savior,

286
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:51,033
所以他委托 Taxco 的艺术家为我雕刻这尊纯金的雕像
so he commissioned artisans in taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.

287
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,021
这闻起来像意大利面
Wow, that smells like great lasagna.

288
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:57,080
这是 Trons 一家自制的
The Trons made it themselves.

289
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:00,047
Hugo在Bennigan 找到他们的

现在他们是我们的管家
Now they are our butlers.

291
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:07,023
有什么不对吗 Hugo?
Something wrong, Hugo?

292
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:10,048
你父亲问你问题呢 Hugo
Your father asked you a question, Hugo.

293
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,074
我父亲?
My father?

294
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,098

295
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,024
都17年了
like he hasn't been gone for 17 years.

296
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,070
他就这么突然出现了?
And all of a sudden he shows up?

297
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,082
你难道就没有怀疑吗?
Aren't you at least a little suspicious?

298
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,037
我来是因为你母亲打电话 和我说你遇到了麻烦
I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.

299
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,029

All these numbers and curs.

301
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,008
Hugo 我已经无能为力了
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore.

302

你需要你父亲的影响
I thought you needed a manly influence,

他回来的唯一原因就是为了钱

你一直留着它
You saved it.

329
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:58,027
你一直留着它
you saved it.

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,088

这些回收物都怎么了?
What's up with all this recycling?

332
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,067

333
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,080
看来那些达摩疯子在建什么路
Looks like those dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road.

334

这又臭又跑了气

你能修好吗? 你知道哪里坏了?

那啤酒自从 "Rocky III" 就一直放在那儿了
Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before "Rocky III"

351
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,054
也许是"II" 那东西都有毒了 
maybe even "ii". It's probably poison by now.

352
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,066
这具骷髅似乎很喜欢
Skeletor seems to like it.

353
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,067
干杯
Bottoms up.

354
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,008
这不好笑 伙计
That's not cool, dude.

他也有妈妈 家庭和朋友
That guy had a mom, a family and friends.

他是达摩组织的看守
He was a dharma janitor.

359
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:09,028
那你也要尊重死者
Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.

360
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:13,069
你能修好吗?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.Can you fix it?

361
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,045
不 修不好了
No. No fix.

你就不能试一下吗? 我们要让它跑起来
I mean, can't you try, dude?I mean, we gotta get this running.

364
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:29,004
你别说了 他是对的 他说了"修不好的"
Hey, leave the man alone.He's right. "No fix".

365
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,008
看看这 它根本跑不起来
" Take a look at that mess.There's no way it's gonna get running.

00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,063
-你多傻啊?  -你有问题吗 伙计?
-How thick are you?  -What's your problem, man?

367
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:36,038
你为什么不希望它能跑起来?
Why--why don't you want this to work?

368
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,009
我才不关心 他对你这么重要?
I don't care if it works.Why is it so important to you?

369
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,001
因为我们都要有点希望
Because we could all use a little hope.

370
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,076
如果你在寻求希望的话 Ese
If it's hope you're looking for

371
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:45,015
我们在另一个岛上...

538
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:37,084
我们希望他回来 只是不知道去哪里找
not about the motivation,just about knowing where to look.

因为他们抓了我 肯定也不会放了我

如果我没逃出来的话 他们可能要杀了我
