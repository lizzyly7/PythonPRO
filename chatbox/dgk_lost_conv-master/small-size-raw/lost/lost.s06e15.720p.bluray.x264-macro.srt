1
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,170

你受伤了?

2
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,680

我来帮你吧

3
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,930

谢谢你

4
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,320

你叫什么名字?

5
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,820

我叫Claudia

6
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,980
真是个好名字
That's a lovely name.

7
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,290
这儿没别人了吗?
Where are the rest of your people?

8
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,890
就只有我一个
There's only me.

9
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,440
你怎么到这儿来的?
How did you get here?

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,900
和你一样...
The same way you got here...

11
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,540
纯属意外
By accident.

12
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,450
- 你来了多久... - 问题太多了
- How long have you... - Every question I answer

13
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,270
问完一个又一个
will simply lead to another question.

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,480
你应该好好休息 能活下来就是万幸
You should rest. Just be grateful you're alive.

15
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,220
- 我船上还有人呢 我得去... - 不
- There were other people on my ship. I need to go... - No.

16
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,410
如果岛上还有别人 我肯定能找到
If there are other people on the island, I will find them.

17
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,620
要生了吗?

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,550

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,940

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,520
就是这样
That's it.

22
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,270
用劲! 再加把劲!
Push! Push harder.

23
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,330
我生不下来!
I can't!

24
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,050
不 你可以的
Yes, you can.

25
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,180
就是这样!
That's good!

26
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,810
再加把劲
One more push.

27
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,760
哦! 哦!
Oh! Oh!

是个儿子哦
It's a boy.

29
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,260
名字我取好了 叫Jacob
His name is Jacob.

30
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,150
是个儿子呢
It's a boy.

31
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,420
我能不能...
Can I...

32
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,980
还有一个孩子
There's another baby.

33
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,820
啊!
Aah!

34
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,620
加把劲
Push again.

35
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,350
快出来了
Here it comes.

36
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,030
用劲啊!
Now!

37
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,860
哦!
Oh!

38
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,960
又是个儿子
It's another boy.

39
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,480
我只想好了一个名字
I only picked one name.

40
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,110
哦 嘘 嘘
Oh. Shh. Shh.

41
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
我能瞧瞧他么?
May I see him?

42
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,850
抱歉
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,310
啊!
Uhh!

44
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,370
啊!
Uhh!

45
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,900
啊! 啊!
Uhh! Uhh!

46
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:44,500

迷失 第6季第15集

47
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,080
这是什么?
What is it?

48
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,730
是个游戏棋
It's a game.

49
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,910
拿来玩的
You play it.

50
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,450
你怎么会玩呢?
How do you know how?

51
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,270
我就是会呗
I just know.

52
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,200
你能教我玩么?
Will you show me how to play?

53
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,230
如果你答应不告诉妈妈 我就教你玩
If you promise not to tell mother.

54
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,990
为什么不能告诉她?
Why can't we tell her?

55
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,220
因为她会把这东西没收掉
Because she'll take it away.

56
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,930
那... 你到底想不想玩 Jacob?
So... do you wanna play or don't you, Jacob?

57
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,140
嗯 我想玩
Yes. I wanna play.

58
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,800
你好 Jacob
Hello, Jacob.

59
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,740
你好 妈妈
Hello, mother.

60
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,120
你弟弟在哪儿?
Where's your brother?

61
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,700
他在海滩那边...
He's down at the beach...

62
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,550
眺望大海
staring out at the ocean.

63
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,120
需要我帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

64
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,070
如果你愿意的话 就帮我把那些线分开来
If you like, you can sort that.

65
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,570
你和弟弟到海滩那儿干嘛呢?
What were you and your brother doing down at the beach?

66
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,480
我们只是... 散散步而已
We were just... walking.

67
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,170
你爱我吗 Jacob?
Do you love me, Jacob?

68
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,820
爱
Yes.

69
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
那就把事实告诉我
Then tell me what happened.

70
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,770
我可以坐这儿吗?
May I join you?

71
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,890
当然可以
Sure.

72
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,650
Jacob把我找到的东西 告诉你了
Jacob told you what I found.

73
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,760
没错
Of course he did.

74
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,800
Jacob不会撒谎
Jacob doesn't know how to lie.

75
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,790
他可不像你这样
He's not like you.

76
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,530
什么意思? 我什么样儿?
Why? What am I like?

77
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,710
你...
You're...

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,630
很特别
special.

79
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,440
我能继续留着这个游戏棋么?
Can I keep the game?

80
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,420
当然可以
Of course you can.

81
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,380
所以我才把它给你啊
That's why I left it for you.

82
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,310
它是你的?
It came from you?

83
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,780
嗯 不然它还能是谁的?
Of course it did. Where else would it come from?

84
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,850
从大海那头的
From somewhere else.

85
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,360
某个地方飘过来的
Across the sea.

86
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,130
不可能的
There is nowhere else.

87
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,050
这个岛是唯一的陆地
The island is all there is.

88
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
那我们是从哪儿来的?
Then where did we come from?

89
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,390
你和你哥哥是我生的
You and your brother came from me,

90
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,580
我又是我妈妈生的
and I came from my mother.

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,130
那她在哪儿?
Where is she?

92
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,170
她去世了
She's dead.

93
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,980
什么叫"去世"?
What's "dead"?

94
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,110
这事 你永远不必担心
Something you will never have to worry about.

95
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,670
快! 它跑了!
Hurry up! He's getting away!

96
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,070
快藏起来!
Hide!

97
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,600
- 他们是谁? - 嘘!
- Who are they? - Shh!

98
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,560
妈妈!
Mother!

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,670
妈妈!
Mother!

100
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,290
怎么了?
What's wrong?

101
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,790
有人来了 我们看到几个男人
We saw people. Men.

102
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,360
- 他们有多少人? - 三个 他们杀了头野猪
- How many were there? - Three. They killed a boar.

103
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,630
他们看到你们了吗?
Did they see you?

104
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,640
没有
No.

105
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,850
我想没有吧
I don't think so.

106
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,390
他们从什么地方来的? 他们看起来跟我们好像
Where did they come from? They looked like us.

107
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,680
他们跟我们不一样
They're not like us.

108
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,800
他们不是这儿的
They don't belong here.

109
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,180
我们来这儿是有原因的
We are here for a reason.

110
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,030
什么原因?
What reason?

111
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,280
现在还不是说的时候
It's not time yet.

112
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,380
妈妈 是什么原因啊?
Mother, what reason?

113
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,510
跟我来
Come with me.

114
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,240
- 你认识这些人吗? - 认识
- Did you know about the people? - Yes.

115
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,270
你怎么没和我们提起过他们?
Why didn't you tell us about them?

116
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,620
因为他们很危险 我不想让你们担惊受怕
Because they're dangerous, and I didn't want to frighten you.

117
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,050
他们怎么就危险了呢?
What makes them dangerous?

118
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,880
所有人都因此而危险
The same thing that makes all men dangerous.

119
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,000
先来 后斗 接着毁灭 最后沦落
They come. They fight. They destroy. They corrupt.

120
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,490
结局总是相同的
And it always ends the same.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,760
- 他们"来"? 从哪儿来? - 从岛上的另一个地方来
- They "come"? Come from where? - Another part of the island.

122
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,310
你们千万不要去找他们
And you're never to go looking for them.

123
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,520
如果他们发现了你们 他们会伤害你们的
If they found you, they would hurt you.

124
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,790
他们会什么要伤害我们?
Why would they hurt us?

125
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,120
因为他们是人 Jacob 是人就会那么做
Because they're people, Jacob, and that's what people do.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,810
但我们也是人啊 照你这么说 我们也会互相伤害喽?
But we're people. Does that mean that we can hurt each other?

127
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,080
我不会让你们互相伤害的
I've made it so you can never hurt each other.

128
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

129
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,920
这就是我们来这儿的原因
This is the reason we're here.

130
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,700
不要进去
Don't go in there.

131
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,160
下面是什么东西?
What's down there?

132
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,260
光
Light.

133
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,890
最温暖
The warmest,

134
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,110
最明亮的光
brightest light

135
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,800
是你不曾看见或感觉过的
you've ever seen or felt.

136
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,730
我们必须确保没人能找到它
And we must make sure that no one ever finds it.

137
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,890
太美了
It's beautiful.

138
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,430
是啊
Yes, it is.

139
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,410
这就是他们想得到它的原因
And that's why they want it,

140
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,980
因为每个人的心中
because a little bit of this very same light

141
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,460
都有一点这种光
is inside of every man.

142
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,120
但是他们贪得无厌
But they always want more.

143
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,110
他们能拿得到吗?
Can they take it?

144
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,870
拿不到 但他们会去试
No, but they would try.

145
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,200
一旦试过 他们就会把它带出去
And if they tried, they could put it out.

146
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,130
如果光从这儿被带出去了...
And if the light goes out here...

147
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,660
那就会变得到处都是了
it goes out everywhere.

148
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,330
所以我守护着这个地方
And so I've protected this place,

149
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,650
但我无法永远守护这里
but I can't protect it forever.

150
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,850
那还有谁可以呢?
Then who will?

151
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,690
将会是你们中的一个
It will have to be one of you.

152
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,090
- 你不能这么走 Jacob - 为什么不能?
- You can't do that, Jacob. - Why not?

153
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,920
因为这是违反规则的
Because it's against the rules.

154
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,360
- 规则是你定的 - 这东西是我找到的
- You made the rules. - I found it.

155
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,410
哪天 你要是自己新创了一个游戏
One day, you can make up your own game,

156
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,270
那其他人都得按你定的规则来
and everyone else will have to follow your rules.

157
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,590
没关系
It's all right.

158
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,980
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

159
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,810
怎么了?
What?

160
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,840
怎么了?
What's wrong?

161
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,240
我去海滩上散会儿步
I'm going for a walk to the beach.

162
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,590
过会儿我来找你
I'll meet you late

163
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,000
你好
Hello.

164
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,750
Jacob为什么看不见你?
Why can't Jacob see you?

165
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,490
因为我已经死了
Because I'm dead.

166
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,530
想跟我来吗? 我给你看点儿东西
Will you come with me? I'd like to show you something.

167
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,020
给我看什么?
Show me what?

168
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,890
你的出生地
Where you came from.

169
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,650
在岛的另外一端... 你从来没见过的地方
It's across the island... a place you've never seen.

170
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,020
他们是谁?
Who are they?

171
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,050
13年前他们来到了这儿...
They came here 13 years ago...

172
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,710
就在你出生的前一天
The day before you were born.

173
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,970
他们的船在一场暴风中失事了
Their ship was wrecked in a storm.

174
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,810
船是什么东西?
Ship. What's that?

175
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,750
人们乘坐它 从一个地方去往另一个地方
It's a way for people to get from one place to another.

176
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,210
我们就是乘坐它漂洋过海的
It's how we came across the sea.

177
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,070
但海外并没有东西啊
But there's nothing across the sea.

178
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,830
海外有很多东西
There are many things across the sea.

179
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,970
你也是越洋而来的
You come from across the sea, too.

180
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,080
不 不是那样的
No. That's not true.

181
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,180
我妈妈不是这么跟我说的
That's not what my mother told me.

182
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,850
她不是你的妈妈
She's not your mother.

183
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,300
我才是
I am.

184
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,850
Jacob啊
Jacob.

185
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,110
Jacob 醒醒
Jacob, wake up.

186
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,290
跟我来
Come with me.

187
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,670
你为什么把你的东西都带在身上啊?
Why do you have all your things?

188
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,050
那是我们的东西
They're our things.

189
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,600
我带着它们 是因为我们要走了
I took them because we're leaving,

190
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,290
- 我们再也不回来了 - 什么?
- and we're never coming back. - What?

191
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,200
跟我走就是了
Just follow me.

192
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,440
跟你去哪儿?
Follow you where?

193
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,200
去他们那儿
To the people.

194
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,420
不 我们应该远离他们
No. We're supposed to stay away from them.

195
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,180
那是我们的人 Jacob 我们要和他们一起生活
They're our people, Jacob, and we're gonna live with them.

196
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,300
不 妈妈说...
No, mother said...

197
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,010
她骗你的 所有这些... 都是她骗你的
She lied. She lied about everything... all of it.

198
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,880
我知道你无法理解 但你必须得跟我我走
I know you don't understand, but you have to come with me.

199
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,100
- 我不想一个人去 - 不行 妈妈爱我们
- I don't want to go by myself. - We can't. Mother loves us.

200
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:41,970
- 她根本不爱我们 - 住口!
- She doesn't love us. - Stop!

201
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,330
- 这都是谎言! - 住口!
- It was all a lie! - Stop it!

202
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,370
- 她都根本不是我们的妈妈! - 啊!
- She's not even our mother! - Aah!

203
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,240
- 不是的! - Jacob!
- No! - Jacob!

204
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,600
- 你这是干什么? - 他要离开这里!
- What are you doing? - He's leaving!

205
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,450
他要去和他们在一起!
He's going to them!

206
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,150
和那些人一起!
To the other people!

207
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
什么?
What?

208
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,660
我都知道了
I know now.

209
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,210
海的那边还有一片天地
There is another place across the sea.

210
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,850
我是从那儿来的
It's where I'm from,

211
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,970
所以我要回到那儿去 我要回家
and I'm gonna go there. I'm gonna go home.

212
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,490
谁... 是谁告诉你这些的?
Who... who told you that?

213
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,240
我妈妈!
My mother!

214
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,800
我就是你妈妈
I'm your mother.

215
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,830
是你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother.

216
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,140
Jacob啊...
Jacob...

217
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,900
那也是你的母亲
She was your mother, too.

218
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,860
我们不属于这里 也不属于她
We don't belong here. We don't belong with her.

219
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,010
跟我一起走吧
Come with me.

220
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,850
我不走
No.

221
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
亲爱的 你得知道
My love, you need to know this.

222
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,600
无论你听说了什么
Whatever you have been told,

223
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,110
你永远都不能离开这座岛
you will never be able to leave this island.

224
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,990
我不信
That's not true.

225
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,520
总有一天 我会证明给你看的
And one day, I can prove it.

226
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,140
你认为他还会回来吗?
Do you think he'll come back?

227
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,210
不会
No.

228
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,640
他说 你杀了我们的妈妈
He said you killed our mother.

229
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,200
是真的吗?
Is that true?

230
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,560
没错
Yes.

231
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,990
如果我不杀她
If I had let her live,

232
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,570
她就会带着你们 回到她那儿去
she would have taken you back to her people,

233
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,130
那些人都是坏人 Jacob... 坏透了
and those people are bad, Jacob... very bad.

234
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,820
我... 我不能让你们和他们同流合污
I... I couldn't let you become one of them.

235
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,740
我要你们成为好人
I needed you to stay good.

236
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,330
我是好人吗 妈妈?
Am I good, mother?

237
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,590
是的 当然是
Yes. Of course you are.

238
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,850
那为什么你更爱他一些呢?
Then why do you love him more than me?

239
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,530
我爱你 只是... 方式不同
I love you in... in different ways.

240
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,720
你会待在我身边吗 Jacob?
Will you stay with me, Jacob?

241
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,790
求求你 好么?
Please?

242
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,590
好的
Yes.

243
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,120
暂时不会走
For a while.

244
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,480
你看这个怎么样?
What do you think?

245
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,190
很漂亮 Jacob
It's very nice, Jacob.

246
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,540
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

247
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,550
我只是有些累了
I'm just tired.

248
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,130
她知道你来看我吗?
She know you visit me?

249
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,840
她从来不问起你
She never asks about you.

250
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,300
那很遗憾 我问起了她
Then I'm sorry I asked about her.

251
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,900
你为什么来看我们 Jacob?
Why do you watch us, Jacob?

252
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,540
是因为 我想知道妈妈说得对不对
I watch because I wanna know if mother's right.

253
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,010
你说哪方面?
Right about what?

254
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,280
就是这些人
About them.

255
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,080
噢 你是说我的人
Oh, you mean my people.

256
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,550
你想知道他们是不是坏人
You wanna know if they're bad.

257
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,250
那女人大概疯了
That woman may be insane,

258
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,720
但这事她说对了
but she's most definitely right about that.

259
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,760
我不知道 他们好像对我还不错
I don't know. They don't seem so bad to me.

260
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,430
是啊 你不过是远观
Well, that's easy for you to say,

261
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,710
自然体会不深 但是相信我
looking down at us from above. Trust me.

262
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,800
我和他们生活有30年了
I've lived among them for 30 years.

263
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,280
他们贪婪 有控制欲 不值得信赖...
They're greedy, manipulative, untrustworthy...

264
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,810
而且 自私自利
and selfish.

265
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,500
那你为什么还和他们一起?
Then why are you with them?

266
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,860
因为我借助他们达到目的
They're a means to an end.

267
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,710
什么目的?
What end?

268
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,060
我要离开这里 Jacob
I'm leaving, Jacob.

269
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
- 我找到了离岛的方法 - 不 那是不可能的
- I found a way off the island. - No, it's impossible.

270
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,230
这个岛与世隔绝 无路可逃
There is no way off the island.

271
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,950
我的人中 不乏智者...
There are very smart men among us...

272
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,820
他们对金属为什么会被吸过去 很感兴趣
men who are curious about how things work.

273
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,080
于是我们一起 在岛上到处寻找
Together, we have discovered places all over this island

274
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,810
那些让金属发生奇怪反应的地方
where metal behaves strangely.

275
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,210
当我们找到一个这样的地方时
When we find one of these sites,

276
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,840
我们把它挖开了
we dig.

277
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,830
这一次 我们找到了些东西
And this time we found something.

278
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,960
跟我走吧 Jacob 走吧
Come with me, Jacob, please.

279
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,210
等她死了 你打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do when she dies?

280
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,310
她永远不会死的
She's never gonna die.

281
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,170
Jacob 任何东西都有消逝的一天
Jacob, everything dies.

282
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,640
我不想离开这座岛
Well I don't wanna leave this island.

283
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,430
这里是我的家
It's my home.

284
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,150
好吧 但这不是我家
Well, it's not mine.

285
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,480
你去哪了?
Where were you?

286
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,540
我去哪 你心知肚明
You know where I was.

287
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,710
他和你说了什么 Jacob?
What did he say to you, Jacob?

288
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,420
他说 他终于找到离开这座岛的方法了
He said he's finally found a way to leave the island.

289
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,240
可以和你聊聊吗?
May I join you?

290
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,330
好吧
Yes.

291
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,000
你还好吗?
How are you?

292
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,200
我很担忧
I'm worried.

293
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,570
妈妈 你是该担心
Well, mother, you should be.

294
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,750
我花了30年来找这个地方
I've spent 30 years searching for that place.

295
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,940
小时候 你带我去看过...
You brought me as a child...

296
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,260
那个... 会发出美丽光芒的瀑布
that... waterfall with that beautiful light.

297
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,450
我走遍了整座岛 从一端到另一端
I've walked this island from end to end,

298
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,060
但是 再没发现过那个地方
not once coming close to finding it.

299
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,380
后来我想到
But then I began to think,

300
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,970
要是那光埋藏在岛下呢...
what if the light underneath the island...

301
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,340
要是我可以从别的地方到那儿呢?
what if I could get to it from someplace else?

302
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,670
我花了很长时间 才找到去那儿的办法
Figuring out how to reach it took a very long time.

303
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,420
跟你在一起的那些人... 他们也看见了?
The people with you... they saw this, too?

304
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,780
对 他们想出了一些很有趣的点子
Yes. They have some very interesting ideas

305
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,710
来处理那道光
about what to do with it.

306
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,800
处理? 你根本就不知道...
Do with it? You don't have any idea wh...

307
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,260
我根本不知道 是因为你对我闭口不谈 母亲
I have no idea because you wouldn't tell me, mother.

308
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,290
这是什么?
What is that?

309
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,860
是个转轮
It's a wheel.

310
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,160
我们要弄个缺口...
We're going to make an opening...

311
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,080
一个比这个大得多的缺口
One much bigger than this one.

312
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,100
然后我要把那个转轮连到
And then I'm going to attach that wheel

313
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,600
我们正在建的一个系统上...
to a system we're building...

314
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,250
这个系统能够传输水和光
A system that channels the water and the light.

315
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,540
然后我要转动它
And then I'm going to turn it.

316

You're letting him go?

335

我别无选择 这是他想要的

会比死更糟 Jocab
It'd be worse than dying Jacob.
