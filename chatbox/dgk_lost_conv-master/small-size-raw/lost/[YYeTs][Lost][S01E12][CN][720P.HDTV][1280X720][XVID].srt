跟踪你? 我是在保护你
Stalking you? I was protecting you.

真不敢相信
I can't believe you.

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,077
还没那么糟
It's not that bad.

12
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:13,073
这是我的膝盖  我说多糟就有多糟
It's my knee. I'll tell you how bad it is.

13
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,011
不管怎样  先问你 
What the hell

14
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,011
你在这周围晃来晃去干什么呢?
are you doing all the way out here,anyway?

大伙们吃的很多
Everyone's been eating a lot.

16
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,034
这是唯一一个树上的 果子没被摘光的地方
This is the only place the trees aren't picked clean.

17
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,054
是 但你不应该一个人来这儿 都发生那样的事了
You shouldn't be here alone, not after...

18
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:26,049
我不会有事的  我会管好我自己
No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.

19
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,067
当然 "我不需要保护 我能管好我自己
Oh, of course. "I don't need protecting.I can take care of myself.

怎么了 又闻到血腥味了?
What, you smell blood on the wind?

23
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:38,074
你没听到吗?
You don't hear that?

24
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,012
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

25
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,054

27
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,060
经历了岛上这么多事
After all we've been through on this damn island,

28
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,052
难道还不应该好好享受一番?
don't we deserve something good?

29
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:13,081
什么 你不愿来?
What, you're gonna say no?

30
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,055
你是那种眼光短浅 
Are you some sort of navel-gazing, no-fun, mopey type?

31
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,055
毫无乐趣 极度无聊的那类人?
no-fun, mopey type?

32
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,075

43
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,068
Sawyer!

44
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:35,003
我给自己弄到一只钱包

00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,040
-你真令人作呕  -他不会想念它了

46
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:40,060
帮我把那只箱子弄上来
Help me with that case.

47
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,078
我令人作呕  你就不了?
Oh, I'm disgusting, but you're not?

48
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,087
那本来就是我的
It's mine.

49
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,016
不会钥匙还在你身上吧?
You wouldn't happen to have your key on you, would you?

50
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,067
这箱子不是你的 对吧?
That case ain't yours, is it?

51
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,080
不对
No.

52
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:51,059
好吧...
Well.

53
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,024
你不会介意的吧 如果我把它...
You wouldn't mind if I just...

54
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,055
拿走
Take it.

55
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,070
我不在乎
I don't care.

56
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,076
事情看起来并非这样
That's not what it looks like.

57
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:14,026
关于这箱子 你有什么要说的吗 雀斑女?
Something you want to tell me about this suitcase?

58
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:22,067
拿走吧
Take it.

59
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,051
东西都快被冲光了!
Everything is washing out to sea!

60
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,092
太不正常了
This can't be normal.

61
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,030
潮水来得如此突然...
The tide shifting so suddenly.

62
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,093
在这么短的时间里涨得这么高
Rising in so short a time.

63
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,019
这儿不正常的事情多着呢
There's a lot not normal around here.

64
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:01,003
按照这海滩被冲蚀的程度
The rate this beach is eroding,

65
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,024
机身得在水下呆好几天
the fuselage is going to be underwater in days.

66
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,012
黄昏前 我们得把所有东西从海滩搬走
We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall.

67
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:10,022
我只希望海岸的上升会带来些变化
I hope moving up the coast will make a difference.

68
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:12,060
如果大伙都搬到内地去 事情是肯定会有变化的
It'd make a difference if everyone moved inland.

69
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,018
我想你会发现 以后人们进丛林会很谨慎的
I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle

70
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,022
孕妇发生了这样的事
after what happened to the pregnant girl,

71
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,087
更不用说那东西了
not to mention whatever that thing is.

72
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,011
Sayid...

73
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:28,012
我要你把那个法国女子Rousseau带过来
I need you to take me back to the French woman, Rousseau.

74
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,043
Claire还在某人手上
Claire's still out there.

75
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,067
而Rousseau提到过岛上还有...
Now, Rousseau mentioned that there are...

76
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,002
...其他人
...others on this island.

77
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,071
-她精神失常了  -你自己听到她这么说了
-Her mind is gone.  -You heard them.

78
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,063
-我不知道我听到了什么  -你说你....
-I don't know.  -You said that you...

79
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:41,053
风 Jack 是风玩的小把戏
The wind. It was the wind playing tricks.

80
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,088
好吧 那你从她那儿带回来的那些纸怎么说?
Then what about the papers that you took from her then?

81
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:48,068
那些文件 地图...我是说 有什么我们可以...
Documents, maps. Isn't there...

82
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,042
我擅长计算和解码
I'm skilled at mathematics,

83
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,013
但这些等式我还从没看到过
but these are beyond anything I've ever seen.

84
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,047
地图和图表上有一些法文注解
There are these notes in French accompanying the maps and diagrams.

85
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,004
如果我能够把它们翻译过来的话
If I could translate them,

86
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,029
或许就能够搞明白很多事情 但...
I might be able to make sense of it, but...

87
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,030
怎么?
What?

88
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:06,048
也许有些东西还是不要翻译的好
Perhaps some things are best left untranslated.

89
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,040
是吗?
Yeah?

90
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,016
或许你应该过去和他聊聊那事
Maybe you should tell him that.

91
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,079
很高兴看到你在干一些比较有"建设性"的事情
You're doing something productive.

92
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,077
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

93
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,090
"我去哪了" 什么意思?
What do you mean?

94
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,097
过去的四天里  你和Locke在太阳上升之前就离开了
You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise

95
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,022
到天黑才回来
and coming back after dark.

96
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,055
你们在干什么?
What are you doing out there?

97
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,001
他是你新认识的男朋友?
Is he your new boyfriend?

98
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,067
我们在找Claire
We're looking for Claire.

99
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,077
我知道已经没有线索了 没人知道该去哪儿找
I thought there was no trail, that no one knew where to look.

100
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:52,049
哦 是的 但至少我们在做一件事
Yeah, at least I'm doing something.

101
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,040
你没看到大伙是怎么看我们的吗?
Don't you see the way they look at us?

102
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,076
他们都没认真的看我们 我们只是个笑话而已
We're a joke.

103
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,003
我正努力给大家作贡献
I'm trying to contribute something.

104
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,059
而你...你一点用都没有
And you're just... you're useless.

105
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:45,017
好 Ryan小姐  请把身份证给我
Okay, Miss Ryan, if you'll just give me some ID,

去工作
My work.

110
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,047
什么样的工作?
What line of work is that?

111

我是个摄影师
I'm a photographer.

112
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,070

但我想  你喜欢在上面

也许你根本就不是冲着那只箱子来的
Maybe you're not here for the case at all.

144
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,063
女人
Ow! Woman!

151
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,065
我有件事要问你
There was a matter I was going to ask you about.

152
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,062
什么?
What?

153
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:02,051
我需要你的帮助
I need a favor.

154
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,068
我要你帮我翻译一些我从 Rousseau那儿带回来的文件
I need your help translating papers I took from Rousseau

155
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,088
-Rousseau是谁?  -那个法国女子
-Who's Rousseau?  -The Frenchwoman.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,086
我们收到求救信号的那个人
The distress call we intercepted.

157
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,071
我老哥叫你来的?
Did my brother put you up to this?

158
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,065
你老哥?
Your brother?

159
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:26,065
不
No.

160
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:32,001
这些文件有一些用法语注解的等式
The papers contain equations with notations in French.

161
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,060
如果我能搞懂这些等式的含义
If I can understand the notations...

162
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,089
抱歉 我做不了
Sorry, I can't do it.

163
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,073
但你是岛上唯一一个会说法语的人
You're the only person who speaks French.

164
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,034
-我几乎不会说法语  -拜托了 Shannon
-I barely speak French.  -Please, Shannon.

165
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,040
能不能至少试一下?
Can you at least try?

166
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:54,008
混帐
Son of a bitch.

167
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:55,074
你在浪费时间 老兄
You're wasting your time, man.

168
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,034
如果你能打开这把锁
If you pick the lock on a Halliburton,

169
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,051
我就背你飞会洛山矶
I'll put you on my back and fly.

170
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,066
你先给自己找好飞机跑道吧 老爹
You better find yourself a runway, daddy,

171
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,099
因为没有我打不开的锁
'cause there ain't a lock I can't pick.

172
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,065
他要干什么?
What's he trying to do?

173
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,023
打开这把锁?!
Pick the lock on a Halliburton.

174
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,009
祝你好运吧
Good luck.

175
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:17,091
要打开这箱子 只能纯粹靠力 老兄
The only way you're gonna open that case is with pure force,

176
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,093
靠冲击速度
impact velocity.

177
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,033
什么意思?
What's that mean?

178
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:26,034
你得用一些坚硬的物质击打它 比如大锤 斧头
You gotta hit it with something hard like a sledgehammer. Or the axe.

179
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,034
拿到了
You got it.

180
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,042
是的 拿着
Yeah. Right there.

181
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,083
去那儿有没什么近路?
Isn't there an easier way to get there?

182
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:48,089
近路不一定好
The easiest way isn't always the best.

183
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,021
有没有人看到你拿这东西?
Did anybody see you take it?

184
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:54,008
没有 我想应该没有
No. I don't think so.

185
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,023
-到底有没有?  -什么?
-Well, which is it?  -Sorry?

186
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,036
是"没有"  还是"我想没有"?
"No," or "I don't think so"?

187
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,023
没有
No.

188
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,094
很好 开始工作吧
Good. Let's get to work.

189
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,081
你好啊  Charlie
Hello, Charlie.

190
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:19,076
对了 这些天你不怎么说话
Oh, that's right. You're not talking much these days.

191
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,050
但这并不意味着你得变的无礼啊
But it doesn't mean you get to be rude.

192
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,033
你说什么?
Excuse me?

193
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:31,073
大伙都在帮忙把营地般得高一些 除了你
Everybody else is helping us move the camp up the beach, except for you.

194
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,085
真的 假的?
Are you serious?

195
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:36,069
你以为岛上只有你一个人有事情伤心吗?
You think you're the only one with something to be sad about?

196
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,057
孩子 我有更加另人伤心的故事要讲给你听
I got sob stories for you,

197
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:41,043
所以你能不能帮我抬另一头?
so why don't you grab the other end of this thing and help me?

198
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,045
好吗?
Well?

199
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:02,017
快
Come on.

200
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,043
快
Come on.

201
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:23,079
冲击速度...
Impact velocity...

202
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,005
物理学!吃我屁弹
Physics, my ass.

203
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,009
好吧
All right.

204
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,012
混...
Son of a...

205
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,096
难以置信
Unbelievable.

206
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,066
你别想拿走
Don't even think about it.

207
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,077
该死的 雀斑女 我知道你想要
Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it.

208
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,012
没想到你这么想要这东西
I just didn't know how bad.

209
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,029
你就不能来点新招 啊!
You're gonna have to come up with a new move. Ah!

210
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,010
老天
God.

211
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,096
行了!好了 这么做太傻了
Okay! Okay, this is just silly.

212
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,018
等等
Hold on.

213
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,051
我有个建议...
I got a proposition for you.

214
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,058
你告诉我里面什么东西 我就把它给你
You tell me what's inside, and I'll give it to you.

215
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,053
你说真的?
Are you serious?

216
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,090
当然 我又打不开这箱子
Hell, no way to open the damn thing.

217
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:54,017
此刻 我关心的就是满足一下我的好奇心
At this point, all I care about is satisfying my own curiosity.

218
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,094
放松 宝贝儿
Oh! Easy, sweetheart.

219
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,082
我才不管里面什么东西
I don't really care what it is.

220
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:04,078
让我极度感兴趣的是 为什么这对你这么重要
What's burning me up is why it means so much to you.

221
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,051
最后一个机会
Last chance.

222
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,097
好吧
All right.

223
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,009
把钥匙给我
Give me the key now.

224
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,048
我已经问得烦了
I'm tired of asking nice.

225
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,091
把钱库的钥匙给我
Give me the money cage key now.

226
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:33,044
反正你会杀了我 我为什么要给你...
You're going to kill me. Why would I...

227
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,081
你以为我们是来谈判的啊?
You think we're having a conversation here? Huh?

228
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,006
大家给我安静!想回家吗?
Everybody be cool! Do you wanna go home?

229
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,071
别看着我!看着地板!
Don't look at me! Look at the floor!

230
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,027
大家不要慌 都给我趴好了
Everybody calm. Stay down.

231
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:44,076
听着 我不会再问你了 我要那把钥匙!
Listen to me, I am not gonna ask you again. I want that key!

232
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,058
-我可以制服他  -什么?
-I can take him.  -What?

233
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,069
那个高个子 他没看着我们 我可以把他拿下
The tall guy, he's not watching us.

234
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,015
只能趁现在 否则没机会 把头低下
It's now or never. Keep your head down.

235
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,099
小心!
Hey! Watch out!

236
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,022
拣起来!
Pick it up!

237
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,035
拣起来!  打他!  打他!
Pick it up! Shoot him!

238
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,070
你怎么回事?  开枪!
What's wrong? Shoot!

239
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,059
掩护!
Cover him!

240
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,079
打他!  打他!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

241
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,000
拉下保险销!
Turn off the safety!

242
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,024
把枪给我!
Gimme that.

243
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,075
在另一边!  拉下保险销!
It's on the side! Turn it off!

244
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,067
我不知道怎么使用枪!
I don't know how to use a gun!

245
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,085
你要吃子弹吗 肥仔?  恩?
You wanna get shot, fat boy? Huh?

246
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:25,038
-好 小英雄  -别 求你 别
-Okay, hero.  -No, please, don't.

247
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:29,079
闭嘴!让我们俩谈谈 恩?  里面 走!
Shut up! Let's you and me go talk. Huh? Right in here. Let's go.

248
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,033
"我不知道怎么用枪"?
"I don't know how to use a gun"?

249
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:44,021
-太经典了  -是的
-That's classic.  -Yeah.

250
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,089
你从没提到过数学
You never said anything about math.

251
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,026
你管法语 我管数学
You worry about the French. I'll take care of the math.

252
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,080
我做不了
I can't do this.

253
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:23,038
如果你能集中精力去做 我知道你行的 Shannon
If you really put your mind to it, I know you can.

254
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,094
你哪儿学的法语?
Where did you learn to speak French?

255
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:31,008
我认识这个家伙
I knew this guy.

256
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,075
这个家伙?
This guy?

257
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:39,066
在法国的St. Tropez  我在那儿住了一段时间
In France, in St. Tropez. I kind of lived there for a while.

258
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,062
他们说这是学外语最好的一种方法
Well, they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language.

259
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,061
好吧
All right.

260
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:56,011
我看看
Let me see.

261
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:01,088
那么...
So...

262
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,073
这是什么  这是干什么用的?
What is this? What is it for?

263
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,041
头疼
A headache.

264
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,038
酷
Oh. Cool.

265
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:22,001
好吧
All right.

266
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,040
Jack

267
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,043
我们遇到个问题
We got a problem.

268
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:30,040
我们遇到了问题 还是...
We have a problem, or...

269
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,006
你遇到了问题?
...you have a problem?

270
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:42,074
Jack 你是唯一一个了解我的人
Jack, you're the only one who knows about me.

271
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:49,091
在我离开去悉尼之前
Before I left for Sydney,

272
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:53,005
押送我的那位长官有只银色的箱子
the marshal who was escorting me, he had this silver case.

273
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:55,096
航空局不让他把箱子带到飞机上
The airline wouldn't let him bring it on the plane.

274
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,064
说服他们允许他带枪已经很困难了
It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun.

275
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:01,074
但那只箱子...他们还是允许他带上飞机了
But the case, they made him check it.

276
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:03,091
箱子里有什么东西?
What was in the case?

277
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,021
一些旅行经费 还有他的一些私人物品
Some traveling money. Some of his personal stuff.

278
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,045
还有一把4.9毫米 和一些弹药
And four 9 millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.

279
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,008
枪
Guns.

280
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:25,054
那么 箱子现在在哪?
So, where is the case now?

281
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:26,098
Sawyer拿去了
Sawyer has it.

282
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:30,019
到现在为止 他还没打开 但...
He hasn't been able to open it.

283
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,005
-我俩走运  -他会的
-Lucky for us.  -He will.

284
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,069
迟早的事
Sooner or later.

285
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,089
那么 你要我怎么做?
So, what do you need me to do?

286
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:42,060
我知道钥匙在哪
I know where the key is.

287
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:49,028
他...长官把它放皮夹里了 皮夹在他后面那只口袋里
He... The marshal kept it in his wallet, in his back pocket.

288
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:53,053
我已经把他埋了 Kate
I buried him, Kate.

289
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,049
我知道
I know.

290
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,035
埋哪了?
Where?

291
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,094
告诉我箱子里还有什么?
So, what else is in the case?

292
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,055
箱子里还有其他什么东西 Kate?
What else is in the case?

293
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,020
你说的是实话?
That's the truth?

294
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:15,093
就是些枪
Just the guns.

295
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:28,075
如果你要我帮你 我们得一块儿打开那箱子
If you want my help, we're gonna open the case together.

296
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:31,089
好
Okay.

297
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,065
好
Okay.

298
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,041
你笑什么?
Why are you smiling?

299
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,070
我在笑吗?
Am I?

300
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,013
你看起来很开心
You look happy.

301
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,082
我想你说对了
Well, I guess I must be then.

302
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,091
没理由好开心的 事情糟透了
There's no reason. Things are awful.

303
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,029
-还没那么糟  -我们被困在岛上
-They're not awful.  -We're stranded on an island.

304
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,056
-没人来救我们  -说不定呢
-No one's coming for us.  -You don't know that.

305
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:01,097
据我所知 丛林里有个爱吃人的东西
Well, what I do know is there's something in that jungle that eats people.

306
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:04,011
虽然我们好几周没听到它叫了
Just because we've not heard from it

307
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:05,083
但别以为它就不会肚子饿
doesn't mean it won't get hungry again.

308
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:10,079
我还知道有人要伤害我们
And I know there's a person or people that are trying to hurt us.

309
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,083
-Charlie  -还有...
-Charlie.  -And...

310
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:16,069
-没人责怪你  -什么?
-Nobody blames you.  -What?

311
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,058
对于Claire发生的事...
For what happened to Claire.

312
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:20,076
这并不是你的错
It's not your fault.

313
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:23,074
你能做的你都做了
You did everything that you could do,

314
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,079
还差点陪了命
and you came very close to dying yourself.

315
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,043
是
Yeah.

316
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,011
也许我还是死掉比较好
Maybe I should have died.

317
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,062
你知道我在想什么吗  Charlie?
You know what I think, Charlie?

318
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:43,038
你需要帮助
You need to ask for help.

319
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:46,005
谁会来帮我?
Who's gonna help me?

320
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:53,004
在你熔烧机身的时候
So why didn't you put him with the others?

321
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,005
你为什么不把他和其他人放在一起烧掉?
When you burned the fuselage?

322
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,059
因为我得埋了他
Because I needed to bury him.

323
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,041
你准备这么做了?
So you ready to do this?

324
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:19,054
是的 到现在为止 他们都已经胡思乱想了
Hell, yeah. By now their imaginations are running wild.

325
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:20,052
不要再隐瞒了
Don't hold back.

326
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,065
说出来的话他就不会告诉你了
He won't talk if the details are off.

327
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,032
你以及你的细节 Maggie
You and your details, Maggie.

328
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:31,021
-好吧 英雄...  -别 求你 不要
-Okay, hero.  -No, please, don't.

329
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,026
闭嘴!
Shut up!

330
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:34,065
大家放松!
Everybody just relax!

331
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:37,000
我说大家安静
I said quiet.

332
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:40,012
好 经理先生 你还是不肯说是吧?
Okay, Mr. Manager, you want to be a hard-ass?

333
00:26:40,037 --> 00:26:42,056
保护一个不属于你的钱库?
Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you?

334
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,093
好吧 得给点颜色瞧瞧了
Okay. There's gonna be consequences.

335
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,067
他会杀了我的
He's gonna kill me anyway.

336
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,072
我对天发誓 如果你再不闭嘴...
I swear, if you don't shut up.

337
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:54,042
给你三秒钟考虑时间把钥匙给我
You got three seconds to give me that damn key.

338
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:55,082
1...
One...

339
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,083
2...
Two...

340
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,046
3.
Three.

341
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,049
好吧
All right.

342
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,041
我给你
I'll give it to you.

343
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,089
很好 我们走
Good. Let's go.

344
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:08,041
呆在这边
Right around here.

345
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:10,000
我们走
Let's go.

346
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:37,014
-你没事吧?  -相对什么而言?
-You all right?  -Compared to what?

347
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:40,054
-你要我...  -不 我来
-You want me to...  -No. I'll do it.

348
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,050
哦  天
Oh, God.

349
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,097
-拿到了吗?  -是的
-Did you get it?  -Yeah.

350
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,003
钥匙不在里面
The key isn't in here.

351
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,047
没在?
It isn't?

352
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,055
不过 用钱包这招来骗我 你还真行
That was real good sleight of hand distracting me with the wallet.

353
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:37,048
松开
Open it.

354
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,071
-Jack...  -不要
-Jack...  -Don't.

355
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,073
不要
Don't.

356
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,003
"海...发光..."?  不 等等 不..
"The sea of sparkles?" No, wait. Um...

357
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:16,007
"改变着的散着银光的海洋"
"The sea of silver sparkles that change."

358
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,037
和最后一句一样
It's the same as the last one.

359
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,040
你确定?
Are you sure?

360
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:24,084
等式完全不同 这毫无关联
The equation is different. It doesn't relate.

361
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,090
你说得一点道理都没有
What you're saying doesn't make any sense.

362
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,034
好吧
Okay.

363
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,019
这个怎么说?
What about this one?

364
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,060
这应该是关于纬度和经度的
It should say something about latitude.

365
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,048
一些和星星有关的东西
Something about the stars.

366
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,015
好 给我一点思考空间 行吗?
Give me some room.

367
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:43,068
"靠近池塘...蓝色..."
"Next to the pond... blue..."

368
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,008
 "蓝色水泥板--蓝色永恒"
Uh..."Blue eternity."

369
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,099
不 等等 不 呃.. "蓝色..无穷"
No, wait, no. Um, "Blue infinity."

370
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:51,093
"蓝色..无穷"
"Blue infinity."

371
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,062
感觉有什么东西很熟悉
There's something about this that is so familiar.

372
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,076
过去的一小时 你跟我
You've been telling me

373
00:29:58,077 --> 00:30:00,032
说的几乎是一堆废话
what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour,

374
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,017
现在又说很熟悉?
and now it seems familiar?

375
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:06,033
好 A: 我告诉过你我的法语糟透了
Okay, A: I told you that my French sucks.

376
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,072
B: 我没有胡说 行了吗?
And B: This isn't my nonsense, okay?

377
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:13,024
你有没想过  在这个神秘的岛上呆16年后
Do you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island,

378
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,092
你朋友还会不适应吗?
your friend might not be quite adjusted?

379
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:20,085
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

380
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:27,030
是啊 你是不是听说了我很没用啊?!
Yeah. Haven't you heard? I'm completely useless.

381
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,049
Sawyer?

382
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:42,041
医生
Doctor.

383
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:47,004
有什么我能效劳的?
So, what can I do you for?

384
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:53,017
我就知道她会叫你来干这个苦活
Figured she'd get you to do her dirty work for her.

385
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:57,029
那么 怎么说 摔交决胜负?
So, what? We gonna wrestle for it?

386
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,086
不 你会把它给我的
No, you're gonna give it to me.

387
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:01,024
-是吗?  -是的
-Am I?  -Yeah.

388
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,009
我会把它给你?
I'm just gonna give it to you?

389
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:04,060
是的
Yeah.

390
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:06,062
我为什么会这么做?
Why would I want to do that?

391
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:07,092
头孢氨苄
Cephalexin.

392
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:11,007
哦?继续说
Yeah? Go on.

393
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:14,070
那是我给你用来治疗臂伤的抗生素
That's the antibiotic I'm giving you for the knife wound in your arm.

394
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:16,076
你还在治疗周期里
You're in the middle of a cycle.

395
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,042
现在 如果我继续给你药
If I keep giving you the pills,

396
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,008
你的病情会好转很快
you're gonna be as right as rain.

397
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:24,019
但如果我不给你药
But I'm gonna stop giving you the pills.

398
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,037
头两天 你会觉得你还不错
For two days you're gonna think you're all good.

399
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:30,021
然后伤口会开始发痒
Then it's gonna start to itch.

400
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,055
这以后 马上就伴有高烧
The day after, the fever will come

401
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:35,058
然后你就会发现手臂上下全是红条纹
and you'll see red lines running up and down your arm.

402
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:37,001
这之后不用一两天
Day or two after that...

403
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:40,019
你会求我把箱子拿走
...you'll beg me to take the case

404
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,015
还有求我把你的胳膊切掉
just to cut off your arm.

405
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,019
故事编得真好听 Jack
That's a nice story, Jack.

406
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:48,007
即使你说得都是真的
And even if it were true,

407
00:31:49,044 --> 00:31:51,013
我也不相信你会这么做
I don't think you could do it.

408
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,066
你错了
You're wrong.

409
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,047
她告诉你里面有什么了?
She tell you what's inside?

410
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,044
是的 也没告诉我
Yeah, me neither.

411
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,067
希望你能在"山洞镇"挽回几条生命
Hope you got yourself some jaws of life back in Cave Town.

412
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,084
因为要搞清楚这娘们的事必须得这么做
That's what it's gonna take to pop this bitch.

413
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,030
我会想办法的
I'll figure something out.

414
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,008
我知道你认为你在帮她的忙
I know you think you're doing her a favor,

415
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,024
但不管她怎么跟你解释这件事
but however she talked you into doing this,

416
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,088
她一定在说谎 老兄
she lied, brother.

417
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:52,041
Jack?

418
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,003
我们得一起打开
We're gonna do this together.

419
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:56,052
为什么?
Why?

420
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,032
因为我说过我们要一起打开
Because that's what I said we'd do.

421
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,004
你还在等什么?
What are you waiting for?

422
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:08,034
快打开这该死的门!
Open the damn thing!

423
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:12,005
现在我们说了算 不要乱动
Hell, now we're talking. Don't move.

424
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,091
-不要 我...  -闭嘴
-Please don't. I...  -Shut up.

425
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,042
我让你们进来了 现在可以放女孩走了吧
I let you in. Now please let the girl go.

426
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:32,026
放女孩走?
Let the girl go?

427
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:36,017
老兄 你还不知道吧?
Man, you have no idea, do you?

428
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:39,085
设你圈套的就是这个女孩
The girl is the one who set you up.

429
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:42,036
这女孩选了这个银行
The girl picked this bank.

430
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,078
选了这个金库
Picked this vault.

431
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,091
整件事都是女孩的主意
This whole thing is the girl's idea.

432
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:52,038
-你要干什么?  -放松 Maggie
-What are you doing?  -Easy, Maggie.

433
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:54,081
装钱就是了
Just cleaning up after myself.

434
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,066
你开枪 我也开枪
You shoot, I shoot.

435
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:05,027
等等 什么?
Wait. What?

436
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:07,006
我说过了 别伤害任何人
I said no one gets hurt.

437
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:09,086
我知道你很冷漠 宝贝
I know you're cold, baby.

438
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,015
但你还不至于那么冷漠
But you're not that cold.

439
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,019
这他妈发生什么事了?
What the hell is going on here?

440
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,076
你向我开枪 你这狗娘们!
You shot me, you stupid bitch!

441
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,090
闭嘴  Jason
Shut up, Jason.

442
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,013
我告诉过你不要信任她!
I told you not to trust her!

443
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,085
我要850号保险柜的钥匙
I need the key to safety deposit box 850 now.

444
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:28,079
你是谁?
Who are you?

445
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:30,088
给我保险柜的钥匙
The key to the box now.

446
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:33,081
你要有两把钥匙才行...银行的  还有...
You need two keys, the bank's and...

447
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:35,046
既然你有顾客的钥匙 你为什么还要...
If you had the customer key, why...

448
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,091
我未被授权的
I'm not on the signatory card.

449
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,011
你唆使我这么做 就为了只保险柜?
You put me up to this to get into a safe deposit box?

450
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,015
我对天发誓 你最好杀了我  Maggie 因为如果你不...
I swear to God, you better kill me, 'cause if you don't...

451

我名字不叫Maggie 走吧
My name's not Maggie. Now go.

452
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:01,079
有什么要说的吗?
Anything you want to tell me?

453
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,083
