They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.

152
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,088
那他们为什么没有开枪了
Well, why did they stop shooting?

153
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:43,076
那是Claire的房子吗  Claire在那儿
Was that claire's house? claire was there.

154
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,095
Hugo  不要抱着孩子站窗户边
Hugo, get the baby away from the window.

155
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,070
把他抱到里屋去
Put him in the back room.

156
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:54,032
你说我得活下来  为什么
You said I need to survive this. why?

157
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,028
因为现在只有一个人能帮我们了
Because there's only one person that can help us now,

158
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,076
那就是Jacob  我们得一起去找他
And that's jacob, and we have to go to him together.

159
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,091
你怎么认为我能找到他
What makes you think I can find him?

160
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,084
我甚至都不知道他的住处
I-i don't even know where the cabin is.

161
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,081
我明白  但Hurley知道
I know, but hurley does.

162
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,053
Claire!
Claire!

163
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,034
Claire
Claire!

164
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:11,074
Claire
Claire!

165
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,080
Claire

166
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,091
你没事吧
Are you okay?

167
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,072
Claire
Charlie?

168
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,092
没事  没事  Aaron在哪里  Aaron在哪里
Okay. okay. okay. where's aaron? where's aaron?

169
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,064
他跟我们在一起  好了  我们得走了
He's with us. it's okay. we're gonna move now.

170
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,009
我们走
Let's go.

171
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,068
把前门开了
Open the front door!

172
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,034
Hugo  不要那样
Hugo, you don't want to do that.

173
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,086
把该死的门打开
Open the damn door!

174
00:14:58,051 --> 00:14:59,063
开门
Open the door!

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,090
他妈的开门啊
Open the damn door!

176
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,024
小心
Careful.

177
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,036
她没事吧
Is she all right?

178
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,054
她晕过去了  不过应该没事
She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.

179
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,081
他们开始开枪了  为什么
They just started shooting. why?

180
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:28,098
为什么这些人要毫无目的地滥杀无辜
Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?

181
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:31,009
他们只是用滥杀无辜来激怒你  James
Those people were murdered to make you angry, james.

182
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,045
这样你就更有可能陷入狂暴
So you'd be more likely to come storming in here

183
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,037
-然后把我扔向虎口  -这有什么不好的
And throw me to the wolves. yeah, what's wrong with that?

184
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,098
我听来是个不错的计划  你觉得呢
Sounds like a great plan to me. what do you say, on three?

185
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,007
如果我是你  我就不会
I wouldn't if I were you.

186
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,005
闭嘴
Shut up!

187
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,009
Miles?
Miles?

188
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,013
谁放你出来的
Who the hell let you out?

189
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,070
给我这个的人
The people who gave me this.

190
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,084
他们想要谈谈
They want to talk.

191
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,035
你这个饕餮之徒  你跟踪我
You vultures, you followed me

192
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,011
到提特里克  来监视我?
to tikrit... to spy on me?!

193
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,085
你到这里来干什么
What are you doing here?

194
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,056
我来找出杀你妻子的凶手
I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.

195
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,090
你怎么到这里来的?
How did you get here?

196
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,077
我穿过叙利亚的边界过来的
I came across the syrian border.

197
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,079
-这不是你想象中的那么难  -你是怎样逃离
It's really not as difficult as you might-- how did you get off the

198
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,092
那个岛的?

00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,036
你的朋友Desmond有一艘船

00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,021
还记得吗  伊丽莎白号

201
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,085
我沿着航线去了斐济

202
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,056
然后我租了一架飞机
Then I chartered a plane.

203
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,024
为什么是现在
Why now?

204
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:50,000
你还记得Charles Widmore这个名字  对吗
You remember the name charles widmore, don't you?

205
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,004
那个家伙  他要全世界的都
The man who tried to convince the world

206
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,081
认为你们的飞机沉入了海底?
That your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?

207
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,030
这和我还有Nadia有什么关系
What does it have to do with me? with nadia?

208
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,061
她的队伍中有一个人
There was a man at her procession.

209
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,058
名字叫Ishmael Bakir
He goes by the name of ishmael bakir.

他是widmore的人

211
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,054
有人五天前在洛杉矶
Bakir was last seen five days ago

212
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,093
最后一次看到Bakir
In los angeles,

213
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,031
是一个交通摄像头拍到的
Caught by a traffic camera,

214
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:20,021
超速从La brea和Santa monica的街角冲出去
Speeding away from the corner of la brea and santa monica.

215
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,034
那里离Nadia被杀的地方只有三个街区之遥
That's three blocks from where nadia was killed.

216
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:39,019
这些人为什么要杀她
Why would these people want to murder her?

217
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,034
我不知道
I don't know.

218
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,066
但是他们已经把她杀了
But they did.

219
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,050
他们有多少人
How many of 'em are there?

220
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,048
可能是6个  我不太清楚
Maybe six. I'm not sure.

221
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,033
你意思是你不确定
The hell you mean, you ain't sure?

222
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,029
你跟他们乘同一条船来的  不是吗
You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?

223
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,093
他们告诉我他们只是保卫人员
They told me they were just security.

224
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,028
-保护什么  -保护他
Security for what? for him.

225
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,094
只要他们抓到他  就会押送他回到美国本土
Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.

226
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,048
好吧  Miles  听起来
Well, miles, sounds like

227
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:15,066
你不准备要你的3200万美金了
You're not gonna collect your $3.2 million.

228
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,056
拿走吧
Just take it.

229
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,022
我为什么会跟他们谈话
Why would I talk to them?

230
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,059
因为他们有人质
Because they have a hostage.

231
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,084
那他们严重失算了
Well, then they've badly miscalculated,

232
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,040
因为我的人
Cause every single one of my people

233
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,043
-都准备好为岛而亡了  -是你女儿
Is prepared to die in service to this island. it's your daughter!

234
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,011
喂

00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,096
是Benjamin Linus吗
Am I speaking to benjamin linus?

236
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:55,016

我是Charles Widmore的手下

-谁是Charles Widmore?  -先听下
Who's charles widmore? later.

240
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,049
我要你从东边的窗户向外看看
I'd like you to go look out your east window

241
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:06,075
这样我们就可以面谈了
So we can talk about this face-to-face.

242
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,011
左边
To the left.

247
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,019
把手放在头上
Put your hands above your head,

248
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,092
对直朝我走过来
And you're gonna walk straight to me.

249
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,099
只要你在我手上  我保证
Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you

250
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:34,007
屋子里的其他人会毫发无伤
That no one else in that house will be harmed.

251
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,048
你我都知道  只要你抓住了我
You and I both know that once you have me,

252
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,053
你就会毫无顾忌地
There's nothing to stop you

253
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:43,062
在这岛上大开杀戒
From killing everybody else on this island.

254
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:46,008
你认为我是那样的人?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

Martin christopher keamy
Martin christopher keamy--

256
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:51,082
前美国海军陆战队的一级士官

258
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:55,088

你工作于一些雇佣军集团

260
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,044
特别是在乌干达

261
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:05,068
所以我完全清楚你的底细  Keamy先生
So I know exactly what kind of man you are, mr. keamy,

262
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,077
我们可以不用拘束于礼节
And we can dispense with the formalities.

263
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:12,087
好的  Ben  你说对了

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,038
跪下
Get down.

265

你现在就给我滚出来
Get your ass out here right now...

266
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:41,072
否则我就杀了你女儿
Or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

267
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,055
我倒是有个相反的提议
I'd like to present a counterproposal.

268
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,003
我听着
I'm listening.

269
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:04,009
你和你的同伙
You and your friends...

270
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,058
你转过身去
You turn around.

271
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,086
回到你的直升机那去
Walk back to your helicopter.

272
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:12,021
然后飞走  就当作自己从来没有来到这岛上
You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.

273
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:23,006
和你老爸说拜拜吧
Tell your daddy good-bye.

274
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,067
爸
Dad...

275
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,018
他们是当真的
They're serious.

276
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:32,038
他们已经杀了karl和我妈了
They killed karl and my mother.

277
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,022
Alex...
Alex...

278
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,073
一切都在掌握之中
I have this under control.

279
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:38,025
一定会没事的
Everything's gonna be okay.

280
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,002
求你了  爸爸
Please, daddy!

281
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:43,046
求你了  求你了

给你10秒钟  Ben
You have ten seconds, Ben.

283
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:49,012
好吧  听着
Okay, listen.

284
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,036
九...
Nine...

285
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,091
她不是我女儿
She's not my daughter.

286
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,035
八...
Eight...

287
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:55,059
她还是个婴儿的时候
I stole her as a baby

288
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,011
我从一个疯女人把她那里偷过来的
from an insane woman.

289
00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:00,061
她只不过我手中的一颗棋子  仅此而已
She's a pawn, nothing more.

290
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,050
对我来说  她什么都不是
She means nothing to me.

291
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:11,081
我是不会出去的
I'm not coming out of this house.

292
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,087
所以  要是你想杀了  尽管开枪好了--
So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it--

293
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,059
他们走了
I don't see 'em.

294
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:46,051
他们把她的尸体留那里  人都消失在丛林了
They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.

295
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:47,091
他们一定还没走多远
They won't be gone for long.

296
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,008
再过20分钟天就要黑了
It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes,

297
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,067
到时  他们还会再来抓他
And then they're gonna come for him.

298
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:56,052
我们把他交出去得了
Then let's just hand him over.

299
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,088
我想这些人根本就没打算让我们
I don't think these people have any intentions

300
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:02,000
活着离开这里  James
Of letting us walk of here alive, James,

301
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,048
不管我们怎么做
No matter what we do.

302
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,061
我还不想死呢
Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.

303
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:09,020
他篡改了规则
He changed the rules.

304
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,059
你说什么?  谁?
What? who?

305
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:14,060
什么规则?
What rules?

306
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:23,035
你知道  我是对的
You know I'm right.

307
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:26,067
我们最好把他交出去  保住自己
Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.

308
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:31,058
嘿  你去哪
Hey! Where you goin'?

309
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:35,098
把这该死的门打开!
Open this damn door!

310
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,049
打开啊!
Open up!

311
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,058
走
Walk.

312
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,016
你是谁  你为什么要跟踪我?
Who are you and why are you following me?

313
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,055
我叫Benjamin Linus
My name is Benjamin Linus.

314
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,008
我要你帮我给Widmore先生捎个口信
And I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.

315
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,008
什么口信?
And what message is that?

316
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,054
杀的好
That should do it.

317
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,000
等等
Wait.

318
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,013
你要去哪里?
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:49,041
该结束了  Sayid
We're finished here, Sayid.

320
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,075
转身走开  当作什么都没发生
Turn around and walk away.

321
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:55,059
继续你对她的哀悼  继续你的生活吧
Mourn your loss. get on with your life.

322
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:58,072
我已经没法生活了  被他们夺走了
I have no life. they took it from me.

323
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,062
回去吧  Sayid
Go home, sayid.

324
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,009
一旦让你的悲痛变成了愤怒
Once you let your grief become anger,

325
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,068
你就没法脱身了
It will never go away.

326
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,017
这是我的经验之谈
I speak from experience.

327
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,025
这是我的战斗  和你没关
This is my war. It's not yours.

328
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:18,054
过去的八年  我一直的苦苦寻觅
I spent the last eight years of my life

329
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,085
我深爱的那个女人
Searching for the woman I love.

330
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:25,016
我最终找了  并和她结了婚
I finally found her and I married her.

331
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,096
可昨天我却参加了她的葬礼
And I buried her yesterday.

332
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,073
所以别跟我说  这不是我的战斗
So don't tell me this is not my war.

333
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:41,006
Benjamin...
Benjamin...

334
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,039
下个目标是谁?
Who's next?

335
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,011
我会联系你的
I'll be in touch.

336
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,025
把这该死的门打开!
Open the damn door!

337
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:02,039
狗娘养的  把我们扔这了
Son of a bitch just left us here.

338
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,041
把门打开  怎么了
Open the damn door! what's going on?

339
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,080
Claire?
Claire?

340
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,055
你没事吧  宝贝
You all right, sweetheart?

341
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:13,011
没事  有点站不稳  毕竟  我还活着
yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.

342
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:14,077
话不要说的太快
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

343
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,012
请原谅  James
Excuse me, James.

344
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:22,007
原谅你?
Excuse you?

345
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,038
你在里面做什么了?
What were you doing in there?

346
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,005
好吧  你们听仔细了
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

347
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:30,020
我要你完全按照我的话去做
I need all of you to do exactly as I say.

348
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,088
一分钟后  我们得拼命地从这跑出去
In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can.

349
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,082
在我下令后  我要你们
At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head

350
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:37,049
直接往树林那边跑
Straight for the tree line.

351
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:41,006
你是说跑向那些持枪的家伙?
You mean towards the guys with guns?

352
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,067
不是  我们要尽可能的离他们远点
No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.

353
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:13,033
好了  跑出去  快点出去
Okay, outside. outside now!

354
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,002
你做什么了?!
What did you do?!

355
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,080
你把那东西召出来了?
Did you just call that thing?

356
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,010
折回去!
Fall back!

357
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,029
跑!  跑  快跑!
Go! go, go!

358
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,051
往树林那边跑  我会赶上去的
Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.

359
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:01,087
嘿  你要去那?
Hey, where are you going?

360
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:05,055
我总得和我女儿告个别啊  John
I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.

361
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:13,034
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

362
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,030
可能真有信号
Might actually have a signal.

363
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,081
你在发送什么?
What are you sending?

364
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,046
"医生..."
"what..."

365
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,066

00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,090
"现在..."
"to...

367
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,084
怎么样了...?"
The... doctor?"

368
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:00,092
好吧  他们没确切地说医生怎么样了
Okay. they didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor,

369
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,064
但你们的朋友都没事
But your friends are fine,

370
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,062
直升机明早就会回来
And the helicopter's coming back in--in the morning.

371
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,061
还有?
Well?

372
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,081
他在说谎
He's lying.

373
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,094
那条信息说的是:"你在说什么?"
What the message said was, "what are you talking about?

374
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,023
医生他很好"
The doctor is fine."

375
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:25,028
你知道摩尔斯电码
You know morse code.

376
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:29,091
那是什么意思--
What does that mean--

377
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:32,076
"医生他很好"
"the doctor is fine"?

378
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:34,045
我不知道
I don't know.

379
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,093
你干嘛撒谎?
Why are you lying?

380
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:39,042
你为什么要说
Why did you say

381
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,077
直升机明早回来?
That the helicopters are coming back?

382
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:45,086
Jack
Jack.

383
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:49,080
你会不会...把我们带离这个岛?
Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?

384
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,005
不会

385
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,025
不会
No.

386
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,074
-Jack  -不会
-Jack. -No.

387
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:33,035
你的宝贝直升机向那边飞走了
I think your chopper buddies ran that way,

388
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:34,072
想追就去吧
If you wanna catch up.

389
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:38,006
好吧  不过我现在--现在还会和你们呆在一起
Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for--for now.

390
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,025
你女儿的死我很难过
Sorry about your daughter.

391
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:04,028
谢谢你  John
Thank you, John.

392
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:07,052
别废话  你向我撒谎了
That being said, you lied to me.

393
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:10,061
你说你不知道那烟一样的怪物是什么
You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.

394
00:35:11,064 --> 00:35:14,054
我们到了木屋后你可以问Jacob一切
You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.

395
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:18,029
等等  "Jacob?"
Hang on. "Jacob"?

396
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:22,022
谁是Jacob?
Who the hell's Jacob?

397
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:26,020
他会告诉我们下来该怎么做  James
He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.

398
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,002
你知道吗?我受够了
You know what? I'm done with all this.

399
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,095
我一开始就不该跟你们这帮疯子一起
I never should have followed you wackos in the first place.

400
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:35,060
我要跟Claire和孩子一起回海岸去
I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid

401

00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:48,003
走吧  你也来  Hurley
Let's go. You, too, Hurley.

405
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,079
你疯了吗?
Have you lost your mind?

406
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:01,033
Hugo必须和我们一起
Hugo stays with us.

407
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,041
-决不  -等等  别把我扯进去啊
-Not a chance. -Wait. Leave me out of this.

408
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,077
不好意思  Hugo  我们需要你找到木屋
I'm sorry, Hugo. we need you to find the cabin.

409
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,006
他不会和你去任何地方的
He ain't goin' anywhere with you,

410
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,062
-你个疯狗  -停下!都把枪放下  我和Locke走
-You crazy son of a bitch. -Stop! put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.

411
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,009
-Hugo  -没事的  Sawyer
-Hugo. -It's okay, Sawyer.

412
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:23,029
拜托  放下枪
Please, put your gun down.

413
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,067
你也是

414
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,090
你没必要这么做
You don't have to do this.

415

你们先回海滩  我迟早会赶上的
You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.

416
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:47,014
你要是敢动他一根毫毛...
You harm so much as one hair on his curly head...

417
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,047
我就要你的命
I'll kill you.

418
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,004
好吧
Fair enough.

419
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:03,065
我们走  走吧  走
Let's go. Go. Move.

420
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:16,041
怎么走?

00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:47,040
晚上好  先生  需要帮忙吗?

这么晚吗  先生?
At this hour, sir?

425
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,070

They're expecting me.

你只管打电话确认好了
Feel free to call up.

427
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,022
不用了  先生  晚安  先生
No need, sir. Good night, sir.

428
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,057
Charles  醒醒
Wake up, Charles.

429
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,079
我想着你什么时候会出现
I wondered when you were gonna show up.

430
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,023
我看到你好像晒黑了些
I see you've been getting more sun.

431
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:21,053
伊拉克现在正是好时节
Iraq is lovely this time of year.

432
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,031
你什么时候开始和苏格兰威士忌共眠了?
When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?

433
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:29,090
当噩梦开始时
When the nightmares started.

434
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,010
你来是要杀我的吗  Benjamin?
Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?

435
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:47,023
我俩都知道我不会那么做
We both know I can't do that.

436
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:51,017
那你为什么来这?
Then why are you here?

437
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,094
我来  Charles
I'm here, Charles,

438
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,099
是因为你谋杀了我的女儿
Because you murdered my daughter.

439
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,024
别站在那  用你那双
Don't stand there, looking at me

440
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,017
可怕的眼睛盯着我
With those horrible eyes of yours

441
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:07,083
还把那个可怜女孩的死归因于我
And lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me

442
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,081
我们都知道
When we both know very well

443
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:13,069
她根本不是我杀的  Benjamin
I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin.

444
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:16,022
是你
You did.

445
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,053
不  不是那样的
No, that's not true.

446
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,026
是的  Benjamin  是那样的
Yes, Benjamin, it is.

447
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:27,057
你想耗子一样在午夜潜进我的房子
You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night like a rat

448
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,096
厚颜无耻的想摆脱自己的罪名?
And have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?

449
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,046
我知道你是谁  孩子...
I know who you are, boy...

450
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,021
你是什么样的人
What you are.

451
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:42,037
我知道你拥有的  你从我这里抢走的
I know that everything you have you took from me.

452
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:49,037
所以...我再问你一次
So... once again I ask you,

453
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:52,041
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

454
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,037
我来  Charles
I'm here, Charles,

455
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:58,050
是告诉你我要杀了你女儿
To tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter.

456
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,017
她叫Penelope  是吗?
Penelope, is it?

457
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,069
她离去后...
And once she's gone...

458
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:10,095
当她死后...
Once she's dead...

459
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,053
你就会明白我现在的感受
Then you'll understand how I feel.

460
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,045
你就会希望你没有篡改规则
And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.

461
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:30,031
你不会找到她的
You'll never find her.

462
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,012
那个岛是我的  Benjamin
That island's mine, Benjamin.

463
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:39,096
它以前一直是  以后也会是
It always was. It will be again.

464
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,007
但你永远找不到它
But you'll never find it.

465
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,034
那我觉得我们俩都得开始寻找了
Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.

466
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,021
我觉得是
I suppose it is.

467
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:54,067
好好睡吧  Charles
Sleep tight, Charles.

468
00:41:55,027 --> 00:42:01,033
