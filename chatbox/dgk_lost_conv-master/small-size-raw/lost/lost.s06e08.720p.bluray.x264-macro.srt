A while.

7
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,061

If she's here, you got my word. We ain't leaving without her.

我本来不想让你看见的
You weren't exactly supposed to see that.

40
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,001
Jimmy 你拿这么多钱要干什么?

00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,731
这次会面 有可能做成一笔交易
This meeting is a potential investment.

42
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,901
我们约定五五分账
We're going 50/50.

43
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,191
那家伙想先看到钱
The guy wants to see the money upfront.

然后我们就去兜风... 喔
Me and you'll go for round... Whoa.

46
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:00,881
离箱子远点
Step away from the case.

47
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,141
别乱来 宝贝
Take it easy, honey.

48
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,701
帅哥 有件事我得告诉你
Here's the thing, dimples.

49
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,451
我知道骗子的花样 我前夫就是骗子
I can spot a con man. I'm married to one.

50
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,631
所以我知道你们那些伎俩
So I know all about the pigeon drop.

51
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,881
哦 你刚说啥? 那箱子是偶然打开的?
Oh, what? That case just accidentally flew open?

52
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,851
你以为我笨得像头猪?
How stupid do you think I am?

53
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,321
事实上 你真是头蠢猪
Pretty damn stupid, actually.

54
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:21,941
什么?
Excuse me?

55
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:23,941
我的确在演戏 女人
This is a setup, lady.

56
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,081
屋外停着辆面包车
There's a van sittin' right outside.

57
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,111
这房子装了窃听器 已经被警察包围了
The room is bugged. The place is surrounded by cops.

58
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:30,661
所以现在 你把枪放下
So now you wanna put that gun down,

59
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,131
然后我们把事情理理清
and we'll work something out.

60
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,631
他们的目标不是你 他们要捉的是你丈夫
They don't care about you. They want your husband.

61
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,211
这箱子里有个追踪器 你所要做的
There's a tracer in the case. All you had to do

62
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,741
就是把你丈夫的藏身之处说出来
was take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out.

63
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:42,791
你以为我真的会相信
You really except me to believe

64
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,341
你是警方派来的?
that you're working with the police?

65
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,751
如果这地方被包围了
If this place is surrounded,

66
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,841
为什么没一个人进来救你?
how come no one came to save you?

67
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,021
我不需要救援
I don't need saving,

68
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,481
因为你会听话
'cause you're gonna do the right thing

69
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,921
乖乖把枪放下 但如果你不放
and put that gun down. But if you don't,

70
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,891
那么 我也有办法
well, then all I gotta do is say the magic work,

71
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,321
让那扇门为我打开
and that door busts open.

72
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,321
你真是个蹩脚的骗子
You're a lousy con man.

73

75
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:09,901
警察! 把枪放下!
Police! Drop the gun!

76
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,911
- 手背过来 - 我们进来得早了点儿吧?
- Behind your back. - Cuttin' it a little close, huh?

77
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,241
实在没办法啊
Only way to cut it.

78
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,831
把你的衣服穿起来 Jim
Put your damn clothes on, Jim.

79
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,371
没问题 好搭档
You got it, partner.

80
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,701
- 你是警察? - 惊讶吧
- You're a cop? - Surprise.

81
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,801
走吧 快走
Let's go. Move.

82
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:41,801

85
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,540

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,640
我们度过了...
It was a...

91
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,700
一个漫长而悲惨的夜晚
a long and traumatic night for all of us.

92
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,210
我知道 你们肯定满腹疑问
And you all have got a lot of questions, I know,

93
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,540
我会尽力作答
And I will make myself available to answer them.

94
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,900
但现在 我们得继续出发
But right now we need to keep moving.

95
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,490
- 要抓住白天的优势 - 我们想知道
- We have to take advantage of the daylight. - We wanna know

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,780
留在寺庙的人都怎样了
what happened to the people who stayed behind at the temple.

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,810
黑烟杀了他们
The black smoke killed them.

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,780

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,540

要不要换个地方 私下谈谈?
Maybe we should talk about this in private?

155
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,940
好啊 走吧
Great. Let's go.

156
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,870
我希望你不要打断我的话
I wish you hadn't interrupted me.

157
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
抱歉 我是个粗人
I'm sorry. I forgot my manners.

158
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,620
没事
I forgive ya.

159
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,660
寺庙那儿发生什么事了?
What happened back at the temple?

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,520
你怎么知道 要去把大家从黑烟手中救出来?
How'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing?

161
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,010
我没有救他们
I didn't rescue them.

162
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,000
我就是那黑烟
I'm the smoke thing.

163
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,780
你是说 是你把那些人都杀掉的?
You telling me you killed all those people?

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,650
我给了他们安然逃离的机会
I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully,

165
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,340
- 可他们视如敝屐 - 为什么?
- and they didn't take it. - Why not?

166
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,380
因为他们坚信
Because they're convinced

167
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,600
他们能把岛守得固若金汤 让我无处下手
that they're protecting the island from me,

168
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,980
事实上 我只想离开这里
when, in fact, all I wanna do is leave.

169
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,940
所以我不杀掉他们 就会被他们杀掉
So it's either kill or be killed.

170
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,720
我可不想死
And I don't want to be killed.

171
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,770
我们要坐船?
We goin' on a boat ride?

172
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,010
是你要坐船
You are.

173
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,970
去哪里?
Where?

174
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,260

175
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,950
九头蛇岛上有什么?
What's on Hydra Island?

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,830
飞机 Ajira航空的那架航班
The plane. The Ajira flight.

177

把你朋友带回来的那架飞机

178
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,210
不幸地是 他们身边还有其他人
Unfortunately, they didn't come alone.

179
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,290
我有理由相信
And I have reason to believe that

180
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,310
个别乘客想对我们不利
some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm.

181
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,930
所以我想让你去那边 探探虚实
So I want you to go over there and do some recon.

182
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,860
听上去真安全哦
Well, that sounds safe.

183
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,060
- 你不会有事的 - 是吗? 那如果我
- You'll be fine. - Yeah? Well, what am I supposed to do

184
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,130
碰上了一个想加害我的人 可怎么办啊?
if I run into somebody who wants to do me harm?

185
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,900
- 我不担心这个 - 哦 你不担心 是吧?
- I'm not worried about that. - Oh, you're not, huh?

186
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,750
没错 因为你是我所遇到的 最会说谎的人了
No, because you are the best liar I ever met.

187
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,200
把该说的话都说给他们听
You tell 'em whatever you need to tell 'em

188
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,520
取得他们的信任 探明他们的一切
to gain their trust, find out everything you can about them,

189
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,650
然后回到这儿
and then get back here.

190
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,200
我再做一遍有什么意义啊?
Why exactly am I doing this again?

191
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,780
还有什么好想的呢 James?
Why do you think, James?

192
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,190
我们登上飞机 离开这个岛
We get on the plane, we fly off this island,

193
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,950
就永远不会再回来了
and we never look back.

194
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,670
来吧
Come on.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,450

你喜欢像"夺宝奇兵"里演的那样吗?

Yes. I'm exactly like Indiana Jones.

215
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,120
你也有根鞭子?
You got a whip?

216
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,580
或许吧

Okay, do me a favor, James, and don't treat me like

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,470
我...
I...

305
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,500
我们... 我们的飞机失事了
We... We crashed here,

306
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,120
大家还等着有人来...
and we were all just waiting for...

307
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,270
有人来救我们
someone to rescue us.

308
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,770
我正出去捡柴禾的时候
I was out collecting wood

309
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,480
突然听到...
when I heard...

310
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,860
尖叫声
screaming.

311
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,750
尖叫声?
Screaming?

312
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,280
当...
When...

313
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,770
当我回来的时候...
When I came back...

314
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,300
他们... 他们都已经死了
they were... they were all dead.

315
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,810
我花了两天时间 把这些尸体拖到一起
I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here.

316
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,910
我不想让他们就这么曝晒在太阳底下
I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun.

317
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,020
你一个人吗?
Are you alone?

318
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,160
不是 我和一群人要回主岛
No. I'm with a group of people back on the main island.

319
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,510
- 我可以带你过去 - 哦 感谢上帝
- I can take you back there. - Oh, thank God.

320
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,860
信我一句吧
Trust me,

321
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,800
上帝才不管这事呢
God's got nothing to do with it.

322
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,570
对不起 Kate
I'm sorry, Kate.

323
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,180
什么?
Excuse me?

324
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,930
我得为Claire的行为向你道歉
I have to take responsibility for Claire's behavior.

325
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,140
我告诉她 是The Others带走了她的孩子
I was the one who told her that The Others had her baby.

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,950
你为什么要这么跟她说?
Why would you tell her that?

327
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,340
你有仇人吗?
Have you ever had an enemy?

328
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,900
让你憎恨万分的仇人?
Someone that you needed to hate?

329
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,380
突然感到有力量了 是吧?
Very powerful, isn't it?

330
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,880
失去Aaron以后 Claire几近崩溃了
Claire was devastated without Aaron.

331
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,190
她需要一些...
She needed something to...

332
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,170
一些让她活下去的动力 所以...
something to keep her going, so...

333
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,960
我给她制造了假想敌
I gave her something to hate.

334
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,220
当你告诉她真相的时候
And then when you told her the truth,

335
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,340
所有那些感觉 所有... 所有那些愤怒
all those feelings, all... all that anger

336
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,980
那些支撑她这么久的动力...
that she'd been holding on to for so long...

337
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,110
全都消失了
It had to go somewhere.

338
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,660
真有远见...
Very insightful...

339
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,360
出自一个死人之口
Coming from a dead man.

340
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,320
嗯
Mm.

341
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,900
人无完人
Well, nobody's perfect.

342
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,210
很抱歉发生了这样的事
I'm sorry that this happened.

343
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,200
我保证只要你给她些时间
And I'm sure if you give her time,

344
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,390
一切都会好起来的
everything will be all right.

345
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,460
之前我答应过 我会确保大家的安全
I promised before that I would keep everyone safe,

346
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,110
这话对你也同样适用 Kate
and that means you, too, Kate.

347
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,790
Sawyer去哪儿了?
Where did Sawyer go?

348
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,130
我会告诉你的
I'll show you.

349
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,120
觉得它还能飞吗?
Think that thing'll still fly?

350
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,940
我不知道 估计得费点儿工夫
I don't know. It'll take a bit of work

351
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,200
还得找个知道如何... 如何来操作的人才行
and someone who knows how to... how to do it.

352
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,170
我... 我猜你没有遇到过飞行员吧?
I... I take it you haven't come across the pilot?

353
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,070
是的 夫人
No, ma'am.

354
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,210
你刚刚说 有多少人和你在一块儿的?
How many people did you say were with you?

355
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,370
二十来个吧
Couple dozen.

356
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,270
他们都是和你乘同一架飞机来的?
Did they all come on the same plane with you?

357
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,300
有些是 但不全是
Some, not all.

358
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,700
你们的飞机是什么时候失事的?
When did you crash?

359
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,500
很久以前
Long time ago.

360
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,830
你们都有枪吗?
Do you all have guns?

361
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,080
我是说 不管是谁杀了这些人
I mean, whoever killed those people back there,

362
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,610
他们... 他们可能会再回来
they... they might come back.

363
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,840
哦 我们有很多枪
Yeah, we got plenty of guns.

364
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,480
你抓住那头好吗?
You wanna grab that end?

365
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,080
你说你要去哪?
Where'd you say you were headed?

366
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,360

你的航班 目的地是哪儿?

368
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,820
哦 呃...
Oh. Uh...

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,760
关岛

370
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,080
谁在关岛么?
What's in Guam?

371
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,380
我男朋友
My boyfriend.

372
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,460
你戏演得真好 宝贝 但是还没好到滴水不漏
You're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good.

373
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,800
- 你在说什么? - 你是谁?
- What are you talking about? - Who are you?

374
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,620
放下你的武器! 马上放下!
Drop your weapon down! Drop it now!

375
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,040
你的名字Zoe 是真的吗?
Your name even Zoe?

376
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,990
你是叫Sawyer吗?
Is yours Sawyer?

377
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,430
跪下!
Down on your knees!

378
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,300
好的 好的 我很听话的
All right, all right. You got me.

379
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,230
带我去见你们的头儿
Take me to your leader.

380
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,120
小岛在那边... 我派Sawyer去那了
That island over there... that's where I sent Sawyer.

381
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,070
你只需要告诉我
You could've just told me

382
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,330
你派他去的是 那个我们曾被困在牢笼里的小岛
that you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages.

383
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,010
你没必要带我来这里
You didn't have to bring me down here.

384
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,140
是的 但是那时候我没机会对你说
Sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you.

385
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,650
你把我当死人
You referred to me as a dead man.

386
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,020
我不是死人
I am not a dead man.

387
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,810
我知道你的感受 Kate
I know what you're feeling, Kate.

388
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,250
我知道你的经历
I know what you're going through.

389
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,750
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

390
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,170
因为...
Because...

391
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,040
我妈妈疯了
my mother was crazy.

392
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,150
很久很久以前 在我...
A long time ago, before I...

393
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,870
就像... 这么大的时候
looked... like this,

394
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,540
像所有人一样 我有一个妈妈
I had a mother, just like everyone.

395
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,470
她是个精神错乱的女人
She was a very disturbed woman.

396
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,360
正因为如此...
And as a result of that...

397
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,190
我的成长之路异常艰辛...
I had some growing pains...

398
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,030
问题是 我还得努力杀出一条血路
problems that I'm still trying to work my way through.

399
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,270
如果能...
Problems that...

400
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,690
避免... 这些问题
could h... have been avoided,

401
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,430
如今会大不相同
had things been different.

402
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,130
为什么要跟我说这些?
Why are you telling me this?

403
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,770
因为现在... Aaron...
Because now... Aaron...

404
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,140
也有一个疯妈妈
has a crazy mother, too.

405
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,800
下去 他在等你
Get in. He's waiting for you.

406
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,150
我不是担心我自己
It's not me I'm worried about.

407
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,540
我只是不知道 如果你和妈妈
I just don't know what I'd do

408
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,520
发生什么事 我应该做什么
if anything ever happened to you and ma.

409
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,460
不管怎样 我们不会有事的
Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us.

410
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,610
至少今天不会
Not today, anyway.

411
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,510
这就是你生活的方式
It's the way you live this life,

412
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,810
每天一次
Each day one at a time.

413
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,150
如果你一辈子都在
Now if you spend your whole life

414
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,910
杞人忧天
worrying about something that's gonna happen,

415
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,040
在你意识到之前 你的生活已经结束了
before you know it, your life's over

416
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,410
你一辈子都只是在痛苦地担心
and you spent an awful lot of it just worrying.

417
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,730
嘿 你听见没?
Hey, you hear that?

418
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,800
这才是生活的全部...
That's what life's all about...

419
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,320
笑对生活 彼此相爱
laughing and loving each other,

420
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,390
知道当人们死的时候 他们并没有消失
and knowing that people aren't really gone when they die.

421
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,580
美好的回忆支撑着我们
We have all the good memories to sustain us

422
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,240
直到再次相见
until we see 'em again.

423
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,150
想要不害怕 很难 爸爸
It's hard not being afraid, pa.

424
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,490
我知道 宝贝儿
I know, sweetheart

425
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,380
我知道
I know.

426
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,390
你真会开玩笑
You've got to be joking.

427
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,130
我能进去吗?
May I come in?

428
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,080
- 当然不能 - 为什么?
- Absolutely not. - Why not?

429
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,340
你不是吧 凌晨3点把我踢出来
You don't get to kick me out at 3:00 in the morning

430
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,810
然后第二天过来
and then come 'round the next day

431
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,350
带着一副小狗似的可怜眼神 和一朵忧郁的向日葵
with puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower.

432
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,040
听着 我不知道
Look, I don't know

433
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,510
你是因为孤寂 或内疚 还是完全疯了
if you're just lonely or guilty or completely mad.

434
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,910
但是你知道吗? 我不在乎 是你搞砸的一切
But you know what? I don't care. You blew it.

435
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,890
- 你把什么锁在这里? - 不关你事 快走
- What you got in here? - None of your business. Keep moving.

436
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,870
进来
Come.

437
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,520
他来了 老大

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,820
谢谢 Zoe
Thanks, Zoe.

439
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,000
能让我们单独待会儿吗?
Would you leave us, please?

440
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,830
没问题
Of course.

441
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,510

443
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,000
- 你知道我是谁吗? - 我当然知道
- Do you know who I am? - Of course I do.

444
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,430
你派了艘船到岛上 还下令手下杀光我们
You're the fella sent a freighter to the island, and order the guys to kill us all.

445
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,960
真可怜...
It's sad, really...

446
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,900
你知道的太少了
How little you actually know.

447
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,370
哦 我知道是你们杀了所有人
Well, I know you murdered all them people out there

448
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,280
- 然后把他们扔到沟里 - 我们没杀那些人
- and dropped 'em in the ditch. - We didn't murder those people.

449
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,180
但是我也不指望你能相信
But I don't expect you to believe that.

450
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,310
很好 因为我根本就不信
Good, 'cause I don't.

451
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,520
那你跟我说说 谁派你来这个岛上的?
So why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island?

452
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,780
John Locke派我来的
John Locke sent me.

453

我想我俩都知道 我所说这个人
I think we both know the guy I'm talking about

455
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,360
不是真的Locke
is not really Locke.

456
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,360
我们做个交易吧 老大

我回去告诉他 海岸上什么都没有
I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear,

458
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,660
我连人影都没发现
that I didn't find anybody.

459
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,400
然后我把那个老头带到你门口
Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep.

460
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,980
接着你就可以杀了他

那么...
So...

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,480
我...

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,760
我只是...
I just, um...

475
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,360
我只想说 对不起
I... I just wanna say I'm sorry.

476
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,180
我不知道我为什么那么做
I don't know why I did that.

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,050
我知道你做的一切 都是因为你关心我
I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me

478
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,360
和Aaron

好了啊
It's okay.

486
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,800
怎么样?
How'd go?

487
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
你不是真的派我去那儿
You didn't really send me over there

488
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,620
找飞机上的乘客吧?
to find passengers from that plane, did you?

489
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,990
不是
No.

490
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,580
如果你感兴趣
Well, in case you're interested,

491
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,930
他们都死了
they're all dead.

492
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,490
哦 真惨啊
Well, that's terrible.

493
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,890
发生了什么?
What happened?

494
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,260
我不知道
I don't know.

495
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,910
James 你知道什么?
Well, what do you know, James?

496
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,920
我知道那个小岛有个人
I know there's a man over there on that island

497
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,710
如果不打一仗 他不会让我们登机的
that ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight.

498
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,050
他叫Widmore 驾着一艘潜艇来的
Came over on a sub. Name's Widmore.

499
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,900
Charles Widmore吗?
Charles Widmore?

500
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,590
哦 我想你们认识
Well, I guess y'all know each other.

501
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,560
他不是一个人
He ain't alone.

502
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,060
至少有6个全副武装的同伙
I counted at least six armed compadres with him,

503
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,550
还不算潜艇上的工作人员
not to mention whatever crew's on that sub.

504
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,180
那有个锁着的房间... 有东西藏在里面
There's a locked room on there... somethin' they're hiding.

505
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,840
他们还在架设电缆塔 就像在New Otherton的那些塔一样
And they're settin' up pylons, like the ones at New Otherton.

506
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,230
你知道的...
You know...

507
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,220
那些塔能抵御黑烟
the ones that keep out that smoke thing.

508
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,650
你跟他们怎么说我的?
And what did you tell them about me?

509
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,550
我告诉他们
I told them

510
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,080
我会告诉你那岸上没人 然后带你过去
I'd tell you the coast was clear and bring you back with me.

511
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,330
带你径直走进他们的陷阱
Walk you right into their trap.

512
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,500
那样 他们可以杀了你...
That way, they could kill you...

513
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,230
这意味着 当我们改变进攻计划的话
which means they'll be caught with their pants down

514
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,000
他们来不及反应 就会束手待毙
when we change our plan of attack.

515
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,610
James 我感谢你的忠心
I appreciate your loyalty, James.

516
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,090
你说过要送我离开这个岛
You said you were gonna get me off this island.

517
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,970
说话要算话
Deal's a deal.

518
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,620
- 你在这干嘛? - 上车
- What are you doing here? - Get in the car.

519
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,660
Sawyer是谁?
Who's Sawyer?

520
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,670
我9岁的时候
When I was 9 years old,

521
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,760
我爸杀了我妈 然后他自杀了

522
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,370
Sawyer是罪魁祸首
Sawyer was the reason why.

523
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,870
他是个骗子

大骗子

525

自从我大学毕业以后
I've been hunting him down

526
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,830
一直在追捕他
since the day I left the academy.

527
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,040
我在澳大利亚追查到一个线索
I chased down a lead in Australia,

got a name... Anthony Cooper.

529
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,820
我搜索这个名字 得到一堆叫Anthony Cooper的人
I ran the name. I got a list of Anthony Coopers,

530
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,880
于是我挨个调查他们
and I've been calling them.

531
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,030
当我找到要找的那个...
And when I find the right one...

532
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,620
我会杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

533
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,410
为什么以前 你一点都没跟我说过?
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

534
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,860
我知道你一直想劝我放弃
I knew you'd try and talk me out of it.

535
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,380
没错
Damn right.

536
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,780
好极了
Fair enough.

537
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,660
喔! 我的车!
Whoa! My car!

很好 我正饿着
Good. I'm starving.

544

你在为Locke跑腿干什么?
What are you doing running errands for Locke?

我不给任何人跑腿

然而并不是只有飞机

我要让他们打一仗

我们离开这个见鬼的小岛

Even if we could get on that plane, who's gonna fly it?

我们坐潜艇走
