00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,035
剧情回顾...

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,046
我见到了我的亲生父亲
I met my real father.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,090
好消息  不是么?
Great news, right?

4
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,042
他假装很爱我  
He pretended to love me

5
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:09,080
为的就是要偷走我的肾
just long enough to steal my kidney.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,013
我昨晚一直跟着你 
I followed you last night.

7
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,012
那是你父亲的房子吗?
Is it your father's house?

8
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,010
你以后不会再去那个地方了
you're not gonna go to that place anymore.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,010
好的
All right.

10
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:19,023
你认为
You think

11
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:22,036
你是第一个被骗的人么?
you're the first person that ever got conned?

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,040
你需要一个父亲 而我需要一个肾
You needed a father figureand I needed a kidney.

13
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:29,006
-嘿  Helen...  -你得做出选择
-Hey, Helen...  -You're gonna have to choose.

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,010
他还是我
Him or me.

15
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,050
我叫Henry Gale   我从明尼苏达来
My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota.

16
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:39,060
你画一张去你热气球那儿的地图
You draw up a map to your balloon.

17
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:40,096
我们就会去那儿找到它的
 We go out there, we find it.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,080
如果我画错了  他们会杀了我
And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.

19
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,016
你到底知不知道它在哪儿?
Do you or do you not know where it is?

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,016
我在那儿葬了我的妻子
I went back there to bury my wife.

21
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,030
是去他热气球那儿的 
It's to his balloon.

22
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:50,012
这至少要走一天
This is at least a day's walk.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,076
那我们现在就动身  
Then we should get going.

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,036
他说过热气球就在这儿
This is where he said it would be.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,020
-我们得确定一下  -如果我是他们中的一个
-We need to be sure.  -If I was one of them,

26
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,020
那些你们认为是敌人的人
these people that you seem to think are your enemies,

27
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,033
那儿就不会有什么热气球了
there'd be no balloon.

28
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,078
我会画一张去一个隐秘的地方的地图
So I'd draw a map to a real secluded place.

29
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,096
当你们的朋友到那儿时  
And when your friends got there,

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,046
一群我的人就会在那儿等他们了
a bunch of my people'd be waiting for them.

31
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:13,000
还好我不是他们的一员  不是么?
I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,076
-我做了什么你要带我去郊游?  -什么?  
-So, what did I do to deserve this?  -What?

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,026
一个小伙子就不能带他的女朋友
Can't a fella take his girl

34
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:47,056
出去野餐吗?还得要原因?
out for a picnic lunch just 'cause?

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,010
"小伙子"?
"Fella"?

36
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:52,076
是的  小伙子
That's right. Fella.

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,073
那么  你准备带我去哪?
So, where you taking me?

38
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,093
我不会说的  你别问了
I'm not telling, so just quit asking.

39
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,030
没有我能帮上忙的吗?
Can I be of any help?

40
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,086
你就看讣告  喝咖啡就行了
You just read your obituaries and drink your coffee

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,076
所有的事情我来处理
and I'll take care of the everything.

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,066
别看不起讣告
Don't knock the obits;

43
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,010
这是报纸最有意思的部分
it's the nicest part of the paper.

44
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,080
人一旦死了就不会有人再对他说三道四
No one ever says anything mean about people once they're dead.

45
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,080
恩  在我看来
Mm. And here I am thinking

46
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,076
连环画才是报纸上最有意思的部分
the funnies are the nicest part of the paper.

47
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,063
John?

48
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,060
John  你父亲叫什么?
John, what's your father's name?

49
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,026
怎么了?
Why?

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,033
是叫Anthony么?
Is it Anthony?

51
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,036
Anthony Cooper

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,070
是的  是叫这个名字
Yes. That's right.

53
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,013
他死了
He's dead.

54
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,033
再画一遍
Draw it again,

55
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,060
去你热气球那儿的地图
the map to your balloon.

56
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:05,080
我在开玩笑  一个玩笑罢了
I was joking. I was making a joke.

57
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:11,036
那儿除了我的热气球就没别的了
There's nothing out there besides my balloon.

58
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,016
我只是太沮丧了
I was just frustrated.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,000
这么说太愚蠢了
It was a stupid thing to say.

60
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,036
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,015
无论如何  现在太晚了 
It's too late anyway.

62
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,016
她已经走出很远了  Jack
She's already long gone, Jack.

63
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,063
那么  该做的都做了
So, what's done is done?

64
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,016
是的
That's right.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
把他带回武器库去
Put him back in the armory.

66
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,033
为什么让他对你这么说话?
Why do you let him talk to you like that?

67
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:59,013
等等  我...
Hey, wait, I...

68
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,020
闭嘴
Shut up.

69
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:05,016
John  我很抱歉
John, I'm sorry.

70
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,046
John

71
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,030
也许他画错了
Maybe he's wrong.

72
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,010
我们应该找找悬崖另一边
We should search the other side of the cliff.

73
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,030
我们已经找了三小时了
We've been searching for three hours.

74
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,096
热气球根本不存在  Charlie
This balloon does not exist.Charlie!

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
那么他为什么画这张地图?
Then why'd he draw the map?

76
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,093
你告诉他你会保护他的
You told him you'd protect him

77
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,093
不管找不找得到热气球
whether we found the balloon or not.

78
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,053
你又多给了他两天来拖延时间
You've given him two more days to stall,

79
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,036
去想怎么逃跑
to figure out how to escape.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,033
我们到此为止了
We're done.

81
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,000
Charlie

82
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:40,020
在这  往这边
Over here! This way!

83
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,086
Sayid

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,040
他说过他埋了她  是么?
He said he buried her, right?

85
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,070
他的妻子?
His wife?

86
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,043
为什么这里没有雨?
Why isn't it raining here?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000

00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,035
她去丛林了
She took off into the jungle

96
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,058
那要靠猜了
Well, that would,

97
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,051
每次有人告诉我什么 我都要猜他到底是什么意思
like, assume anybody actually tells me anything.

98
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,078
也许如果我在你们圈子里 
Maybe if I were in the loop,

99
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,028
就能帮上点什么忙了
I could be more helpful.

100
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,028
根本没什么圈子  Hurley
There is no loop, Hurley.

101
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,046
打扰一下  Jack  
Excuse me, Jack.

102
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,098
他全身火热还有点焦躁不安
He's been really hot and fussy.

103
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,041
你能看一下么?
Do you mind having a look?

104
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,058
-恩  好的好的  -谢谢
-Yeah. Sure, sure.  -Thanks.

105
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:14,081
圈子  伙计  圈子
Loop, dude. Loop.

106
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,071
那个  发烧是不是全好了?
So, the fever's completely gone?

107
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,085
全好了
Completely.

108
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,085
你不是随便说说的吧?
You're not just saying that, right?

109
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,045
你看起来有点心烦意乱
You seem a bit distracted.

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,085
不  我很好  Aaron也一样
I'm fine. And so is Aaron.

谢谢
Thanks.

112
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,055
还看诊吗?
Doctor still in?

113
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,015
我在涨潮抓贝类的时候
I was grabbing for mussels in the tide pool,

114
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,035
被海胆扎了
pissed off a sea urchin.

115
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,041
看起来没感染
Well, doesn't look infected.

116
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,058
擦点尼奥普林就没事了
A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.

117
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:42,041
哦  好的  尼奥普林
Yeah. Right. Neosporin.

118
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,075
我想现在的汇率
I think the current rate of exchange is

119
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:48,048
十件衣服才换一管药膏
ten loads of laundry for a tube.

120
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,028
是的
Right.

121
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,015
怎么回事?
What was that?

122
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,091
John?

123
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:33,095
发生什么事了?
What's the matter?

124
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,011
你确定你要这么做?
You sure you want to do this?

125
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,088
你知道  我们可以直接去野餐的
We could just go on that picnic,you know.

126
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,001
很快  我保证
Soon, I promise.

127
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,078
也许他把他的肾留给你了
Maybe he left you his kidney.

128
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:24,055
我们活着的人
"For we who are alive, who are left

129
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:27,055
会与他们在云端重逢
will be caught up together with them in the clouds

130
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,075
在空中共同会见我们的主
to meet the Lord in the air,

131
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,081
之后就会与主同在
and so we will live with the Lord forever. "

132
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:39,051
我们把Anthony Cooper的灵魂托付给你
We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to you,

133
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,061
但是我们永远不会分开
that we shall never be separated.

134
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,000
现在  
And now

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,055
我们一起向耶稣祈祷  阿门
we are united with Christ as we go toward him. Amen.

136
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,028
你想说点什么么  John?
Do you wish to say anything, John?

137
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:10,008
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

138
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,035
John?

139
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:32,088
嘿  你在么?
Hey, you out there?

140
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,075
是什么声音?
What's that noise?

141
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,095
John?  怎么了? 说话啊
John? What's going on? Talk to me.

142
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,055
安静点好么?
Will you be quiet?

143
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,098
告诉我怎么了  到底...
Tell me what's happening. What the hell is...

144
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,098
你给我闭嘴
Will you shut up?

145
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:49,058
10... 9... 8...
Ten, nine, eight,

146
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,011
7...
seven,

147
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,065
6... 5... 4...
six, five, four,

148
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,031
也许你得叫Jack来
-Maybe you should get Jack!

149
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,045
3...
three,

150
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,038
我说了闭嘴
I said, shut up!

151
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,011
怎么了?
What happened?

152
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:32,088
我压四个番木瓜
I bet four papayas.

153
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,091
你不能压  我刚压了
You can't bet. I just bet.

154
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:38,031
你可以叫牌也可以加注
You can either call, or raise,

155
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,028
要么放弃
or lay 'em down, muttonchops.

156
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,088
别看我

很难说  
Hard to say,

164
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:06,085
但你就是为了好玩

我得回舱子里了
-I've gotta head back to the hatch.

舱子又不会自己走掉  医生

175
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,015

那么结论如何  Locke先生?

我都会写进报告里的  但是我想

听着  John  
Look, John...

192
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,028
我知道我这么对你是不对的
I know what I did to you was wrong.

193
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,028
你偷了我的肾
You stole my kidney.

194
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,041
我当时快要死了
I was dying.

195
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:53,061
你应该先问问我的
You could have asked me.

196
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,075
你想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me?

197
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,005
我假装死了是因为
I killed myself off because

198
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:08,085
外面有两个人想要我的命
there are two men who were going to beat me to it.

199
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:12,045
你做了什么  偷了他们的肝?
What did you do, steal their livers?

200
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:16,045
没有  我拿了他们七十万美元
No. I took them for 700,000 dollars.

201
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,068
退休前捞一笔
Retirement con.

202
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,028
我把钱放在一个保险箱里
I put the money in a safe deposit box,

203
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,088
但是那两个人很可能等在银行里
but these two guys might be sitting on the bank

204
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,075
看我是否会出现
to see if I show my face,

205
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:29,085
所以我才要你
which is why I need you to go in there

206
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:33,028
去那儿帮我把钱拿来
and get it for me.

207
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,091
你认为我是傻子?
Do you think I'm stupid?

208
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:45,081
我给你二十万
I want you to take 200 grand of it.

209
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,081
这弥补不了我对你的所作所为
It won't make up for what I did to you,

210
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:53,095
但我只能做这些了
but it's the best I can do.

211
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:57,031
我会在飞机场边上的旅馆
I'll be at the Flightline Motel,

212
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,081
一直等到明天下午

213
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,025
之后不管拿不拿的到钱 我都立马走人
And then I'm gone, money or no money.

214
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,075
还有  John 如果到那时你还没来...

我会理解的
I'll understand.

216
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,075
我们被困住了
We're locked in.

217
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,095
什么?
What?

218
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:33,041
这些玻璃门降下来了
These blast doors came down.

219
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,092
房间被封锁了  
The whole living area is sealed off.

220
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,078
我出不去了
I can't get out.

221
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:39,088
你试着拉过...
Did you try to pry...

222
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,071
是的  但我不能...
Yeah, but I couldn't...

223
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,065
也许...
Maybe...

224
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,045
也许如果我们两人...
Maybe if the two of us...

225
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,075
你要我帮你么?
You want me to help you?

226
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,038
是的
Yeah.

227
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:03,061
如果我真的帮你把这些门打开了
And if I do help you get these doors up...

228
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,068
你又会把我关回这里  是么?
then you're gonna lock me back in here, aren't you?

229
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,035
是的
That's right.

230
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,068
那么我要你保证  John
Then I'm going to need your word, John.

231
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,021
我要你保证你不会让你们的人
I'm gonna need your word that you won't let your people

232
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,095
伤害我
do anything to me.

233
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:28,071
如果你说的是实话
Well, if you're who you say you are,

234
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,038
你还有什么好担心的呢?
what are you worried about?

235
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,088
他们出事了
Things have happened to them,

236
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,041
根本不关我的事
things that I had nothing to do with.

237
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,085
但是除了我他们找不到人来出气
But they've got no one to blame,except for me.

238
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,091
气都撒到我头上了
So, I'm gonna need your word...

239
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:44,075
所以我要你保证你会保护我
that you'll protect me.

240
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,098
无论发生什么事
No matter what.

我和你一样坠落在这个岛上
And I crashed on this island just like you.

244
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:29,008
好吧  我保证
All right. You have my word.

245
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:38,055
伙计  你赢了
Dude, you got me.

你知道我的牌么  医生?

还有三个木瓜  叫牌还是认输

253
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,005
那么  就这样吧
Well, I guess that's it.

254
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,049
什么意思  就这样?
What do you mean, "it"?

255
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,069
Sawyer  你输光了
Sawyer, you're busted.

256
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,075
我全赢了  再让你去摘芒果

我有更多的芒果

我是说  作为儿子  
I mean, for his son,

309
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,045
你在他的葬礼上并没有太痛苦
you didn't look too shook up at his funeral.

310
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,012
你怎么敢这么说?
How dare you?

311
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,001
如果你知道那个男人是怎么对他的
If you had any idea what that man did to him,

312
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,006
那个狗娘养的... ...

我们是去送他的
We were there to get past him,

315
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:45,032
让他走  我们好开始自己的生活
to get on with our lives, to let him go.

316
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:50,005
好的  好的
OK, OK.

317
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,015
我们走前再问一件事
Just one thing before we go.

318
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,019
你的包里是什么  John?
What's in the bag, John?

319
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:04,045
工作文件之类的  我是个房屋勘探员
Work papers and stuff, I'm a home inspector.

320
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,065
介意我看一下么?
You mind if we take a look?

321
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,025
恩...
Well...

322
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:35,049

There you go.

谢谢你的咖啡  小姐
Thanks for the coffee, miss.

324
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,039
Helen  我很抱歉  你没事吧?
Helen, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

325
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:04,055
你是在骗他们么  John?
Were you lying to those men, John?

326
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:08,085
没有  我当时很害怕
No, I was scared.

327
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,069
我只是...
I was...

328
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,082
我只是很害怕
I was scared.

329
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,069
那么  你是在哪儿学的牌  医生?
So, where'd you learn to play cards, Doc?

330
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,065
埔开
Phuket.

331
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,009
你去泰国干吗?
What the hell were you doing in Thailand?

332
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:42,049
怎么  你以为我不知道埔开在哪儿么?
What, you don't think I know where Phuket is?

333
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:45,029
我是初中没有毕业
Just 'cause I dropped out of ninth grade

334
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:48,012
可我不是傻子
don't make me an idiot.

在远东吧  是么?
Far East, huh?

336
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,075
看不出来你是出过远门的人
I wouldn't have taken you for a world traveler.

337
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:54,085
你在那儿刺的文身吗?
That where you got the art on your shoulder?

338
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:59,009
你再发一次牌吧?
How about you deal again?

339
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:00,069
什么?
What?

340
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:05,015

This time from the top of the deck.

What does it do?

343
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,042
我们还不清楚
We're not exactly sure.

344
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,012

108分钟就按一次按钮  是的
Every 108 minutes, yeah.

很快  所以我要你
Very... Which is why I need you to go up

348
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:35,022
从格栅爬进通风口

格栅上锁了  我试过的
Grate's bolted shut. I tried.

350
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,095
是的  食品室还有一个格栅
Yeah. There's another grate in the pantry.

351
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,082

一旦你到那儿  
Once you're inside,

00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,055
会听到警报声
you'll hear the alarm beeping.

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,079
然后你就得输入密码
And you just have to enter the numbers:

361
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,029

当心
Be careful.

371
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:52,082
Henry

372
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,095
Henry

373
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:15,022

Jack和Sawyer终于要开始一决胜负了

377
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,059
再加一瓶羟氨苄青霉素
and raise you a bottle of Amoxicillin.

378
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:32,075
你知道羟氨苄青霉素是什么吗?
Do you even know what Amoxicillin is?

379
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,038
你可能去过埔开  医生 
You may have been to Phuket, Doc,

380

但我去过塔拉哈西

381
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,055
看来什么东西热起来了
Let's just say something was burning

382
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,055
这可不是因为阳光的原因
and it wasn't from the sunshine.

383
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:51,015
我全压了
I'm all in.

384
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,019
看来你是想让我放弃
Well, that's the move of a man who wants me to lay it down.

385
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,052
你是不会放弃的
You're not gonna lay it down.

386
00:28:57,055 --> 00:29:01,029
我不会?  为什么不会?
I'm not, huh?  Why's that?

387
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,055
因为现在有一帮人在看我们
Because there's a bunch of people watching us right now.

388
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:10,005
你不想让他们看到你再输

389
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:20,012
恩  好的  我跟了

00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,089
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

我过会儿去拿药
I'll come get the meds later.

397
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,042
当我问你你要赌什么时
When I asked you what you wanted for stakes,

398
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:54,062
你为什么不说要赌枪?
why didn't you ask for the guns?

399
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,022
当我要枪的时候...
When I need the guns...

400

我就会拿到枪的

听我说  你必须爬到通风口
Listen to me, you have to get up into the vents

407

我想有根管子破了
I guess we got a cracked pipe,

490
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:46,061
但是要找到原因还得再过一段时间

我正要爬回通风口
I was just climbing back into the vent

515
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:58,094

你的意思是这都是巧合?
You think it was all just random?
