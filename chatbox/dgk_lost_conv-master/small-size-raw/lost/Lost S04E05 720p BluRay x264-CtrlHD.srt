Faraday给我画的草图
Cheat sheet faraday drew for me.

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,052
你不知道你们的船在哪?
You don't know where your boat is?

00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,029
我知道
I know where it is.

5
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:52,099
那为什么你径直的朝雷暴云的地方飞
Why are you flying directly into the thunderhead?

6
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:57,052
你就不能安稳的坐着  让我自己搞定吗
Why don't you just sit back and let me do my job, huh?

7
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,032
她就是Penelope?
Is that penelope?

8
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:10,029
她给Charlie说她不知道这艘船  是吗
She told charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct?

00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:11,082
对

Did you not hear me?

00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:07,082
抱歉长官  我...  我刚才做梦了
I'm sorry, sir. I was-- I was having a dream, sir.

你做梦了?!
You were having a dream, were you?

20
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,052
你梦见什么了
And what were you dreaming about?

00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:15,095
让你慢吞吞的准备好
That it took you so sodding long to get to your mark?!

22
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,072
我梦见自己在一架直升飞机上  长官
I was in a helicopter, sir,

23
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,022
风暴来袭  长官
And there was a storm, sir.

24
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,095
还有...
And...

25
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:27,038
我不记得其他的了  长官
I don't remember the rest, sir.

26
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:31,068
至少还是个他妈的关于军队的梦
Well, at least it was a bloody military dream.

27

从没有过如此真实的梦
I've never had a dream that was so vivid.

40
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,089
就好象...好象我真的在那
It was--it was like I was actually there.

41
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,057
你要发表什么意见吗  Hume?

42
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,077
我在问你话!
I asked you a question!

We're almost through it.

我看到阳光了

Desmond  你还好吧?
Desmond, are you all right?

来
Here you go.

53
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,001
好吧  他们一天前走的
All right, they took off a day ago.

54
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,001
为什么到现在还没有消息
Why haven't we heard from 'em?

55
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,051
我再给你说一遍
I'm gonna tell you again,

56
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:10,011
医生  一晚上我都给你说了我也不知道啊
As I've been telling you all night, doctor, I don't know!

57
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,021
我给船上通话的内容你也听到了
You heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat.

58
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:16,038
-你凭什么认为我知道些什么  -因为你不担心
What makes you think I know anything? because you're not worried.

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,001
什么?
Excuse me?

60
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,001
你们的船离这里40英里
Your boat's 40 miles off the coast.

61
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,001
只用花20分钟就到了
It should've taken 'em, what, 20 minutes to get there?

62
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:26,048
-你为什么一点也不担心  -那我是不是应该
So why aren't you worried? well, should I wring my hands together

63
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,034
双手祈祷他们不要出事呢
And whisper a prayer on their behalf?

64
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,034
别这样
Hey, hey, hey. come on.

65
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,018
要不我们...直接告诉他们
Maybe we should just-- just tell 'em.

66
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,031
告诉我们什么
Tell us what?

67
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:40,021
Dan...别让他们更晕了
Dan... let's not confuse anyone.

68
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:44,044
Daniel  也许你讲慢一点
Well... daniel, maybe if you talk real slow,

69
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,068
我们能听懂
We'll be able to follow.

70
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:54,068
你们所感知的你们朋友离开了多久
Your perception of how long your friends have been gone...

71
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:59,018
其实并不是他们实际就离开了那么久
It's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone.

72
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,044
什么意思
What does that mean?

73
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,038
就不该这样
This is a mistake.

74
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,051
没事的
It'll be fine. it'll be fine.

75
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:09,051
Frank只要按照我给他的方位图飞行
As long as frank flew on the bearings that I gave him,

76
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:12,008
他按照那个来飞行的话...就会没事
If he stayed on it, it... it'll be fine.

77
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,004
如果他没有呢
And what if he didn't?

78
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:19,004
那可能就会出现些副作用
Then there might be side effects.

79
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:23,061
-我们在2000英尺的高空  坐好了  -我在这干嘛
We're at 2,000 feet. sit down! what am I doing here?!

80
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,011
-到底是怎么了  -Desmond有点不对劲
What the hell's going on?! something's wrong with desmond.

-我不是在做吗  -让我离开
I'm trying! let go of me!

83
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,028
别让他碰着操纵杆了  我们还有两分钟到达
Keep him away from the stick! we'll be there in two minutes!

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,011

00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,034
大洋航班815的幸存者
Survivors of 815.

86
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,032
你把他们带到这里  你到底在想什么?
So you brought them here. what the hell were you thinking?

87
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:31,028
我在哪?
Where--where am i?

88
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,068
-好了  放松  -你们是谁

what am I doing here? who are you people? my friend is disoriented.

91
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,064
我不是你的朋友  我根本不认识你
Look, I'm not your friend! I don't know you!

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,018
他什么时候开始这样的
when did he start doing this?

93
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,061
我们起飞的时候还好好的  当遇见暴风时...
He was fine when we took off. when we hit some weather--

94
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,078
Faraday告诉我只要按照他的方向
Hey, faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector

95
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,051

Down to the sick bay, okay?

99
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,024
-我和他一起  -让我们的医生先照顾他吧
I'm going with him. let our doctor look at him first,

100
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:05,024
然后你再下来也行
Then you can come down.

101
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:07,054
我答应你  好吗
You got my word on that, okay?

102
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,007
听着  这一定是哪里弄错了

00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,054
不  这一定是弄错了
No, but this is wrong!

106

00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,001
"这"什么
"here" what?

110
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,078
你在那站着干嘛
What the hell are you doing on your feet?

111
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,038
做完仰卧起坐了?
Are you finished with your crunches

112

你想跑步了?
Because you want to run?!

我告诉你的话  你一定认为我疯了

我已经认为你疯了
I already know you're crazy.

122
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,024
今天早晨
This morning,

123
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:12,051
当我在操场做仰卧起坐的时候
When I was in the yard doing crunches...

我离开了
I left.

125
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,054
什么意思  你离开了?
What do you mean, you left?

126
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:23,031
我在一艘船上
I was on a boat.

00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,028
然后又回来了  就在开始的地方
And then--then I was back here, right--right where I started.

181
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:13,014

但是有些人离开或来到这个岛
But going to and coming from the island,

187
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:33,093
就会感觉...有点困惑
Some people can get a little... confused.

...不仅仅是原创的思想
...not a single piece of original thinking...

292
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,061
原创的概念是...
The concept of "original"--

293
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,005
就是派生的反义词
The opposite of derivative.

294
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,062
我是来给你留下印象的  Hollister先生
I am the one for you to impress, Mr. Hollister,

295
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,024
-我没印象  -那就再去试试
And I'm not impressed. so go. go try again.

296
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,005
抱歉  请问你是Daniel Faraday吗
Um, sorry, are--are you Daniel Faraday?

297
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,068
你是?
You are?

298
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,076
抱歉  我是  我是Desmond Hume
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm--i'm Desmond Hume, and, uh,

299
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,033
别人给我讲在这能找到你
I was told I could find you here.

300
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,010
我想我...
And I think I've...

301
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,037
我刚到过未来
I've just been to the future.

302
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,081
-未来?  -是的
The future? yes.

303
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,043
我在那和你说话
Uh, i-i spoke to you there.

304
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:39,074
你告诉我到这  牛津
You, uh, you told me to come here to--to oxford

305
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,020
你说  你可以帮我
You--you said you'd help me.

306
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,013
为什么我在未来不帮助你呢
Why didn't I just help you there in the future?

307
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,071
为什么我要把你送上时间旅行
Why would I put you through the headache of time traveling?

308
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,033
你知道我的意思吗
You--you know what I mean?

309
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,017
就感觉有点多此一举
It just seems a little... unnecessary?

310
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,043
你以为我那些受尊敬的同僚们
And don't you think my esteemed colleagues

311
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,036
会因为一点点的相信
Could've come up with something

312
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,068
而来找我吗
Just a little more believable, huh?

313
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:07,008
又是什么恶作剧?  时间上自相矛盾  毫无创见
What kind of a prank is that? time paradox--so uninspired.

314
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,076
把你的设备...设置到2.342
Set your device to, um... 2.342

315
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,013
然后确定振荡在11赫兹
And--and make sure it oscillates at 11.

316
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,015
好吧  你...
Okay, now--now you...

317
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,027
你告诉我是谁告诉你那些数字的
You're gonna tell me who told you those numbers.

318
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,014
是你
You did.

319
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,074
不可能  这完全是荒谬可笑的
No, this is... this is ridiculous.

320
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,073
我知道埃勒维兹
I know about Eloise.

321
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,039
这些到底是什么
What--what is all this?

322
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:53,015
这就是我做令牛津不舒服的事情的地方
This is where I do the things oxford frowns upon.

323
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,081
好  那么未来的我
All right, this... this future version of me,

324
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:01,037
提到了我们这次会面  对吗?  一定提到过  
Uh, he--he referenced this meeting, right? obviously.

325
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,002
所以我一定会记得你来过这里  是吧
So--so I would remember you coming to oxford, right?

326
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,090
我会记得这件事情  在此时此刻
I would remember this, here, right now.

327
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,078
实际上你不记得
Actually, um, no.

328
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,085
-不记得了?  -也许你就是忘了
No? maybe you just forgot.

329
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,091
说的对  这怎么可能发生过?
Yeah, right. how would that happen?

330
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,077
那么你现在要改变未来?
So this--this is changing the future?

331
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:20,071
你不可能改变未来
You can't change the future.

332
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:23,057
-那是干嘛的?  -防辐射
What's that for? radiation.

333
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,019
-我也要穿吗?  -你不需要
Do I get one? you don't need one.

334
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,025
穿它是为了防护过量辐射  我每天要做20次
For prolonged exposure. i-i do this 20 times a day.

335
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,038
你不用戴什么保护头吗
So what do you put on your head?

336
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,006
是的
Yeah.

337
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:45,074
这个
This...

338
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,007
它是Eloise
This is Eloise.

339
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,019
你这是在做什么
What does this do?

340
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:02,097
这  如果你给我的数字是正确的
This... if the numbers you gave me are correct,

341
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,024
这将使Eloise
What this will do...

342
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,074
摆脱连续时空的限制
Is unstick Eloise in time,

343
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,037
就像你一样
Just like you.

344
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,027
发生了什么
What happened?

345
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,022
等等 别说话  她还没醒过来
Wait, shh, shh. she's not back yet.

346
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:38,041
好的  就看马上会有什么结果
Okay, here goes... everything.

347
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:42,032
动起来  动起来 
Come on, come on. come on.

348
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,002
对了
That's it.

349
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,039
对了  这就对了
That's it. that's it.

350
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,050
好  好
Yes, yes.

351
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:03,089
成功了!
It worked!

352
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,028
-这太不可思议了  -抱歉  等一下
Th-this is incredible. I'm sorry.

353
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,062
一只老鼠能跑出你这破迷宫有什么稀奇?
How is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?

354
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,064
不可思议的是
What is incredible

355
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,091
我今天早上刚做的这个迷宫
Is I just finished the maze this morning,

356
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,095
我原打算到从现在开始的一小时后
And I'm not gonna teach her how to run it

357
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,082
才教她怎么跑过这个迷宫
Until an hour from now.

358
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,012
这么说你刚才把它送到了未来
S-so--so you--you sent her to the future.

359
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,033
不  只是她的意识  思想
No, no, no, her consciousness, her mind.

360
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,038
这对我有什么帮助
So-- so how does that help me?

361
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:38,063
你?  帮助你?
You? help you?

362
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,043
我不明白  是我应该帮助你吗?
I don't understand. am I supposed to help you?

363
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,093
-难道我不是把你送回这里来帮助我吗  -我不知道你为什么让我来这
Didn't I send you back here to help me? I don't know why you sent me here.

364
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,086
我所知道的只有
All I know about you is you--

365
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,069
你最后困在了一个可怕的岛上
You end up on some bloody island.

366
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,078
什么岛?  为什么我会在一个岛上
What island? w-why would I go to an i--

367
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,001
Desmond  把电话给我
Desmond, give me the phone.

368
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,003
都怎么了  大家冷静一点!
Hey, come on! everybody relax!

369
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,030
听着  Daniel要给那个人打电话
Listen, look, Daniel wanted to talk to the guy,

370
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:02,061
-我们就把电话给他了  就是这样  -你让Faraday和他说话了?
So we brought him the phone, that's all. you let Faraday talk to him?

371
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,093
-他说他能帮上忙  -Faraday连自己都帮不了!
He said he could help. faraday can't even help himself!

372
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:08,071
出去  船长要跟你谈话
Outside now. the captain wants to talk to you.

373
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,076
-我也要跟你们船长谈一谈  -我一定会告诉他的
And I want to talk to your captain. I'll be sure to let him know.

374
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,043
还有  你们老老实实坐着
In the meantime, have a seat.

375
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,068
-去哪  那个岛?  -他说能帮得上忙
Back where? the island? he said he could help.

376
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,081
-他说他会告诉我需要去做什么  -Desmond  Desmond      
He said he--he'd tell me what I needed to do. Desmond, Desmond,

377
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,035
你能给我解释一下
Can you please explain to me--

378
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,023
Desmond?
Desmond?

379
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,005
你叫Desmond?
You're Desmond?

380
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,075
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

381
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,041
我是George Minkowski
I'm George Minkowski.

382
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,076
我是信号联络负责人
I'm the communications officer.

383
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,070
在他们把我绑在这之前
Before they strapped me down here,

384
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:46,049
我在信号室负责调度这艘船
All the calls to and from this boat came through me

385
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,067
所有的电信联络
In the radio room.

386
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,011
我经常
And every so often,

387
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:55,012
能看到信号灯在我的控制台上闪烁
I'd get this flashing light on my console--

388
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,031
有一个电话打进来
An incoming call.

389
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,079
我们被严令不许接听那个电话
We were under strict orders never to answer it.

390
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,058
那么你说的和我有什么关系
So? what's that got to do with me?

391
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:07,015
是你女朋友打来的
Those calls came from your girlfriend.

392
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,077
Penelope Widmore
Penelope widmore.

393
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,047
发生了什么事
What happened?

394
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,010
你醒了
Oh, uh, you're back.

395
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:29,063
你刚刚昏迷了大约有75分钟
And... you were out almost 75 minutes.

396
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:33,000
是的
Oh, yeah. yeah, yeah. you just... whew.

397
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,036
你刚说话的时候突然就摊在了地上
You went catatonic right in the middle of a sentence.

398
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,071
我只好把你扶到椅子上
I had to carry you to the chair.

399
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:40,084
-我想你刚才又回到了未来  -是吧
So I take it you were-- you were in the future again? aye.

400
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:44,007
-多长时间  -我不知道  五分钟?    
For how long? I don't know. five minutes?

401
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,064
为什么这种情况总在发生
Why does this keep happening?

402
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,016
我猜想你的请况
Uh, in your case,

403
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:52,093
应该症状呈指数级加重
I'm guessing the progression is exponential.

404
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:55,051
每一次你的意识穿梭时空
Each time your consciousness jumps,

405
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:57,066
都会变得更难以回到初始状态
It gets harder and harder to jump back.

406
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:01,011
如果我是你的话  过马路一定小心翼翼
I would be careful crossing the street if I were you.

407
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:11,019
她怎么了  死了
What happened to her? she died.

408
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:14,028
-我知道她死了  怎么死的?  -也许是脑动脉瘤  我还不确定  
Yeah, I can see that. how? brain aneurysm, probably. I don't know.

409
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,080
我待会给她验尸
I'm going to do an autopsy later.

410
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,040
我也会死吗
Is that gonna happen to me?

411
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:21,049
不同的个体受到的影响应该会有区别  但是
The effects seem to vary from case to case, but, uh...

412
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:23,008
快告诉我!
Answer me!

413
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,038
如果这种状况持续下去  我会不会死掉
If this keeps happening, am I gonna die?

414
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,059
我想
I think...

415
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:38,092
Eloise是脑梗阻
Eloise's brain short-circuited.

416
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,078
在现在和未来之间的频繁穿梭
The jumps between the present and the future--

417
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,059
她最终不能分辨出现在和未来
She eventually--she couldn't tell which was which.

418
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,022
-她没有能支撑自己穿梭时空的东西  -什么是anchor
She had no anchor. wh-what do you mean, "anchor"?

419
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,056
可以将两个时点联系起来的东西
Something familiar in both times.

420
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,083
所有这些  看到了吗  它们都是变量
All this--see this? this is all variables.

421
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:54,042
随机的  混乱的
It's random. it's chaotic.

422
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:57,025
所有的方程都需要稳定性  一些已知量
Every equation needs stability, something known.

423
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,039
就是常量
It's called a constant.

424
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,069
Desmond  你没有常量
Desmond, you have no constant.

425
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:04,026
当你穿梭到了未来  你对熟悉所有的事物都不熟悉
When you go to the future, nothing there is familiar.

426
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:06,073
如果你想阻止它再次发生
So if you want to stop this,

427
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:10,030
就要在未来找一样你珍视的事物
Y--then you need to find something there,

428
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:14,030
它一直深藏在你的内心深处
Something that you really, really care about...

429
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,069
同时存在于现在这个时点
That also exists back here...

430
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:20,008
1996年
In 1996.

431
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,049
这个常量
This constant...

432
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,097
它可以是一个人吗
Can it be a person?

433
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:30,087
对  可以
Yeah, maybe.

434
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:33,075
但你一定要和这个人取得联系
But you have to make some kind of contact.

435
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,048
你刚才不是说你在一艘
Didn't you say you were

436
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:38,036
不知道在什么方位的船上吗
Off on a boat in the middle of nowhere?

437
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,022
你在给谁打电话
Uh... who are you calling?

438
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,082
我在给我珍惜的常量
I'm calling my bloody constant.

439
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,078
你所拨打的号码

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,097
无法接通

441
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,022
你还好吗
You okay?

442
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,000
你看上去老了不少  是吧
You look a lot older now, huh?

443

欢迎回来  Desmond

444
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,065
-我要给Penny打电话  -给你女朋友打电话可不是当务之急
I need to call Penny. calling your girlfriend is not our priority.

445
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:16,092
听着兄弟  我不大认识你  但
Listen, brother, I don't know you, but--

446
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,001
你貌似认识我
But you seem to know me,

447
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,092
如果我和你是朋友

448
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:24,054
那么我需要你的帮助  我现在就要给Penny打电话

449
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:27,031
小伙子们  你们可根本没弄清楚情况
Whoa! you boys are gettin' way ahead of yourselves.

450
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:29,091
两天前  有个人毁掉了所有的设备

451
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,021
我们与陆地失去了所有的联系
We lost all communication with the mainland.

452
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:37,046
我当时有可能修好它  但后来
I probably could've fixed it, but then...

453
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,060
我成了疯子
Then I went nuts.

454
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:39,071
信号室在哪儿
Where's the radio room?

455

在上面一层  我带你们去  快点

我们怎么才能离开这儿

457
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:49,073
门开了
Through the door.

458
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:57,007
貌似你俩在这船上还有朋友
Looks like you guys have a-a friend on this boat.

459
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:17,020
现在没人

466
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,032
它是七年后在马达加斯加岛的

467
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:55,093
海盗船的遗物中被发现

日记的内容从来没有被公开过

我要和Penny联系

我不知道如何联系她

她的号码已经无效了

498
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,098
曾经有段时间  如果你向她求婚的话

Fortunately...

00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,025
你的怯懦赢得了上风

502

我将此视为你又改变主意了

你希望她能再给你一次机会

为什么你这么恨我?

00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:51,003
恨你的不是我
It's not me who hates you.

00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,035
这是她的地址

让她自己告诉你吧
I'll let her tell you herself.

00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,038
喂  这怎么会发生在你身上的?

513
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:40,042
我们在此下锚  等待命令
We were anchored here, waiting for our orders,

514
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,035
闷得要命
Bored out of our minds.

515
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:46,013
Brandon和我  他是其中一名船员
Me and brandon-- he's one of the crew members--

516
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,011
我们...我们驾着交通船
We--we took out the ship's tender.

517
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,061
我们就是想看看这个岛
We just wanted to see the island.

518
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,069
但是Brandon开始发疯
But brandon started acting crazy,

519
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,039
所以我们只能回返
So we had to turn around.

520
00:32:58,072 --> 00:33:00,057
他在哪里?  运尸袋里
Where is he? in a body bag.

521
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,014
那里
There.

522
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,038
谁干的?
Who did this?

523
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:13,014
这可问住我了
You got me.

524
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,077
但当船长发现的时候  我感觉很抱歉...
But when the captain finds out, I feel sor--

525
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,054
你打完电话后  最好有人能告诉我
After your call, someone has to tell me

526
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:23,096
到底是怎么回事
Precisely what is going on.

527
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,038
兄弟  你能修好吗?
Can you fix it, brother?

528
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,006
需要一点时间
I need a minute.

你有号码?
Do you have the number to make the call?

-不记得  -你最好能记住它

现在是2004年
It's 2004.

535
