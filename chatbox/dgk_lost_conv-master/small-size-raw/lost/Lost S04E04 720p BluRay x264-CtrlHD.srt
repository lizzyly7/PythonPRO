00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,032
这是最后的两个蛋了
These are the last two eggs.

5
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,069
从我书架上拿来的?
From my own bookshelf?

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,055
-帮你打发一下时间  -这本我都看过了
Help you pass the time. I've already read it.

7
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,055
看第二遍可以让你温故知新
You might catch something you missed the second time around.

8
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,045
你为什么要把我从关押室转到这里来?
Why did you move me from the rec room down here?

9
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,085
我想让你呆在我眼皮底下
I wanted you under my own roof.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,055
你把其他人关在哪儿?  Miles 是叫这个名字吧
Where are you keeping your other prisoner? miles, is it?

11
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:32,055
看来你不想告诉我
Oh, you don't want to share.

12
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,082
事实上  Ben  我倒是希望你能告诉我点什么
Actually, I was hoping you would share, ben,

13
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:37,085
既然你都说了在船上有个内线

14

John  我真同情你

发自内心的同情你

17

找不到想要的答案
You couldn't find the cabin.

18
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,035
你没法感受到Jacob
You can't make contact with jacob.

19
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,092
你如此绝望的想知道下一步该怎么做
You're so desperate to figure out what to do next,

20
00:01:57,092 --> 00:02:00,089
你甚至现在都问到我头上来了
You're even asking me for help.

21
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:06,082
既然这样  还是像从前那样
So here we are, just like old times...

22
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,035
你把我换到另外的房间去
Except I'm locked in a different room.

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,099
不然你只会更郁闷
And you're more lost than you ever were.

24
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,012
我知道你有什么企图
I know what you're trying to do.

25
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,079
没用的
It's not gonna work.

26
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:21,089
不错嘛  John  你变机灵了
Excellent, john. you're evolving.

27
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:24,005
早饭吃完了吧
Done with your breakfast?

28
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,025
那是怎么回事?
What's that all about?

29
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,079
谁知道呢  Locke就这样的

好吧  我去给你倒一杯
Well... why don't I go make you a cup?

35
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:15,042
感觉有点怪吧  不是吗
Kinda weird, ain't it?

36
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,092
悠闲的坐在前廊  一杯杯喝咖啡
Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs.

37
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,075
我找到一些你可以穿的衣服

38
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,095
挂在一个衣橱里面的
Hung 'em in a closet.

39
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,082
那么在我赶走Hugo之后

James  我不会和你一起住的
I'm not moving in with you, james.

41
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,049
好吧  那你干嘛留下来
Well... then why did you stay?

42
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:33,089
这不关你的事
That's none of your business.

43
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:36,062
你是不是有个什么秘密计划?
Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh?

44
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,089
要是你帮Jack做内线的话
Well, if you're spying for jack-

45
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:41,013
-我没有替任何人做内线  -那你干嘛不告诉我...
I'm not spying for anyone. so why don't you tell me-

46
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,069
因为我不相信你
Because I don't trust you.

47
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,045
看来是跟怀孕的事有关
This is about the pregnancy thing.

48
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,015
James...
James...

49
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,042

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,076
你要的是谁
Who?

155
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,029
你觉得还能是谁呢
Who do you think?

156
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,026
你还好吧
You okay?

157
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,016
我还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

158
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:58,052
听着  地区检察官要亲自做这个案子
Listen, the d.a.'s decided to try this case herself,

159
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,016
这就意味着他们会全力以赴
Which means they're gonna do the full court press,

160
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:03,086
我们就得想法庭外调解
And we need to start talking about cutting a deal.

161
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,066
怎么个调解
What kind of deal?

162
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,046
老实说  据我最乐观的估计
Honestly, my best guess,

163
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,092
可能她会判你个15年
I'd say she'll take a 15-year sentence,

164
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:11,017
你服刑到第7年可以申请假释
And you serve seven.

165
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:13,036
没门
No way.

166
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,096
Kate 如果你的案子庭审的话
If you go to trial, kate,

167
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:17,043
每项罪名都会让你关上个20年
You're looking at 20 years on each count,

168
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:20,013
-更别说你那项谋杀罪名就得判个终身监禁 -不行
Not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge. no.

169
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,090
Kate  你都向你妈亲口供认
Kate, you confessed to your mother

170
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,023
是你杀害了你父亲
That you killed your father,

171
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:26,046
现在她成了有力的人证
And now she's their star witness.

172
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,010
那你来告诉我  我该怎么办
So you tell me- what am I supposed to do?

173
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,046
-我要怎么才能赢这场官司  -带我上法庭吧
How am I supposed to win this thing? put me on the stand.

174
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:34,036
然后期望地区检察官放你一马?  不可能的
And take a chance with the d. a. crossing you? no.

175
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,046
依我之见  我们可以博一把
Way I see it, we've got one shot at this.

176
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,093
-是什么  -我们在身份上做文章
What's that? we make it about character,

177
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,053
不去纠结于你做过或没做过这些
Not about what you did or didn't do,

178
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,053
而在于你是什么人
But about who you are.

179
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:48,000
什么意思  我是什么人?
What do you mean, who I am?

180
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,096
我想让他出席法庭
I want him in the courtroom.

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,003
-绝对不行  -Kate  我们需要他去
Absolutely not. we need him, kate.

182
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,016
这会带来极大的同情关注
It'll generate tremendous sympathy.

183
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:58,019
Duncan  听我说  你不能把他带过去
Duncan, listen to me. you are not bringing him in here.

184
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,039
好吧,你想这么做这案子,关于我的身份？可以
All right, you wanna make this about me, about my character? Fine

185
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,069
但你就是不能利用我儿子
But you are not using my son.

186
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,094
或许我们还可以试着
Maybe we should try a number

187
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,031
打一打除了那船以外的号码  比如说911
Other than the boat, like... 9-1-1.

188
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,018
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

189
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,054
没事
Nothing.

190
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:25,078
就是跟那船的联系出了点问题
We're just having some trouble getting ahold of their boat.

191
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,001
你还没有Sayid的消息吗  你说他们昨天就走了
You haven't heard from sayid? you said they left yesterday.

192
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,088
我确定他们应该没事
And I'm sure they're fine.

193
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,091
万一Locke是对的呢
What if locke was right?

194
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:37,018
万一这些人真的是来伤害我们的?
What if these people are here to hurt us?

195
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,051
Locke做事情没理智的
Locke has no idea what he's doing.

196
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,015
那为什么Kate留在他那边?
Then why is kate with him?

197
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,025
你确定他把Ben关在地下室吗
You sure he's got ben in his basement?

198
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,051
恩  我看到Rousseau昨晚把他带过去的
Uh-huh. I saw rousseau take him in there last night.

199
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:01,065
-Locke出去过吗   -没有  他整天在里面烧菜弄饭
Does locke ever go out? no. he's been in there cooking all day.

200
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,078
他邀请我们大家去晚餐
He invited us all over for dinner.

201
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,051
你能帮我带一下Aaron吗
Oh, can you get aaron for me?

202
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,061
就是把他抱起来  轻轻的摇摇拍拍
Just pick him up and rock him a little bit.

203
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:20,045
我有点不大擅长和婴儿打交道
Yeah, I'm just... not very good with babies.

204
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,048
我不想把他弄得更不舒服
I wouldn't want him to get more upset.

205
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,041
好吧  我来抱他
Here, I got him.

206
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,018
没事的
It's okay.

207
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,015
小宝贝  到这儿来
Here we go, muffin.

208
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,038
对了  抱住你了
Yeah. there we go.

209
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,098
你真会带他
You're so good with him.

210
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,001
是吗
What?

211
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,051
我从没想过
Just the last thing

212
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:48,071
自己能够当个好妈妈
I ever thought I'd be good at is being a mum.

213
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:51,055
你知道  有时你得试着去做
You know, you should try it sometime.

214
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,061
Aaron  别哭了  亲爱的
Hey, aaron. come on, sweetie.

215
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,065
请起身
Please rise.

216
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:06,045
现在开庭  请就座
Court is now in session. please be seated.

217
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,059
不要怪我  好吗
Don't fire me, okay?

218
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,095
什么
What?

219
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,079
一开始你就败仗阵来  我必须这样做
We got killed in the opening. I had to do this.

220
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,082
被告有证人没有
Does the defense have a witness?

221
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,032
是的  有  法官大人
Yes, we do, your honor.

222
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,072
被告传召Jack Shephard医生
The defense calls dr. jack shephard

223
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:27,039
到证人席
To the witness stand.

224
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,039
法官大人  基于他们的关系
Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness

225
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,015
我重申反对传唤这为证人
On the basis of relevance.

226
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,019
反对无效
And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection.

227
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,045
你们知道  该证人
You are to be aware that this witness

228
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,045
在被告被控告有罪后
Did not meet the defendant

229
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,089
才认识的
Until after the alleged crimes she is being charged with.

230
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,079
他只能视为被告的品德信誉见证人
He's to be viewed as a character witness only.

231
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,015
请继续
Proceed.

232
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,005
请举起右手
Please raise your right hand.

233
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,069
你能向上帝发誓你所说的话
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

234
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:04,052
-全部是事实吗?  -是的
And nothing but the truth so help you god? yes.

235
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,049
Shephard医生
Dr. shephard...

236
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:15,049
你能告诉陪审团
Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury-

237
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,059
你们之中谁没有读过报纸
If there are any of you who don't read newspapers

238
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,085
上过网或看过电视...
Or the internet or watch television...

239
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,032
你是怎样认识被告的
How you met the defendant?

240
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:25,042
在2004年9月22日
On september 22, 2004,

241
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,075
Kate...
Kate...

242
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,049
我和Austen小姐
Miss austen and i

243
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,085
是大洋815航班的乘客
Were both passengers on oceanic flight 815,

244
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,072
该飞机坠毁在南太平洋一个岛上
Which crash-landed on an island in the south pacific.

245
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:39,022
你知道Austen小姐是一名逃亡者吗?
Were you aware that miss austen was a fugitive

246
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,072
知道她由一名美国执行官押送
Being transported by a united states marshal

247
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:45,062
-乘座飞机到洛杉矶接受审讯吗?  -是的  我知道
On that flight to los angeles for trial? I did learn that eventually, yes.

248
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,012
是从美国执行官那得知的吗?
From the u.s. marshal?

249
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,039
不是  执行官在坠毁中死了
No, the marshal died in the crash.

250
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,079
我从来没有和他说过话
Uh, I never spoke to him.

251
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,075
Austen告诉我的
Miss austen told me.

252
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,084
-你是否问过她她到底有罪没有?  -没有
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty? no. never.

253
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:05,001
似乎还是个合情理的问题  为什么
Well, it seems like a reasonable question. why not?

254
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,085
我觉得肯定是有一些误会
I just assumed that there'd been some kind of mistake.

255
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,002
你为什么这样认为
And why would you think that?

256
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,042
飞机坠毁后只有我们八人生还
Only eight of us survived the crash.

257
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,085
我们掉在水里
We landed in the water.

258
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,089
我伤得很重
I was hurt pretty badly.

259
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:21,075
事实上  要不是她的话
In fact, if it weren't for her,

260
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,025
我肯定上不了岸
I would have never made it to the shore.

261
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,052
她照顾我们  照顾我们所有人
She took care of me. she took care of all of us.

262
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:28,019
她给我们急救
She--she gave us first aid,

263
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:31,075
给我们找水和食物  建庇护所
Water, found food, made shelter.

264
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,071
她试图救另外两个  但是他们没有...
She tried to save the other two, but they didn't--

265
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,049
别说了
Stop.

266
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:38,092
Austen女士  请坐下
Miss austen, please sit down.

267
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:42,022
这和...和这些事没关系
This has nothing to do with... with anything.

268
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,079
这是我的审判
This is my trial,

269
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:48,005
我不想他说与此无关的事
And I don't want him to say anything else.

270
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,082
好了  我没有问题了  法官大人
It's fine. I have no more questions, your honor.

271
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,067
Dunbrook女士
Miss dunbrook,

272
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,032
到你发问
Your witness.

273
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,059
这真让人感动  Shephard医生
That was very moving, dr. shephard.

274
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,082
我只问你一个问题
I only have one question for you--

275
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:09,040
-你爱被告吗  -反对
Do you love the defendant? objection.

276
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,001
Forrester  是你开了先河
You opened this door, mr. forrester.

277
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,086
我允许问这个问题
I'm going to allow it.

278
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,044
Shephard医生
Dr. shephard?

279
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:21,019
你爱Austen女士吗
Do you love miss austen?

280
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,053
不爱
No.

281
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,016
不再爱了
Not anymore.

282
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,042
那么  你想看什么
So... what do you want to watch--

283
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,098
世外桃源或撒旦死亡记?
Xanadu or "satan's doom"?

284
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,054
我在看书
I'm reading.

285
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,085
把那玩意儿关小点  妈的
Turn that thing down, damn it.

286
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,093
抱歉
Sorry.

287
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:02,080
-嘿  -我能进来吗
Hey. can I come in?

288
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,096
当然可以
Sure.

289
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,072
-我敢肯定你认识我的室友  -你好  Hurley
I believe you know my roommate. hi, hurley.

290
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,006
你好  Kate
Hey, kate.

291
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,073
你眼睛进东西了吗  Hugo
Got somethin' in your eye, hugo?

292
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,057
我们不如到厨房谈吧
Why don't we talk in the kitchen?

293
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,043
我知道尽管是在盒子里  但是
I know it's in a box, but, uh...

294
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,035
真的是他妈的好酒
It's pretty damn good wine.

295
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,002
我尝过了
I tested it.

296
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,012
和Claire住在一起感觉怎样
So how's the life at casa de claire?

297
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,071
Aaron是不是吵得你整夜睡不着?
Baby aaron keeping you up all night?

298
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:39,024
-不  他睡得很熟  -那很好啊
No. no, he's a good sleeper. good for you.

299
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,034
你真行  雀斑女
You are terrible at this, freckles.

300
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,048
你说过你不是为我而留下来的
You already said you didn't stay behind for me.

301
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,013
至少你得够女人味
So at least be woman enough

302
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,089
来告诉我你要利用我做什么
To tell me you wanna use me for somethin'.

303
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,030
我想你帮我
I wanna use you for somethin'.

304
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:07,002
瞧  没那么难吧
See? wasn't that hard.

305
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,012
干什么
For what?

306
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,065
把Ben弄出来
For ben.

307
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,075
我想你帮我把Ben弄出来
I want you to help me bust him out.

308
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,078
想玩玩西洋双陆棋吗

309
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,076
好啊
You're on.

310
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,054
我不确定自己的所作所为
Do you think I know what I'm doing?

311
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:40,059
你...
Do you...

312
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,090
后悔跟我一起到这儿?
Regret following me out here,

313
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,047
还是担心我们下一步该怎么走
Or are ya worried about what we should do next?

314
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,017
如果我在那岸边的话我会更担心
I'd be a lot more worried if I was sittin' on that beach.

315
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,021
剩下的那些人  他们在谈论什么
And the rest of the group-- what are they saying?

316
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:56,019
我想他们在谈论...(羊叫声)
I think they're saying, "baa."

317
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,085
关于绵羊的  这是件好事
That's the nice thing about sheep.

318
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:01,051
他们是这样预言的
They're predictable.

319
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,073
但是我不敢肯定Kate也这样想
But I ain't so sure about kate.

320
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,074
什么意思
What do you mean?

我要你发誓你不会伤害她
I need your word you ain't gonna do nothin' to her.

你知道吗  算了
You know what? forget it.

324
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,016
不  好吧
No, no. no. all right.

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,058
我向你保证
You have my word.

326

她和那家伙谈过了...
She talked to that guy...

331
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,081
就是从货船来的李小龙  你关着的那个
Bruce lee from the freighter- the guy you got locked up.

332
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,009
-他叫她把Ben带去和他谈谈  -不  不可能
He told her to bring ben down to him for a chat. no, that's impossible.

333
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,060
-她连Miles在哪都不知道  -什么
She doesn't even know where miles is. what?

334
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,047
他在去船坞的船库里
the boathouse down by the dock?

335
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,039
只要Hugo知道  大家都会知道
If hugo knows, everybody knows.

336
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,010
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

是的  我确定

你带那玩意儿要上哪去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. where you going with that?

339
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,062
不管Miles要对Ben说什么
Whatever miles has to say to ben,

340
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:13,006
他都可以和我说
He can say to me.

346

你安排这次会面就是为了敲诈我吗?
You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?

358
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,099
如果你认为是敲诈  那就是吧
It's extortion, if you wanna get technical.

359
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:11,036
320万  为什么不说330万或340万
3.2? well, why not 3.3 or 3.4?

360
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,039
是什么让你觉得我有那么多钱

不要以为我是他们中一员
Do not treat me like I'm one of them,

362
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,069
不要认为我不知道你是谁和你的能力

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,081
如果我是你  我就会呆在这岛上
If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island.

384
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,051
这样谁也不知道  别人可能以为你在坠毁中死了
Who knows? maybe you didn't survive the crash.

385
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,088
走吧
Come on.

我们是要花点时间去习惯睡这床

391
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,046
我没吵醒Aaron吧?

没有  Aaron是在这岛上出生的

Kate  我只想知道他们说了什么

Miles告诉Ben

他会向他船上的老板撒谎

我想你们俩该单独谈谈

409
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,072
我不想和她谈
i don't need any privacy.

410
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,081

他说你是个英雄
Dr. shephard-- that you're a hero.

415

你为什么不理我?

我冒险去看你

418
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,090
-你却大叫救命还打电话给警察  -求你了

429
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:18,093

I don't want to testify against you.

430

那就不要
Then don't.

431
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:37,053
我想见见我孙子
I want to see my grandson.

你来这和我谈条件?
You came here to make a deal?

对不起  我不能坐视不管

我想让他觉得你也耍了我 
I wanted him to think that you fooled me, too.

441
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,039
他相信我们俩
No sense in him not trusting both of us.

442
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,071
他让我在明天前离开
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

443
