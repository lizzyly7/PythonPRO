你在粉刷天花板时
Well, what's happening is the result of combining ladders,

178
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:05,005
你从梯子上摔下来了
painting the ceiling and alcohol.

179
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:09,053

- 这是我的公寓 - 对啊
This is my flat.

181

如果你想要我有家的感觉的话
Although if you want me to feel at home here,

182
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:18,029
你最好叫它我们的公寓
you might start calling it our flat.

183
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:22,050
几个手指 Des?
How many fingers, Des?

脑震荡好了吗?
How's that concussion?

好了
All right

197
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,074
你不需要为我爸打工的 Des
You know you don't really need a job from my father, Des.

198
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,075
那和工作无关
It's not about the job.

199
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,091
我想让他尊重我
I want him to respect me.

200
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,041
他会尊重你的
Then respect you he shall.

201
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,044
但如果是他太愚蠢而忽略了你的才华
But if for some reason he's too daft to see how brilliant you are,

202
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:01,022
那也不是世界末日
it's not the end of the world.

203

00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:45,036
Penny的父亲训斥你不会有出息
Penny's father berates you for not being a great man,

312
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:49,009
你就预见未来你去按那个 拯救世界的按钮?
and viol? You’ve dreamed a future where you push a button to save the world.

313
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,049
那些都是真的 兄弟
These things are not in my head,brother.

314
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,078
我记起来了
I remember things.

315
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:58,003
好吧
All right, then.

316
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,099
那接下来会发生什么?
What happens next?

317
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,024
不是这样的
It doesn't work like that.

318
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,058
我记不得所有事 只是...
I don't remember everything, just...

319
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,062
零星的片段
just bits and pieces.

320
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:11,077
那还真巧
How wonderfully convenient.

321
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:23,012
我记得这个
I remember this.

322
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:26,030
我知道这首歌
I know this song.

323
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,068
那个点唱机...
The jukebox...

324
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:33,051
Des 我开始担心你了
Des, you're worrying me now.

325
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,091
我记得这个夜晚
I remember this night.

326
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,072
gray bridge在两球落后比赛只剩2分钟的情况下
Graybridge comes back from two goals down in the final two minutes

327
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,080
最后反败为胜
to win this game.

328
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,010
真是个奇迹!
It's a bloody miracle!

329
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,049
然后 Jimmy Lennon 从那扇门走进来
Jimmy Lennon's goanna come through that door

330
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:47,055
用板球棍打伤了酒保的头
and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat,

331
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,029
因为他欠了他钱
'cause he owes him money.

332
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,048
- 说实在的 Des--
- Seriously, Des-

333
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,010
看好了
Just watch.

334
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,011
现在他要进球了
He'll score the first goal right now.

335
00:22:57,064 --> 00:23:00,074
哦!完美的扑救...
Brilliant save by...

336
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:03,014
不不--他们卷土重来
They came back.

337
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,080
他们--他们赢了
They--they won.

338
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,057
Jimmy lennon和板球棍
Jimmy Lennon, cricket bat.

339
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:21,045
根本没什么时间旅行 Des
There's no such thing as time travel, Des.

340
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:30,076
据我所知 真爱难求
And from what I understand, true love can be just as unlikely.

341
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:38,068
如果你真的爱 Penny  就马上和她结婚
So, if you love Penny, stop messing about and marry her.

342
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:17,036
你闻起来像去过酒吧
You smell like the pub.

343
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:21,084
那是因为我刚从那里回来
That's because I was at the pub.

344
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:23,048
你没有得到工作?
You didn't get the job.

345
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:25,097
是的
yes

346
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:28,077
我父亲对你说了什么?
What did my father say?

347
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:33,040
你父亲...很可爱
Your father... was lovely.

348
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,050
对于我没有资格的问题上 我们达成了共识
We just both agreed that I wasn't exactly qualified.

349
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,008
我说我们来庆祝
I say we celebrate.

350
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,036
庆祝命运褪去了你痛苦的存在
I say we celebrate that fate has spared you a miserable existence

351
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:47,014
于 widmore 公司里
under the employ of Widmore industries.

352
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:48,025
明天让我带你出去吧
Let me take you out tomorrow.

353
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,055
我们去长提的龙虾馆 我请客
Let's go for lobsters on the pier, my treat.

354
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:54,088
我们不应该庆祝 因为你父亲不喜欢我 
I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate.

355
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:59,005
但是我爱你
Well, the occasion is I love you.

356
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:04,072
为什么?
Why?

357
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:07,078
你为什么爱我?
Why do you love me?

358
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:11,008
因为你是个好人
'Cause you're a good man.

359
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:15,085
这就是我爱你的原因
In my experience, they’re pretty hard to come by.

360
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:28,084
嘿 Des?
Hei, Des?

361
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:32,061
你在哪?
Where are you?

362
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:36,079
我就在你身边
I'm right here.

363
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:51,003
第一次做这事吧?
Never done this before, have you?

364
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:53,038
那还不明显吗?
Is it that obvious?

365
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,013
我一向能看出来的
I can always tell the first-timers.

366
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:02,001
你能告诉我你的心理价位吗?
Now then, may I ask your price range?

367
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,028
我不是那种吝啬的人
I'm not a man of means.

368
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,033
我希望 有一天...
I hope to, you know, one day...

369
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:10,063
我正好有你想要的东西
I have just the thing.

370
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,087
这不会弄瞎女王的双眼
This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still,

371
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:27,087
但那仍是生命之光
it has the sparkle of life.

372
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:36,055
我就要这个了
I'll take it.

373
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:37,080
我...抱歉?
I'm... sorry?

374
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,099
这个很完美 我买下了
It's perfect. I'll take it.

375
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,029
不 你不会的
No, you won't.

376
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,093
把戒指还给我
Give me the ring. Give it here.

377
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:49,095
我不明白
I don't understand.

378
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:50,071
这是不对的
This is wrong.

379
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,072
你没买下这枚钻戒
You don't buy the ring.

380
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:53,044
你犹豫了
You--you have second thoughts.

381
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,026
你从那扇门走出去了
You walk right out that door.

382
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:58,067
所以还是还给我吧
So come on. Let's have it.

383
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,012
我不知道你是怎么了
I don't know what you're on about.

384
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:05,084
你没买这枚戒指 Desmond
You don't buy the ring, Desmond.

385
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:09,034
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

386
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:13,016
我不仅知道你的名字 还知道你没有向Penny求婚
I know your name as well as I know that you don't ask Penny to marry you.

387
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:15,008
事实上 你伤了她的心
In fact, you break her heart.

388
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,052
当然...
Well, breaking her heart, of course,

389
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,053
这驱使你几年后
is what drives you in a few short years from now

390
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:22,064
参加那个航海来证明她父亲是错的
to enter that sailing race to prove her father wrong,

391
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:25,084
然后来到了那个岛上
which brings you to the island

392
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:29,017
花了三年来输入那些数字
where you spend the next three years

393
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:35,009
直到你被迫转动了那个应急钥匙
of your life entering numbers into the computer, until
 you are forced to turn that fail-safe key.

394
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,035
如果你没做那些事的话 Desmond David Hume
And if you don't do those things,Desmond David Hume,

395
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:45,042
我们都会死的
every single one of us is dead.

396
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:51,063
所以还是把戒指还给我
So give me that sodding ring.

397
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:02,077
我知道这对你很难
You're going to be difficult about this, I can see.

398
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:05,068
你是谁?
Who are you?

399
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:09,064
你喜欢栗子吗?
Do you like chestnuts?

400
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,021
什么?
What?

401
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:15,098
谢谢
Thank you.

402
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:25,033
那个男人穿了双红色的鞋子
That man over there is wearing red shoes.

403
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,036
那又怎么样?
So? What, then?

404
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:34,081
只是想说他不怎么赶时髦
Just thought it was a bold fashion choice worth noting.

405
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:40,090
这些都不真的 是吗?
This isn't really happening, is it?

406
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,062
什么?
Sorry?

407
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:49,023
我有过脑震荡
I've had a concussion.

408
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:52,071
你是我的潜意识
You're my subconscious.

409
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:54,084
是吗?
Am I?

410
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,061
你来这是...
You're here to...

411
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:59,096
让我别向Penny求婚
to talk me out of marrying Penny.

412
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:02,054
那不会管用的
Well, it won't bloody work.

413
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:04,016
不 你错了
Oh, yes, it will.

414
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,050
不
No

415
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,027
那里没什么岛
There is no island.

416
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,085
没什么按钮
There is no button.

417
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,061
那太疯狂了
It's madness.

418
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,087
我爱她 她也爱我
I love her. She loves me.

419
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:16,002
我想和她度过余生
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with her.

420
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,098
不 Desmond...
No, Desmond...

421
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:21,047
你不会的
You won’t.

422
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:29,097
哦 我的天
Oh,My God

423
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:36,047
你知道这会发生的 是吗?
You knew that was gonna happen, didn’t you?

424
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,083
为什么什么也不做?
Why didn't you do anything?

425
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:44,083
因为我不能改变一切
Because it wouldn't matter.

426
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:51,024
我告诉他那个脚手架 明天他还是会被出租车撞死
Had I warned him about the scaffolding, tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi.

427
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:57,003
如果我警告他那个出租车 后天他在洗澡时滑倒摔断了脖子
If I warned him about the taxi, he'd fall in the shower and break his neck.

428
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,061
这个宇宙 很不幸 有某种...
The universe, unfortunately,has a way of...

429
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:04,067
流动的联系
course-correcting.

430
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:07,054
那个男人注定要死的
That man was supposed to die.

431
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:11,045
这是他的路
That was his path.

432
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,021
你的路就是在那座岛上
Just as it's your path to go to the island.

433
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:22,018
你这样做是没有选择的 Desmond
You don't do it because you choose to, Desmond,

434
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:27,033
你原本就应该这样做
you do it because you're supposed to.

435
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:32,073
一小时后我要和 Penny 见面
I'm gonna meet Penny in an hour.

436
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,014
我要向她求婚
I've got the ring.

437
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:37,039
她会答应的
She'll say yes.

438
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,059
我可以选择我的路
I can choose whatever I want.

439
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:46,006
你不一定喜欢你的那条路 Desmond
You may not like your path, Desmond,

440
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:55,013
但按那个按钮才是真理
but pushing that button is the only truly great thing that you will ever do.

441
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:07,001
我要付你多少钱?
How much for the ring?

442
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,085
- 嗨! - 嘿
-hai

443
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:59,075
- 我迟到了吗? - 你来的正好
- Am I late?- Right on time.

444
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,057
可爱的恋人 拍张照吧?
Take your photo, lovebirds?

445
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:02,074
不 谢谢了 朋友
No, thanks, mate.

446
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:05,036
你们总要那些给孙子看的
Come on, something to show the grandkids.

447
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,035
来吧 Des 拍给我们的孙子看
Come on, Des, let's do it for all those grandkids.

448
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,036
是吗? 要拍吗?
You'll do it?

449
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:09,084
好吧
All right.

450
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,051
让我看看什么适合你们?
Let's see what we got for you here, eh?

451
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:14,062
- 啊 美丽的沙漠 - 不
Ah, a beautiful desert scene.

452
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,046
不是沙漠? 好吧
No, not the desert? All right.

453
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,010
啊 我知道了 森林吧
I know. The Alps.

454
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,061
啊 我喜欢这森林
I love the Alps.

455
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:20,067
哦 我讨厌这个
I hate the Alps.

456
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:23,003
是啊 也不是森林
Yeah, not the alps.

457
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:25,085
这张行了吧 迷人的marina景色
Here we go. Beautiful marina scene.

458
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:29,032
- 我们拍这幅吧 - 就是这幅没错吧?
- Yeah, let's do that.- It's the one, isn't it?

459
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,046
好了
All right.

460
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,053
- 把上衣脱掉 - 你们站好位置了!
Take your coat off. It’s boiling.

461
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:34,033
这样不错 还有棕树
There's palm trees.

462
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,017
好 准备
Here we go.

463
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,059
1,2...
one,two…

464
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,046
哦 真是经典

不要把这个说成 我做了什么 我应该怎样...
then don't make this about what I do or don't deserve...

而体面的承认你这样做 因为你是个懦夫!
