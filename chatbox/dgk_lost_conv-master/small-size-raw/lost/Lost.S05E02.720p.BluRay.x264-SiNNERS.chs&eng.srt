伙计  他们会发现的
Dude, they'll find out.

11
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:29,000
口风紧点就行
Not if we stick to the story.

12
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,043
我不知道  Jack  这么做可能有危险
I don't know, jack. it could be a risk.

13
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:34,057
这是唯一的办法  我们必须得这么做
It's the only way. We have to do this.

14
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,017
他们还没决定是吗
they're still at it, huh?

15
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,053
我们没有时间了
Look, we're running out of time.

16
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:40,070
现在就得做决定
We gotta make a decision now.

17
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,060
大家都同意这样做吗
So are we all okay with this?

18
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:47,007
这个决定会影响我们的余生
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,060
我不会草率地决定
I'm not taking it lightly.

20
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:51,077
Kate
Kate?

21
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:53,073

但是我们得知道你和我们是一致的
But we need to know that you're with us.

26
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:08,033
不管你们怎么决定  我都同意
Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.

27
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,080
Hurley  你怎么想
Hurley, what about you?

28
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:14,067
我们不该撒谎  伙计
I don't think we should lie, dude.

29
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:18,063
Hurley  我们得保护留下的那些人
We need to protect the people that we left behind, hurley.

30
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:20,014
撒谎怎么能保护他们
How does lying protect them?

31
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,000
可以保护他们不受Charles Widmore的伤害
It protects them from charles widmore.

32
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,037
那家伙雇了一批人要杀了我们
The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us.

33
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:25,075
他伪造了飞机失事
He faked a plane crash.

34
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:27,087
你认为告诉他实话以后
I mean, you think telling him the truth,

35
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,087
他还能放过他们
He's just gonna-- he's gonna leave them alone?

36
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:33,043
他是你老爸  是吗
Look, he's your dad, right?

37
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:35,067
你不能让他罢手吗
Can't you, like... call him off?

38
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:38,033
没有什么能阻止我父亲
There's no calling my father off.

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,044
但是他永远都不会找到他们
But he'll never find them.

40
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,093
那小岛消失了
I mean, the island disappeared.

41
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:43,003
我们都看到了
We all saw it. it's gone.

42
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,097
"噗"的一下
Bloop!

43
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:47,080
你认为有人会相信...
You think anyone's gonna believe that...

44
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,087
这无稽之谈吗
Believe any of it?

45
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:52,083
他们会认为你疯了
They're gonna think you're crazy.

46
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:56,004
如果有人给我作证就不会
Not if someone backs me up.

47
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,057
Sayid  来吧
Sayid, come on.

48
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:01,083
如果我说实话  他们会认为我是个白痴
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth.

49
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:04,067
但是如果我们都说实话会怎样呢
But what if we all do?

50
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,097
如果我们能为彼此作证
And if we can stick together,

51
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,093
就会让他们相信我们
we can make 'em believe us.

52
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,046
我不想下半辈子活在谎言里
I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying.

53
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,077
-你想吗  -不想
- do you? - no.

54
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,013
但是
But...

55
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:16,024
我们没有更好的选择
I don't believe we have a better choice.

56
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:23,001
我很抱歉  Hurley  但是我们必须得撒谎
I'm sorry, hurley, but we have to lie.

57
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,073
你知道吗  伙计
You know what, dude?

58
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:30,093
我会记住你的所作所为
I'm gonna remember this.

59
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:33,037
有一天  你会需要我帮忙
And someday, you're gonna need my help,

60
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:36,047
我现在就告诉你
And I'm telling you right now...

61
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,098
我不会帮你
You're not gettin' it.

62
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:52,090
醒醒  Sayid
Wake up, sayid!

63
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,087
Sayid

Sayid  醒醒

00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:58,084
Sayid

00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:26,061
我应该怎么做
What am I supposed to do?!

68
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:40,013
好了  好了  好了
Okay, okay, okay.

69
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,021
保持冷静
Just stay calm.

70
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:50,048
你到底想什么呢
What the hell were you thinking?

71
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,093
-Ana Lucia  -你像个疯子一样开车
- Ana lucia? - you were driving like a maniac.

72
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:57,050
还有  你为什么靠边停车
And why'd you pull over?

73
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:59,087
我只是  我  我想
I just... i-i thought--

74
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:03,010
如果我是真的你该怎么办
You didn't think. what if I were real?

75
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,067
如果真的有警察拦住你怎么办
What if a real cop stopped you?

76
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:08,017
他们有你浑身染血
They already have pictures of you covered in blood

77
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:11,010
-手里还拿着枪  -实际上  那些是番茄酱
- With a gun in your hand. - actually, it's ketchup.

78
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:14,010
我们去了快餐店...然后...
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh....

79
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:17,007
你得振作起来
Well, you need to pull it together.

80
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,020
-你有许多事情要做  -是吗
- You've got a lot of work to do. - I do?

81
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:24,000
从最基本的开始  首先  你需要新衣服
Let's start with the basics. first off, you need new clothes.

82
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,037
然后你得去个安全的地方
Then you need to go to a safe place.

83
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:28,097
把Sayid带到某个你信任的人那里去
And take sayid to somebody you trust.

84
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,073

00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,073
那就开始干吧
Then get to it.

00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:36,014
还要远离警察
And stay away from the cops.

87
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:40,098
别被抓到
Do not get arrested.

88
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,048
谢谢  Ana Lucia
Thanks, ana lucia.

89
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:49,091

00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:13,003
听她的
You heard her.

91
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:37,036
你真的认为那东西有用
You really think that thing's gonna work?

92
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,074
Rose  我告诉你上百次了
Rose, I told you a hundred times.

93
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,098
当然会有用  是的  我努力这么做
Of course it's gonna work. yes. I worked hard on it.

94
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,046
这比把两根棍子放在一起磨擦有效
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.

95
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,051
就该这么做,
That's what you supposed to do

96
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,097
是吗  我认为这个更有效  好吗
Yeah? well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?

97
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:48,040
我认为你在里面木头放太多了
Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside.

98
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,036
这会把叶子盖住
That's gonna smother the leaves.

99
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:51,038
Rose  如果没有足够的木头,叶子不会着起来的
Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.

100
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,017
生火  谁在乎生火啊
Fire? who cares about fire?

101
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:57,023
天空随时随刻都会发光
Any minute the sky could light up,

102
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,060
谁他妈的知道这次会发生什么
And who the hell knows what could happen this time?

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,059
Neil  我们正全力做我们能控制的事情
Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,009
你要么帮忙要么闭嘴
You are either gonna help or be quiet!

105
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,046
-这是谁的衬衫  -是我的
- Whose shirt is this? - it's mine.

106
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,081
能给我吗
Can I have it?

107
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:10,099
这有什么要紧  我们日落的时候就会死去
what does it matter? we're all gonna be dead by sundown.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,049
我认为这表示你同意  哈蚂脸
I'll take that as a "yes," frogurt.

109
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,057
-我叫Neil  -是啊  是啊
- It's neil. - yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,062
这个仍然完好吗
Still in one piece?

111
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,006
据我所知是的  
As far as I can tell.

112
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:26,050
我认为船和其他成员一起消失了
I figured it would've disappeared With the rest of our stuff.

113
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,029
我认为航行中我们所携带的东西
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved

114
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,049
都一起消失了
Is along for the ride.

115
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,006
怎么啦
What?

116
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,050
看谁回来了
Look who's back.

117
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:47,059
欢迎回来  魔法教授
Welcome back, dr. wizard.

118
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,099
-我说他是魔法先生  -闭嘴
I think it's mr. wizard. shut up.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,019
你离开了2个小时  你到底在干什么
You've been gone for two hours. what the hell were you doing?

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,042
是啊  完全正确  我很抱歉
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

121
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,039
我的包落在丛林里了  我回来了
I...  left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,046
并且  我  我  只是  过了一段时间
And i-i-i just--it was a while before I realized

123
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,059
我才意识到我  我迷路了
That I was just... uh, I was really lost.

124
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,062
你算出来天空何时再次发光了吗
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?

125
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:07,049
我不知道  好吧  你至少有个计划吧
I don't know. well, you at least got a plan?

126
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,049
我认为我们应该拿着罗盘
I think we should take the zodiac,

127
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,099
-前往某条航运航线  -不行  不行
- Head to a shipping lane. - no. no, no, no.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,052
任何情况下我们都不能出航
We can't just sail out on any course.

129
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,099
如果要离开  我得重新测算方位
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing,

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,077
而且  为了定位
And, uh, to do that...

131
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:23,017
我需要确定我们的位置...
I need to determine where we are now...

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,056
在时间里
Time.

133
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:29,089
那剩下的人应该做什么呢
And what are the rest of us supposed to do?

134
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,072
我去给我们找点吃的
I'm gonna go find us something to eat.

135
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:33,079
你计划怎么做呢
And how are you planning on doing that?

136
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,080
别担心
Don't worry about it.

137
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,002
我们找水去
I guess we'll get the water.

138
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,082
伙计  醒醒啊
Dude, wake up!

139
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,023
醒醒  我一个人做不了这些

我喜欢这只西施犬
I like shih tzus.

144

看起来你把他们爱到心窝里去了
It looks like you "heart" them.

145
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,086
不愉快的夜晚
Rough night?

146
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,012
嗯
Yeah.

147
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,036
你朋友很颓废

嗯
Yeah.

149

00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,089
-你看起来很眼熟  -只是大众脸罢了
Yeah, you definitely look familiar. I just have one of those faces.

152
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,097
你在撒谎
You're lying.

153
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,092

00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:15,055
你说"发现"是什么意思
What do you mean you "found" it?

302
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:19,022
它死在树林里  我发现了它
It died in the jungle. I found it.

303
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:23,028
别担心  没事的  刚死了三个小时
Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.

304
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:25,030
什么
What?

305
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:26,033
谁有刀
Who's got a knife?

306
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,050
刀  你要刀吗
A knife? You need a knife?

307
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,028
就在烤箱旁边
Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.

308
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,038
你在说什么
What's your problem?

309
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,023
我是说  我们根本就没有刀
My problem is, we don't have a knife.

310
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,036
我们什么都没有
W-we don't have anything.

311
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:38,013
即使我们有了也无济于事
And it wouldn't even matter if we did,

312
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:40,028
因为那个牙医Bernie连火都没生起来
'Cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.

313
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,028
放松点  哈蚂脸
Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.

314
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,043
我叫Neil  你个傻瓜
It's Neil, you inbred.

315
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,029
我可放松不了
And I'm not gonna ease up,

316
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,088
因为我又累又饿  糟透了
'Cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed!

317
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,076
-我们都糟透了  -冷静点  Neil
- We're all screwed! - Calm down, Neil.

318
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,073
我们会挺过去的
We're gonna get through this.

319
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,016
我们怎么可能挺过去
How are any of us gonna get through this?!

320
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,060
你没听到我说的吗  我们连火都生不起来
Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!

321
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,077
快跑
Run!

322
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:39,064
快点  分开  大家都到小溪那里去
Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!

323
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:44,093
Dan
Ow! Dan!

324
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,011
快跑
Keep moving!

325
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,061
快走  他死了
Come on. He's dead.

326
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:10,029
快点  你也想送死吗  快点
Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!

327
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,012
你做不了什么  我们得赶快跑
There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!

328
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,038
他们在监视我们吗
Dude, they're on a stakeout?

329
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,014
你刚从精神病院中逃出来
You just escaped from a mental institution.

330
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,072
还死了人
There's dead bodies everywhere!

331
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,034
他们当然要监视我们
Of course they're on a stakeout!

332
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:31,024
他们认为你疯到要回家来
They think you're crazy enough to come back home.

333
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,005
你是不是...
S-so are you...

334
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,072
疯了
Crazy?

335
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,022
你觉得我是吗
Do you think I am?

336
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,052
否则你就是在骗我
Well, either that or you're lying to me.

337
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,057
我没疯
I'm not crazy,

338
00:22:56,058 --> 00:23:01,016
而且我欺骗你是有原因的
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.

339
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,039
什么原因
Well, what is it?

340
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:11,069
我沙发上怎么会有个巴基斯坦死人
Why is there a dead pakistani on my couch?!

341
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,032
他没死  妈妈
He's not dead, ma.

342
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,008
但他没气了
Well, he's not breathing.

343
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,043
没气了吗
He's not?!

344
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,078
没关系  Carmen  我们有个计划
It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.

345
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,072
计划  你们在说什么
A plan? What are you talking about?

346
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:28,025
他还有气...算有吧  爸  我们要走了
He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.

347
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,053
Hugo  发生了什么
Hugo, what's happening?

348
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:30,028
妈  拜托
Mom, please!

349
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:34,025
别跟我说"妈  拜托"  新闻里怎么都是你
No "mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news?

350
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,071
你知道他们怎么说你吗
Do you know what they are telling about you?

351
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:37,022
我知道  妈
Yeah, mom. I know.

352
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,083
一切都会真相大白的  我保证
Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.

353
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,076
但愿如此
It better!

354
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,069
长官

356
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:05,098
几天而已
Just a few days.

357
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,022
我来谈点公事
I have some business to attend to.

358
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,065
但是我一直很想见你
But I wanted to see you.

359
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,039
这呢
Here it is.

360
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,073
她叫Ji Yeon  这是她的照片
Her name's ji yeon. here's a baby picture.

361
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:20,007
她真漂亮
Oh! she's beautiful.

362
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:23,063
谢谢  她在首尔的外婆家
Thank you. she's with her grandmother in seoul.

363
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:26,007
希望有朝一日你们能够见面
I hope someday you get to meet her.

364
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,053
她和Aaron在一起玩一定很可爱
It would be nice to see her and aaron play together.

365
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:32,018
是啊
Yeah.

366
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:35,067
Kate  你还好吧
Kate? are you all right?

367
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:39,020
我很好
Yeah. I'm fine.

368
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,044
真的么
Are you?

369
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:55,013
有人知道我们在撒谎
Somebody knows we're lying.

370
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,050
什么
What?

371
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:58,047
几个律师去找过我
Some lawyers came to see me.

372
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:59,050
谁
Who?

373
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:01,080
两个男人  他们来过我家
Two men. they came to my house

374
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:04,033
要求我们验血
And they asked for a blood sample.

375
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,070
好像要起诉我们
Some kind of lawsuit.

376
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,040
他们想要检测
They wanted to test to see if...

377
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,043
Aaron是不是我的孩子
To see if aaron's my son.

378
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,010
哪里派来的律师
Who did these lawyers represent?

379
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:18,088
不知道  他们不告诉我他们的委托人是谁
I don't know. they wouldn't tell me who their client is.

380
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:23,043
那么说他们并不想将这个谎言公开
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.

381
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:25,060
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

382
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:28,010
因为他们想的话  早就下手了
Because if they were, they would just do it.

383
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,020
他们不会私下找你
They wouldn't come to you in private.

384
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:33,013
他们并不关心我们是不是撒了谎  他们想要的是Aaron
They don't care that we're lying. they just want aaron.

385
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:36,073
但是  谁会想要这么做
But who... who would do that? we--

386
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:39,080
我不知道  但是你要解决他们
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.

387
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,033
什么叫解决他们
What do you mean, take care of them?

388
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:45,020
为了保护Aaron
Wouldn't you do anything you had to

389
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,048
你会在所不惜吧
In order to keep aaron?

390
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,078
你以为我是什么人
What kind of a person do you think I am?

391
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:02,060
Jin  jin
Jin! jin!

392
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:07,003
那种在危机关头会痛下决断的人
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.

393
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:09,070
你带着孩子上飞机  我去找Jin
You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get jin.

394
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:13,041
就像你在货船上做的那样
Like you did on the freighter.

395
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,023
你让我上飞机
You told me to get on the helicopter,

396
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:22,070
-你说你会找到Jin  -我们得赶快离开这里
- And you said you'd get jin. - We gotta get outta here!

397
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:25,087
Sun  我希望你不要误会
Sun, I hope you don't think...

398
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:28,050
你做了不得不做的事
But you did what you had to do.

399
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:32,078
如果你没有这么做
And if you hadn't...

400
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,051
我们可能全都死了  而不光是我的丈夫
We probably all would've died instead of just my husband.

401
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,093
对不起
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:50,067
真的对不起
I'm so sorry. i...

403
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,074
我没有怪你
I don't blame you.

404
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:02,097
说起来
So...

405
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:05,064
Jack现在怎么样
How's jack?

406
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,083
Hugo说我可以信任你
Hugo said I could trust you.

407
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:14,043
我不这么肯定  但是他发了誓  那么
I wasn't so sure. but he swore I could, so...

408
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,027
我可以信任你吗
Can i?

409
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:18,003
当然可以
Yes. of course.

410
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,031
好吧
All right.

411
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,093
他出什么事了
What happened to him?

412
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:30,037
Hugo说他给飞镖砸了
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.

413
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:32,053
肯定是嗑了药什么的
Must've been some drugs or something.

414
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:36,003
-Hurley现在在哪  -在家里  快崩溃了
- And where is hurley right now? - At our house, freaking out.

415
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:38,017
我去取我的车  帮我把他抬过来
Let me get my car. help me move h over.

416
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,029
送他上医院
I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.

417
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,015
不行  Hugo说不管谁送他去医院
No. no, h-hugo said that whoever did this--

418
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:43,096
都会引火上身  为了你好  先生
They'll come back after him. all due respect, mr.

419
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,031
Reyes  是你带他找的我
Reyes, but you brought him to me,

420
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:48,002
-所以我会全部为Sayid着想  -那好吧
-So I'm gonna do what I think is best for sayid. -all right, fine.

421
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,021
带他去医院
Take him to the hospital.

422
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:51,061
Shephard大夫  你看我什么都听你的
But with all due respect to you, dr. shephard,

423
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:54,011
-等办完事  你要帮我个忙  -什么忙
-When this is over, you're gonna do something for me. -what?

424
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:57,055
离Hugo远点  不管你是怎么取信于Hugo的
Stay away from hugo. whatever it is you talked him into,

425
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,021
我有预感
Something tells me

426
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,071
你不会全心为他着想的
You don't have his best interests at heart.

427
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:05,082
所以你离我儿子远点
So stay away from my son.

428
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:16,098
你好
Hello?

429
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,028
Ben
Ben...

430
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,021
你肯定猜不出谁不请自来了
You'll never guess who just showed up my door

431
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:22,041
谁
Who?

432
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:25,096
Sayid
Sayid.

433
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,098
谁是Sayid
Who is sayid?

434
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:44,061
我以为他是你朋友
I thought he was your friend.

435
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:46,028
他是我朋友
He is my friend...

436
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,024
但他同时具有双重人生
But he's also got this double life

437
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,054
他那套忍者行动和间谍什么的
Where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.

438
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:52,054
但是他是好人
But he's a good guy.

439
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:54,091
好人不会杀死三个人
A good guy doesn't kill three men.

440
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:57,074
好人不会杀任何人
A good guy doesn't kill any men.

442
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,091
Hugo  你麻烦大了
You are in terrible trouble, hugo.

443
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:05,041
新闻说是你杀的人
The news thinks you did this.

444
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:08,094
新闻这么说  人就会这么传
And if the news does, everyone does.

445
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:11,071
为什么会这样
Why is this happening?

446
00:29:11,072 --> 00:29:14,099
怎么会有人想要伤害你
How can anybody want to hurt you?

447
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,095
我不知道
I don't know.

448
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:31,025
实话告诉妈妈
Tell your mother the truth.

449
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:37,029
我们说了谎  妈妈
We lied, ma.

450
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:43,011
什么叫你们撒了谎
What do you mean you lied?

451
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:45,011
我们几个  大洋六人
All of us-- the oceanic six,

452
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:48,081
坠机后发生的事  我们说了谎
We lied about what happened after the crash.

453
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:51,055
那到底发生什么了
And what did happen?

454
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,041
好吧
Okay.

455
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,098
我们坠机了
See, we did crash,

456
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,038
坠毁到这个疯狂的岛屿
But it was on this crazy island.

457
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,092
我们就等救援  可是没有救援
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.

458
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:10,052
那有个黑烟怪物
And there was a smoke monster,

459
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:12,034
后来发现岛上还有其他人
And then there were other people on the island.

460
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,038
我们管他们叫The Others  他们开始攻击我们
We called them the others, and they started attacking us.

461
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,041
后来我们发现了一些舱门
And we found some hatches,

462
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:20,084
还有个按钮  你每隔108分钟就得按一下  否则
And there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...

463
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,081
其实我也不是太清楚
Well, I was never really clear on that.

464
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:27,079
但是The Others和那些舱没有关系
But... the others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.

465
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,031
那是达摩组织遗留下来的  但是他们都死了
That was the dharma initiative. but they were all dead.

466
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,034
The others杀死了他们  现在又来杀我们
The others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us.

467
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,081
后来我们和The others联手了
And then we teamed up with the others

468
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,068
因为有些坏人开着一艘货船来了
Because some worse people were coming on a freighter.

469
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,035
Desmond女朋友的老爸派的人来杀我们
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.

470
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,007
所以我们偷了他们的直升机
So we stole their helicopter

471
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,018
我们飞向他们的货船  可是船爆炸了
And we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up.

472
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:45,062
现在我们又回不去岛上
And we couldn't go back to the island

473
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:47,099
因为岛消失了  我们只能迫降在海上
Because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean,

474
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,018
我们在海上漂了一阵子有艘船过来把我们救了上去
And we floated there for a while Until a boat came and picked us up.

475
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:55,034
那时  就是我们六个  这部分是真的
And by then, there were six of us. that part was true.

476
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:05,034
但是
But the...

477
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:13,073
但是剩下的那些人
But the rest of the people...

478
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:16,004
他们也曾经和我们一起在飞机上
Who were on the plane?

479
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:21,048
可他们现在却还在那座岛上
They're still on that island.

480
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:38,004
我相信你
I believe you.

481
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,083
但是我不明白你的意思
I don't understand you,

482
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:47,011
但是我相信你
But I believe you.

483
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:55,021
很多人死了  妈妈
A lot of people died, ma.

484
00:31:57,028 --> 00:32:01,034
这样可怕的事情还在持续发生  因为
And now this bad stuff is happening because...

485
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:09,071
我们不该撒谎
We shouldn't have lied.

486
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:21,053
你没事吧
You okay?

487
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:24,050
我没事  我只是踩到了什么东西
Yeah, I'm fine. I just stepped on something.

488
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:26,068
什么东西卡住了
Something jammed...

489
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:34,000
妈的
Son of a bitch.

490
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:36,000
我们得继续往前走
We should keep moving.

491
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:38,047
我们得抓紧和其他人在小溪处汇合
We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.

492
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:39,092
那是条很长的小溪  James  是在它的哪个部分
It's a long creek, james. which part?

493
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,040
我不知道  可能是比较潮湿的那块
I don't know--the wet part.

494
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,068
如果我不用听他们的
Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan--

495
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:22,033
这些人是谁  是你的人吗
Who were those people? Are they yours?

496
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,093
是他们射的箭吗
Did they shoot the arrows?

497
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,057
你想我爬过去然后问问他们吗
You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?

498
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:28,001
没说让你耍小聪明  我只是
You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying--

499
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:42,031
你们在我们岛上做什么呢
What are you doing on our island?!

500
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,098
妈的
Son of a bitch.

501
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:38,057
给点反映  Sayid
Come on, sayid.

502
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:41,048

503

是我  我是Jack
It--it's... it's Jack.

505
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,080

00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:56,041
你没事了
U're okay. you're all right.

507
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:08,004
发生什么事情了
What happened?

508
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:12,057
你没事了  你现在在医院里
You're fine. you're in the hospital.

509
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:14,090
Hurley的爸爸带你来的
Hurley's father brought you to me.

510
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,098
怎么会是Hurley的爸爸
Hurley's father?

511
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:22,030
Sayid  之前你被攻击了
Sayid, you've been attacked.

512
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:24,024
Hurley在哪
Where's Hurley?

513
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:26,017
他和他双亲住在一起
He's at his parents' house.

514
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:27,074
谁跟他在一起呢
Who's with him?

515
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:30,037
我不知道  可能是他妈妈
I don't know. his mother, maybe?

516
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:33,078
还有谁知道他在那吗
Does anyone else know he's there?

517
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,078
你好  Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

518
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:52,024
离我远点
Get away from me.

519
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,057
快滚
Get away!

520
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:55,087
Hugo  我知道你现在遇到麻烦事了
Hugo, I know you're in trouble,

521
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:59,018
我可以向你保证  我会把所有事情解决
And I can assure you I've taken care of everything.

522
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:02,060
我有辆车  我们可以一起回去
I have a car waiting for us out back.

523
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:04,070
警察没看见我进来
The police didn't see me come in.

524
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:06,067
我可以带你离开这里
I can get you out of here.

525
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,077
不必了  老兄
No way, dude.

526
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,074
Sayid已经提醒过我关于你的事了
Sayid warned me about you.

527
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:13,017
我带你去见Sayid  他现在和Jack在一起
I'm taking you to sayid. he's with Jack.

528
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:16,021
所以我为什么会在这里  Hugo  是Jack叫我来的
That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me.

529
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:22,014
要不然我怎么知道他们是在一起的
How else would I know that they're together?

530
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,040
不
No.

531
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,087
你又想玩弄我
You're--you're playing one of your mind games.

532
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:28,060
他们永远不会相信你的
They would never trust you.

533
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:33,017
从他们的角度来说  我不是一个容易被信任的人
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.

534
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,077
但是他们却来找我了
But they came around

535
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:38,058
他们终于明白我们的目的是一致的
When they realized that we all want the same thing.

536
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,034
那是什么
And what's that?

537
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:46,031
回到岛上
To go back to the island.

538
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:52,044
跟我们一起走吧  Hugo
Come with us, Hugo...

539
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,004
这一切就会结束  你也不必再躲躲藏藏
And this'll be over. You can stop hiding.

00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,004
你不用再为我们的故事而担心
You can stop worrying about the stories

541
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:59,007
更不用担心欺骗别人
And the deceptions.

542
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,014
如果你跟我一起走的话
If you come with me,

543
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:06,038
就再也不用说谎了
You won't ever have to lie again.

544
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:15,068

545
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:21,071
让我来帮你吧
Let me help you.

546
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:35,011
想都别想  老兄
Never, dude.

547
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:40,054
你们抓到我了
Hey! hey, you got me!

548
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:44,000
对  你们抓到我了  我就是凶手  停  警察
That's right, you got me! that's right! I'm the killer! stop! police!

549
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,024
把身体转过去  然后朝我走过来  慢慢跪下
Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees! I'm the killer.

550
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:48,097
我是个杀人凶手  我杀了四个人  三个人
I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people.

551
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:54,065
都是我杀的   快把我带走吧
I killed them all. j-just-- just get me away from here.

552
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:04,091
快点带我走吧
Just get me out of here.

553
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:15,094
简洁明了...
I'm gonna make this quite simple for you.

554
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,094
快告诉我  你们在做什么
You're gonna tell me what you're doing,

555
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,042
你们有多少人  你们是怎么来这里的
How many of you there are and how you got here.

556
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:24,054
如果不是在回答问题  请闭嘴
Unless you're answering my questions, Don't speak.

557
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,002
快说  否则我砍下她的手
I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand. what?!

558
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,054
什么
What?!

559
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,094
-Other?  -你没有和我谈条件的资格
- Other?  - the first one isn't negotiable.

560
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:32,020
我只是在告诉你我不是在开玩笑
It's just to illustrate how serious I am.

561
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:34,080
不  等等  我们本不应该出现在这儿
No! hold on! hold on! chill out! we're not supposed to be here.

562
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,004
只是这个岛发生了什么事情
Something's happening to the island.

563
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,027
-那个闪光  -砍
- There are these flashes-  - do it!

564
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:41,094
不  等一下  我会告诉你你想知道的事情
No! wait a second! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!

565
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:43,081
-快  -不要
- Do it!  - No!

566
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,078
James  Juliet
James. Juliet.

567
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,088
看见你们真高兴
Nice to see ya.

568
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:46,010
运气好吗
Any luck?

569
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,060
是的
Yes.

570
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:49,084
真的吗
Really?

571
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,074
真的
Really.

572
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,060
你呢  你怎么样
What about you?

573
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,080
我遇到了一些困难
I'm having some... difficulties.

574
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:56,080
你最好抓紧时间
Well, you better get busy...

575
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,056
因为你只有七十个小时
Because you only have 70 hours.

576
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,093
不  给我的时间不够  我需要至少
No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least--

577
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:04,093
你需要什么已经不重要了
What you need is irrelevant.

578
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:08,040
你只有七十个小时
70 hours is what you've got.

579
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:12,037
听着  我今晚没能把Reyes带回来
Look, I lost reyes tonight.

580
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,024
如果我不能把他们带回来会怎样
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?

581
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,004
那就等着上帝来帮我们吧
Then god help us all.
