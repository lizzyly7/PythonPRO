翻过中央路障  滑到对面驶来的车流里

与一辆SUV迎面相撞了

给他这个减轻痛苦

我想现在这个情况  这种草药治疗不管用了
I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here.

138
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,093
这不是治疗
It is not a remedy.

139

150
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,022
这样不行  你在生孩子
It's not okay. You're having your baby.

151
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,068
不  我没有  好么?  只是胀气疼痛  没事
No, I'm not, okay? It's just gas pains. It's fine.

152
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,008
你开始宫缩了  Claire
You're having contractions, Claire.

153
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:06,013
不  该死的我没有  就让我一个人呆着好么?
No, I'm bloody not. Can you just leave me alone?

154
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,057
来吧  让我带你去Jack那儿  拜托站起来  拜托
Come on. I gotta get you to Jack. Please try to stand. Please.

155
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:09,073
听着  我不能!
Look, I can't!

00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,065

拜托救命  有人么
Please help! Somebody!

164
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,017
救命!
Help!

165
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:11,025
Jin  我要你去洞里把Jack带来  好么?  听懂了么?
Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay? You understand?

166
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,076
我们需要Jack
We need Jack.

167
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,037
Jack  医生
Jack. Doctor.

168
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:17,083
是的  是的  医生  来这儿
Yes. Yes, the doctor. Please come here.

169
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,031
别离开我
Don't leave me.

170
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,029
不不  亲爱的  我不会的
Oh, no, no, honey. I won't.

171
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,055
我哪儿也不去  好么?  我保证
I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise.

172
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,075
Jack  快一点
Jack. Hurry.

173
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:32,037
-再问问他  -他休克了
-Ask him again.  -He's in shock.

174
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:34,019
所以才要再问问他
That's why you need to ask him again.

175
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,032
Boone  能听见我说么?
Boone, can you hear me?

176
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:42,049
你的血型是什么?
What is your blood type?

177
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:48,070
Boone  拜托你听着
Boone, please listen.

178
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,057
你的血型是什么?
What is your blood type?

179
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:53,029
-该死  -也许小点更好
-Damn it.  -Maybe a smaller piece.

180
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,060
静脉就像湿面条
Veins are like a wet noodle.

181
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,039
首先你得找到一条静脉
First you have to find one,

182
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:00,030
然后要用一根够锋利的空心针刺穿它
then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it.

183
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,062
我却只有竹子
I've got bamboo.

184
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,085
什么都不重要了  因为我不知道他的血型
None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type.

185
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:12,004
-更不用说他的伤势...  -A型阴性的
-Not to mention that his injuries...  -A-negative.

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,000
Boone  你说什么?
Boone, what'd you say?

187
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:17,015
Shannon...

188
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,044
你听到"A型阴性"么?
Did you hear "a-negative"?

189
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:22,082
叫Charlie来  问一下你能找到的...
Get Charlie, ask everyone you can find...

190
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,036
所有人...他们的血型
everyone...what their blood type is.

191
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,049
A型阴性  好么?
A-negative, okay?

192
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,051
然后去找他的妹妹  去找Shannon
And find his sister. Find Shannon.

193
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,073
我们去哪儿?
Where are we going?

194
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,045
往这儿走
This way.

195
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,094
好的
Oh, okay.

196
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,062
你迷路了么?
Are you lost?

197
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,028
不  绝对没有
No. Absolutely not.

198
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:48,011
这些树看起来很眼熟
Those trees look really familiar.

199
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,055
我认为往这儿走
It's this way, I think.

200
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,071
你刚才说了"我认为"么?
Did you just say, "I think"?

201
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,076
给你个惊喜
Surprise.

202
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,046
混蛋
Damn it!

203
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,090
我找到了一个A型
I found an "A."

204
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:16,051
-阳性的还是阴性的?  -她不知道
-Positive or negative?  -She doesn't know.

205
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:20,041
我还找到了两个B型阳性的和一个AB型阴性的
I also found two B-positives and one AB-negative.

206
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,091
至少他认为是的
At least, he thinks so.

207
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,090
有O型阴性的么?
Did you find any O-negative?

208
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,063
-Sun说是A型阴性的  -她在哪儿?
-Sun said A-negative.  -Where is she?

209
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,053
我们分开了  我以为她会回这儿来
We split up. I thought she'd be back here.

210
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,017
那么你只问了4个人?
So you only asked four people?

211
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:33,079
我问遍了草地上所有的营地  没人知道自己的血型
I asked the whole sodding camp. No one knows their blood type.

212
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,030
我也不知道我那该死的血型
I don't know my bloody blood type.

213
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,057
你找到Shannon了么?
Did you find Shannon?

214
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:39,067
没有  我给你带来了这个
No, I was getting you this.

215
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,031
一根锋利得足够刺穿面条的空心针
A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle.

216
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,041
那很棒
It's perfect.

217
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,055
我不是想扫你的兴
Not to rain on your proverbial parade,

218
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,088
你是说需要一个A型阴性血的人?
but I thought you said we needed someone who was A-negative?

219
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,092
或是O型阴性的
Or o-negative.

220
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,097
那么  你要怎么做  没人是
Right, which judging by your tantrum, no one is.

221
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:08,068
你?  那你为什么让我们...
You? Why'd you make us...

222
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:10,011
O型阴性的血是万能的
O-neg is the universal donor.

223
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,076
大致上合适  但并不匹配
It's in the ballpark, it's not a match.

224
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,000
我的血可能使他变成过敏性休克...
My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock...

225
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,013
让他停止心跳
stop his heart.

226
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,053
你是说他会死?
You mean he'll die?

227
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,073
他不会死的
He's not gonna die.

228
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,030
那些女孩正在谈论你
Those girls are checking you out.

229
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,043
-你穿着你的PJ  -确实  是的
-You're in your PJs.  -Indeed, I am.

230
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,026
-她们可爱么?  -谁?
-Are they cute?  -Who?

231
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:57,022
在谈论我的那些女孩
The girls that are checking me out.

232
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:00,095
其中一个有点可爱
Mm, one of them's kinda cute,

233
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,012
另一个就不怎么样了
the other one's just trashy.

234
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,074
-弹"心与魂"?(Hoagie Carmichael作曲)  -好的
-"Heart and soul"?  -You got it.

235
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:10,046
-我来弹简单的部分  -当然
-I'm taking the easy part.  -Of course.

236
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:21,009
你知道  如果你不愿意  真的不必这么做
You know, you really don't have to do this if you don't want to.

237
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:24,080
你怎么知道我不愿意?
How do you know I haven't?

238
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,009
因为你不愿意
Because you haven't.

239
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,051
抱歉
Oops, sorry.

240
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:33,005
真是个愚蠢的主意
It was a silly idea.

241
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,084
我只是...看过了太多的新娘杂志
I just...I read too many bridal magazines.

242
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,030
我认为那固化了我的思维
I think it rotted my brain.

243
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,079
Sarah  我愿意  我会这么做
Sarah, I want to. I'm going to.

244
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,014
我只是在找合适的方法把它表达出来
I just have to figure out the right way to say it.

245
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,064
那只是誓言
They're just vows.

246
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,085
只是誓言?
Just vows?

247
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,003
他会来的
He's gonna come.

248
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,057
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

249
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,006
那么你在这儿该呆多久就呆多久
So, you stay down here as long as you need to.

250
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:12,034
等你准备好了  我会上楼来
And when you're ready, I'll be upstairs.

251
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:22,040
我等不及要嫁给你了  Jack Shepard
I cannot wait to marry you, Jack Shepard.

252
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,024
Jack

253
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:36,066
Jack

254
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,073
-Jack  医生  Jack. -Jack
-Jack. Doctor. Jack. -Jack.

255
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:04,013
Claire

256
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,003
Claire?  Claire怎么了?
Claire? What about Claire?

257
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:10,050
他说Claire和Kate在一起  她正在分娩
He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor.

258
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,061
Claire在生小孩?  在哪?  在哪?
Claire's having the baby? Where? Where?

259
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,057
他说他认为她还好  但是她很痛苦
He says he thinks she's okay, but she's in pain.

260
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,050
他知道宫缩有多快么?
Does he know how fast the contractions are coming?

261
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,015
每隔两分钟
Every two minutes.

262
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,017
她有呕吐么?
Is she nauseous?

263
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,052
她能站起来么?
Can she stand?

264
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,025
有出血么?  她的羊水破了么?
Is there any bleeding? Did her water break?

265
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,051
没  什么都没有
No, none of that.

266
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,053
但是她不能走
But she can't move.

267
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:36,065
我们得走了
We should go.

268
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,032
我们需要什么?  毛巾  绷带  热水
What do we need? Towels, bandages, hot water.

269
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,065
我们怎么带热水?
How do we take hot water?

270
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:41,087
你相信你能搞定的
I'm sure you'll figure all that out.

271
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:44,030
让Jin带上Charlie回Clair那儿去
You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire.

272
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:47,054
这些我能搞定  可是接生孩子那事  我怎么会做?
I can do that. That dilating thing, how do I look out for that?

273
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:50,032
听我说  告诉Kate...Charlie  看着我
Listen to me. Tell Kate...Charlie, look at me.

274
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,053
告诉Kate
Tell Kate

275
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,034
等到宫缩每60秒一次  听懂了么?
to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart. You got that?

276
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,005
然后她要让Claire开始推挤
Now, she's gonna need to make sure that Claire pushes,

277
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,052
别太用力  也别太快...
but not too hard, not too fast...

278
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,072
直到看到头后  再用最大的力气推
just until the head is clear, and then as hard as she can.

279
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:07,044
当小孩出来的时候  别让他的鼻子和嘴巴
When the baby is out, you make sure she clears its nose

280
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,070
被塞住了
and its mouth.

281
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,047
好的  但那时你会在那儿的  对吧?
Okay, but you'll be there by then, right?

282
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,055
不  我不会去任何地方
No, I won't. I'm not going anywhere.

283
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,087
我得呆在这儿
I need to stay here.

284
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:21,044
你告诉Kate  她得替这个孩子接生
Now you tell Kate she's gonna have to deliver this baby.

285
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,032
他们不会来了
They've stopped.

286
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,002
我认为他们快来了
That happens, I think.

287
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,068
不不  他们不会来了
No, no. They're not coming anymore.

288
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,081
我很好  我没事  我真的没事
I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay, really.

289
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:41,034
Claire...

290
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,040
不不不  我没事  真的
No, no, no. I'm okay, really.

291
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,098
Claire  我认为你不应该...
Claire, I don't think that you should be doing...

292
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,032
我想你的羊水破了
I think your water just broke.

293
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:52,057
不不不  我不能要这孩子!
No, no, no. I can't have the baby!

294
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:55,007
-冷静点  -我现在不能要孩子!
-Just hold on. -I can't have the baby now!

295
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:59,095
冷静点  Jack快来了  Claire  他快来了
Just hold on. Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming.

296
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,024
我把自己弄得很糟吧?
Screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?

297

John说...
John said...

别提有关舱门的事

314
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,073
Locke做了什么?  什么舱门?

我的腿好痛
My leg hurts.

316
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,033

我的哥哥...Boone...他其实不是我亲哥哥

我总是很在意他

没有

根本没有

332
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:33,071
我们和Boone得在这儿呆多久  上帝才知道
We're here for god knows how long, and so is Boone.

333
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,020

我只是...
I just...

不想进展太快
need to take it a little slow.

338

你觉得怎样?
Are you okay with that?

我不抱期待
I had no expectations.

346
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,056
-Jack在哪儿?  -他不能来

他不能来是什么意思?  他一定得来
What do you mean he couldn't come? He has to come.

348
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:28,010
他正在用自己的血给Boone输血
Yeah, he's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now.

349
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,065
好的  好的
Okay. Okay.

350
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:32,028
我们得把她抬起来带到Jack那儿
We'll just have to pick her up and bring her to him.

351
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,062
不  我们得把她带去Jack那儿  不然就来不及了
No, we have to get her to him before it's too late.

352
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,018
Jack说让你来接生
Jack said you have to deliver the baby.

353
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,098
他向我讲了整个经过  相当简单
Now he talked me through it, and it's relatively simple.

354
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:46,035
-Charlie  我做不来  -不  你能的  我有水...
-Charlie, I can't do this.  -Yes, you can. I have water...

355
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:48,086
你没在听我说  我不能接生的
You're not listening to me. I can't deliver this baby.

356
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:50,040
该死的总该有人做的
Well, somebody bloody has to.

357
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,095
你知道  我在那儿呆了一周多
You know, I was out there for over a week.

358
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,005
那几天我记不起来了
There are days I can't remember.

359
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,024
我是说  不知...
I mean, what if...

360
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:08,056
不知他们想对这孩子做什么?
what if they did something to the baby?

361
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:12,087
天哪  我还没准备好
God, I'm not ready for this.

362
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,002

00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,011
但是我们得一起来共度难关
But we're gonna get through this together.

367
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:46,020
醒醒  Boone
Come on, Boone.

368
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,035
那不管用
It's not working.

369
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,053
血不是问题  是腿的问题
Blood's not the problem. It's the leg.

370
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:06,088
血全汇集到那儿了

这个伤不是他摔下来得的
He didn't get this injury from a fall.

373
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,036
有东西压碎了他的腿

374
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:19,003
你做什么?
What are you doing?

375
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,058
你已经给他够多了
You've given him enough.

376
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,007
Hurley

377
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,086
伙计  你没事吧?  你看起来很不好
Whoa, dude. You all right, man? You're looking kinda goth.

378
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,012
-Michael在哪儿?  -我想在沙滩上
-Look, where's Michael? -Beach, I think.

我要你去帮我把他找来  好么?
I need you to go get him for me, okay?

380

去找就是了
Just get him.

381
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:15,098

很美妙
Ah... it's fantastic.

383
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,092
在头等舱里  我旁边坐了个很吵的小孩
Screaming kid next to me in first class.

384
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,011
怎么回事?
How does that happen, huh?

385
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,089
你在这儿干吗?
What you got there?

386
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:42,063
Sarah想让我们自己写誓言
Oh. Sarah wants us to write our own vows.

387
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:52,026
"我的心随着你话语的节奏跳跃着
"My heart skips beats at the sound of your voice.

388
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:56,095
我的皮肤...因你手指的触动而温暖

389
00:25:57,004 --> 00:26:01,004
你去哪儿  我就去哪儿"  等等等等
Where you go, I will go," etcetera, etcetera.

390
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,035
这个...这写得很好
This is...this is very nice.

391
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,011
这些不是我的誓言
Ha ha. Those aren't my vows.

392
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,061
那些是她的  我从房间里偷拿出来的
Those are hers. I stole them out of the room.

393
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,044
我写不出我的
I can't write mine.

394
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,053
当然  你是个医生不是个作家
Yeah, well, you're a doctor. You're not a writer.

395
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:17,019
-是的  -是的
-Right.  -Right.

396
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:26,072
Sarah是个漂亮的女孩
Sarah is a beautiful girl.

397
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,050
是的  她确实是
Hell yeah, she is.

398
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,034
你爱她?
You love her?

399
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,030
当然
Absolutely.

400
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,033
那么你为什么坐在这儿?
Then why are you sitting out here?

401
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:50,072
如果我不能成为我想成为的...
What if I can't be the husband or the...

402
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:53,011
丈夫或是父亲呢?
or the father that I want to be?

403
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,066
如果我问她嫁给我是因为...
What if I asked her because...

404
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,090
我救了她的命?
because I saved her life?

405
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:16,012
我应该娶她么  爸爸?
Should I marry her, dad?

406
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:27,023
勇于承担责任使你更有魅力  Jack
Commitment is what makes you tick, Jack.

407
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:31,043
问题在于
The problem is

408
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:34,003
你只是不擅于放弃
you're just not good at letting go.

409
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,093
那么你是说Locke说谎?
So you're saying Locke lied?

410
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:45,049
他的腿被什么东西压住了...很重的东西
His leg was pinned under something...something heavy.

411
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,050
好了  Jack  等等  货物箱
Okay, Jack, wait. The cargo container.

412
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:52,075
我们得这么做  用斧子怎么样?
We got to do this. What about the axe?

413
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:54,010
不能用斧子
Can't use the axe.

414
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,068
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

415
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,089
他的右腿被血充满了
His right leg is filling with blood.

416
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:05,020
如果我不制止  我就救不了他了
If I don't stop it, I won't be able to save him.

417
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,003
-你不是说...  -那腿废了
-You don't mean...  -The leg is dead.

418
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:24,013
没有别的选择了
There's no other choice.

419
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,072
Claire...

420
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:31,013
我想你该开始推挤了  可以么?
I think this is about the time you're supposed to start pushing, okay?

421
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,093
那么  推吧
So, uh, push.

422
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,027
还有...
And...

423
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:38,033
别憋气  亲爱的
don't hold your breath, honey.

424
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,098
如果你憋气的话  就没法推了...
You're not gonna be able to push if you hold...

425
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,011
Claire?

426
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,011
Claire  你在做什么?
Claire, what are you doing?

427
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,078
不不不不  Claire  你现在得推挤
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Claire, you need to push right now.

428
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:51,063
别这么做  Claire  好么?
Don't do this, Claire, okay?

429
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:53,059
事情发生了  你不能阻止它
You can't stop this. This is happening.

430
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,075
你的孩子快出来了  我需要你的配合
Your baby is coming, and I need your help.

431
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,059
孩子不会要我的
It's not going to want me.

432
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,035
孩子知道我不想要他  我想放弃
It knows I don't want it and I was gonna give it away.

433
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,006
孩子知道这些
Babies know that stuff.

434
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,015
你现在想要这个孩子么?
Do you want this baby now? Hmm?

435
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:18,035
你想让他安全健康的出生么?
Do you want it to be healthy and safe?

436
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:22,082
因为你的孩子也知道这些
Because your baby knows that, too.

437
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:26,054
你不是孤单面对  我们都陪着你
You're not alone in this. We are all here for you.

438
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,070
这个孩子是我们大家的
This baby is all of ours.

439
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:36,075
但是我需要你把他推出来  好么?
But I need you to push, okay?

440
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,078

450
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,057

452
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,031

数到3  1...
On 3. 1...

454
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:32,061
-Jack!  -2...

455
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,043
你为什么这么做?
Why are you doing this?

456
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:37,051
他内出血了
He's bleeding inside.

457
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,092
你不是在帮他!
You're not helping him!

458
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:42,014
你救不了他  Jack  你做不到
You can't save him, Jack! You just can't.

459
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,094
别跟我说我有什么做不到的!
Don't tell me what I can't do!

460
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,077
好了  1  2  3  抬  好的
Okay. 1, 2, 3, go. All right.

461
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,032
你不用看
You don't need to see this.

462
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:22,002
如果需要尽管叫我
If you need me, shout.

463
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:12,099
无论健康或是生病
In sickness, in health,

464
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,038
无论幸福还是痛苦...
in good times and bad...

465
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:22,020
我都接受  因为我爱你
I risk it all because I love you.

466
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:24,028
谢谢  Sarah
Thank you, Sarah.

467
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,007
Jack也准备了他的誓言
Jack has also prepared his vows.

468
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:29,069
Jack  你愿意的话  可以开始了
Jack, if you would, please.

469
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,044
Jack?

470
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:50,068
我没写任何誓言
I didn't write any vows.

471
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,095
我想了一个月  但是...
I've been trying to for a month, but...

472
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:57,099
我写不出  而且...
I couldn't, and...

473
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,098
我开始想那是为什么
so I started to wonder why that was.

474
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:07,024
随着时间过去  只有更糟
And as time went on, it only got worse,

475
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:09,062
因为我...
because I'm...

476
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,075
因为我不太擅长放弃
because I'm not good at letting go.

477
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:20,046
或者说也许我是害怕失败
Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail.

478
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:26,032
但是我知道一件事
But I know one thing.

479
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,070
我永远也写不出
I would have never been able to write anything

480
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,085
你刚才说的这么动人的誓言
as beautiful as what you just said.

481
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,010
昨晚  Sarah  当你在说那场事故的时候
And last night, Sarah, when you were talking about the accident,

482
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,008
你全错了
you got it all wrong.

483
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:44,043
我没有治好你
I didn't fix you.

484
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,037
是你治好了我
You fixed me.

485
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,021
我爱你  Sarah
I love you, Sarah,

486
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:59,053
永远爱你
and I always will.

487
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:26,010
等等
Wait.

488
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,057
等等
Wait.

489
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,054
我不得不这样
I have to.

490
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:36,082
如果不这样...
If I don't...

491
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:39,016
我体内一团糟
I'm all messed up inside.

492
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,098
你知道
You know it.

493
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:45,062

我是说...
I mean...

497
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,068
看看我们在哪儿

498

我不会让你放弃的
I'm not gonna let you give up.

我知道你许了...
I know you made...

500
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,013
一个诺言

501

我来让你解脱吧
I'm letting you off the hook.

502
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,074
让我去吧  Jack
Let me go, Jack.

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:58,041
