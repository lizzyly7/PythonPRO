3
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:14,067
我在海滩上发现了电缆
I found the wire on the beach.

4
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:16,057
我想可能与我们
I thought it might have something to do

5
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:18,055
接收到的信号有关
with a transmission we picked up,

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,077
一个法国女人不停的发射了16年
a Frenchwoman repeating on a loop for 16 years.

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:23,076
真的有那么久吗?
Has it really been that long?

8
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:25,095
你在这个岛上还见过其他人吗?
Have you seen other people on this island?

9
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,025
但是我听见了他们说话
But I hear them.

10
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,025
他们窃窃私语
They whisper.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,098
我们得离开这个岛
We need to get off this island.

12
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:33,030
你在暗示什么吗?
Are you suggesting something?

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,001
是的
Yeah.

14
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:35,074
我们造了一个筏子
We build a raft.

15
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:37,059
进展的不错啊
You're making a lot of progress.

16
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,020
是的  努力在做
Yeah, trying.

17
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:41,000
我把竹子铺在上面
Got this bamboo for the decking,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,064
留一些空间来做船舱
a piece of the fuselage for the cabin.

19
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:44,058
会弄好的
It'll work.

20
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,058
我们能搞定
We can do this.

21
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,042
最近每天下午都在下雨
It's been raining every afternoon.

22
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,052
那意味着季风季节已经到了
That means that we are on the cusp of monsoon season.

23
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,097
我们为什么要听Arzt的?
Why are we listening to Arzt?

24
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:54,071
你只不过是个高中老师
You're a damn high school science teacher.

25
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,080
我只是在想你们不会想死吧?
I was just assuming you didn't want to die.

26
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,011
那么我们该什么时候走?
So when do we have to leave?

27
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,041
昨天
Yesterday.

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,012
你在干什么?
What're you doing?

29
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,048
看电视
Watching TV.

30
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:32,082
你知道现在是什么时间吗? 赶快去睡觉  Walt
Oh, man, you see what time it is? Go back to sleep, Walt.

31
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,022
我一直都在看这个节目
I always watch this show.

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,035
好吧  那么...
Okay, then.

33
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,060
你能不能把声音调低点?
Could you at least turn it down?

34
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:45,025
我说的是把声音调低  Walt
I said turn it down, Walt.

35
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:46,047
我过去看这个节目时 Brian从来不管我调多大声音
Brian lets me watch it as loud as...

36
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,087
我不是Brian
I'm not Brian.

37
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,040
气死我了
Dang.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,026
-我们走 Vincent  -嘿  你要去哪里?
-Let's go, Vincent.  -Hey, where are you going? Hey!

39
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,043
Walt!

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,015
离我远点! 不要管我!
Get away from me. Leave me alone.

41
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:59,032
-不要想... 不要从我身边离开!  -我说了 离我远点
-Don't even... Don't you think...  -I said get away from me.

42
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,050
Walt 听着 我不这样认为
I don't think so. Come on.

43
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,043
放开我!
Get off of me!

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,051
听着  我也不喜欢这样
I don't like this, either.

45
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,091
但是你必须上飞机
But you're getting on that plane.

46
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:06,079
不  我才不想去呢

47
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:08,083
-发生了什么  -没什么  我是他父亲
-What's going on?  -It's okay. I'm his father.

48
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:10,031
不  你不是我父亲
You're not my father!

49
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,031
你不是我父亲
You're not my father!

50
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:43,004
-爸爸! 爸爸  醒醒  -什么事?
-Dad, wake up!  -What?

51
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:46,012
-什么事?  -有人来了!
-What?  -Somebody's here.

52
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:51,063
停下来!
Hey! Hey! Stop!

53
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,009
慢...慢点儿
Slow, slow down.

54
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,052
那是谁?
Who is that?

55
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,068
那肯定是那个法国女人
Gotta be the French chick.

56
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,066
大家冷静
Calm down, everyone.

57
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,012
没什么
It's all right.

58
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,044
Danielle?

59
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,073
Danielle?

60
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,048
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:29,069
"The others"要来了
The others are coming.

62

65
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,028
我们的船16年到达这个岛
Our ship went aground on this island 16 years ago.

66
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,004
当时我们有六个人
There were six of us.

67
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:56,045
我们小组  六个人
My team. Six.

68
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,019
那时候
By that time,

69
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:02,008
我已经怀孕七个月了
I was already seven months pregnant.

70
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,080
孩子在我手里抱着
I delivered the infant myself.

71
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:11,045
当时孩子和我在一起只有一个星期
The baby and I were together for only one week,

72
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:14,023
然后我看见了黑烟
when I saw black smoke.

73
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,002
5公里远处冒出缕缕黑烟
A pillar of black smoke five kilometers inland.

74
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,076
那天晚上...
That night...

75
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,077
他们来了
they came.

76
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,009
他们来了...
they came...

77
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,055
带走了她
and took her.

78
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,030
Alex

79
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:37,094
他们抢走了我的孩子
They took my baby.

80
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,032
而现在...
And now...

81
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,092
他们又来了
they're coming again.

82
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,047
冲着你们所有的人
They're coming for all of you.

83
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,020
谁要来?
Who's coming?

84
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,077
The others

85
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,018
你们只有三个选择
You have only three choices.

86
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,088
逃跑...
Run...

87
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:57,017
藏起来...
Hide...

88
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,097
或者死
Or die.

89
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:05,023
这个女人炸掉了自己的藏身之处
This is a woman who blew up her own shelter.

90
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,034
而现在她又在谈论什么看见黑烟和听见低声细语
Now she talks about black smoke and hearing whispers.

91
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,068
我的意思是说 她是不是疯了
She's not playing with a full deck.

92
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,070
那并不意味着她说的就不是真的
That doesn't mean what she's saying isn't true.

93
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:14,030
那么 假如你相信她说的  随便你
If you wanna focus on the "what ifs", be my guest.

94
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,074
但是我要去做些实际的东西
I'm sticking with the tangible,

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,039
现在要做的就是
and right now that's

96
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,039
让筏子下水
the launching of the raft.

97
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,022
弄得怎么样了?
How's it going?

98
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,099
我想今天离开
I wanted to get off today,

99
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,056
但是  实际上
but realistically,man,

100
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:24,052
把舵弄好后
after we get the rudder done,

101
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:27,036
我们仍然需要铺滚木把它弄下水
we still gotta lay the rails to get her down to the water.

102
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:31,071
但是在你弄舵的同时 我们铺设滚木不是更快?
Wouldn't it save time to lay the rails while you are finishing the rudder?

103
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,096
人手不够
Manpower shortage.

104
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,007
你需要什么来铺设滚木和移动船?
What do you need to lay the rails and move the boat?

105
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,065
今天全部完成?
Get it all done today?

106
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,028
所有的人倒差不多
Pretty much everybody.

107
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,092
好吧  给我20分钟
All right, give me 20 minutes.

108
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:48,075
找到尽可能多的圆木
Grab as many palm tree logs as you can find,

109
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,072
越长越好
the longer the better,

110
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,096
把它们拿到筏子那里   Michael知道怎么使用它们
take them over to the raft area.Michael knows what to do with them.

111
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:53,035
好的 一会见
See ya then.

112
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,062
你要把它们绑紧
You need to get 'em in there tight,

113
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:57,082
用杠杆把它弄上轨道
and you need leverage to get 'em on the rails.

114
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,070
知道了  好的
Yeah, that's good.

115
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,089
好  干的不错
Good. That's good.

116
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,098
好  干的不错兄弟
Okay, that's good, man.

117
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,010
一定要稳住  好吗?
Just get it under there, okay?

118
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,076
好的
Okay.

119
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,065
-你还好吧?  -是的
-You all right?  -Yep.

120
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:13,042
大家听着我数数
So listen, on my count,

121
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,024
我会喊 "1 2 3"
I'll do, "one, two, three, lift,"

122
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:17,025
抬起来然后推 明白了么?
and then push, okay?

123
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:18,096
知道了?
Got it?

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,043
好吧  来吧
Okay, come on.

125
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,069
一旦我们把它弄到了吃水线
Once it's down to the water line,

126
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,067
我们就放下来 然后装上东西
we'll drop it and load it up.

127
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,060
好了
All right.

128
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,023
准备好
Ready?

129
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,023
开始了

130
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,054

推!

135
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,010
加油  同志们!

136
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,058
推!
Push. Push!

137
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,084
用杠杆!
Use your levers.

138
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,023
好了  干的好  干的好
Yeah. Good, good.

139
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,061
1  2  3! 抬起来!
One, two, three, lift.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,044
保持好方向!
Hey, keep it straight.

141
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,074
噢  不!
Oh, no! Come on!

142
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,089
真不敢相信!
I can't believe this.

143
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,017
真难以置信
Can't believe it.

144
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,089
你看我干什么 又不是我的错
What are you looking at me for?

145
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,024
你没控制好杠杆
You missed the lever!

146
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:27,040
就是因为你才不能控制好方向
You couldn't keep the raft straight!

147
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,097
我不能控制好方向
I couldn't keep it straight?

148
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,053
爸爸!  看!
Dad! Look.

149
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:56,005
他们有多少人?
How many of them are there?

150
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,050
我把知道的都告诉你们了
I told you all I know.

151
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,095
肯定还有什么你没有告诉我们 你是怎么知道的?
There has to be more to tell. How did you know?

152
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,052
你们最大的麻烦就是
You have a bigger problem.

153
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,029
我可以藏到树丛里
I can vanish into the jungle,

154
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,029
我只有一个人
but I'm just one person.

155
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:08,027
你们有40个人
You have 40 people.

156
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,069
他们可以藏在哪里?
Where will you hide them?

00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:26,068
伙计  哇哦
Dude. Whoa.

158
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,000

我们希望你能告诉我们
We hoped you could tell us.

160
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,091
从来没见过这种东西
I've never seen anything like it.

161
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,027
呃  有个问题
Uh, question.

162
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:43,036
怎么把所有的人都藏到里面去?
How do you know we can all, like, fit in there?

163
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,011
外面没有把手
No handle outside,

164
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,003
意味着肯定有其他方法可以进去
must be another way in.

165
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,009
-另外一个地方意味着空地  -这是一个错误
-Another entrance means space.  -This is a mistake.

166
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,003
我们对"The others"一无所知
We don't know about these others.

167
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,043
我们在没有信息
We're reacting with no information,

168
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:53,043
没有智慧的情况下反抗
no intelligence.

169
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:55,027
这个仓口也许就是他们的
This might even be theirs.

170
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,078
地平线上的黑烟并不意味着...
Black smoke that are rising doesn't mean...

171
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:58,091
那意味着他们要来了
It means they're coming.

172
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,022
没错 我们都知道
Yeah, we got that.

173
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,097
你藏身地方的陷阱有炸药
You booby-trapped your shelter with explosives.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
剩下的还有吗?
You have any more?

175
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,092
在黑岩那里
At the Black Rock.

176
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,061
黑暗地带
In the Dark Territory.

177
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,054
这下可好 有三个理由能去那里了
That's three reasons to go right there.

178
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,014
要想在日落前回来
If we're to make it back by sunset,

179
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,020
必须在一小时之内出发
we have to leave within the hour.

180
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:40,007
加柠檬的龙色兰酒
Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon.

181
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:48,020
你们为什么事吵架?
Why were you yelling?

182
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:54,064
服务台的那个女孩
The girl at the check-in counter.

183
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,048
你冲她又喊又叫的
You were yelling at her.

184
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,079
不好意思 恩...
I'm sorry, uh...

185
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,073
咱们认识么?
do I know you?

186
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:05,047
我和你一趟航班  去洛山机
I'm on your flight. LA.

187
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,060
你父亲死了  是么?
So, your dad died, huh?

188
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,047
我想你肯定不知道我为什么又喊又叫
I thought you didn't hear what I was yelling about.

189
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,009
我并不想冒犯
I was being polite.

190
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,079
我父亲去世了
my dad died.

191
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,005
因为什么?
How?

192
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,023
心脏病发作
A heart attack.

193
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:33,035
不是因为喝酒  是吧?
Not a drinker, huh?

194
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,012
不  不  不全是
No, not really.

195
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,045
没有戒指是因为你单身还是因为你不喜欢戴?
No ring 'cause you're single or because you don't like wearing one?

196
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,054
你是问我结婚没有?
You asking me if I'm married?

197
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,019
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

198
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,041
没有  没有  不再是了
No, not anymore.

199
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:02,045
要再来一杯加柠檬的龙色兰酒吗?
Can we get another tequila and tonic, please?

200
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:07,058
我想你没有听我说话
I didn't think you were listening.

201
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,057
那么你叫什么名字?
So, what's your name?

202
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,043
Ana-Lucia
Ana-Lucia

203
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,087
那告诉我  Ana-Lucia
So, tell me, Ana-Lucia,

204
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:20,021
你为什么在早上10点喝加柠檬的龙色兰酒?
why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon?

205
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,014
我讨厌坐飞机
I hate flying.

206
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,081
而他们让我坐在飞机的后部
And they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane

207
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:29,019
起落架就在我脚下
where the wheels come down right under your damn feet.

208
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,043
那么你坐哪儿?
So, where are you sitting?

209
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,094
23B

210
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,044
42F

211
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,051
想要换着坐吗?
Wanna trade?

212
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:49,004
是的  我在Sydney
Hey. Yeah, I'm in Sydney.

213
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,004
稍等
Hold on.

214
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,054
不好意思
Sorry...

215
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,082
Uh, Jack.

216
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:57,025
Jack  我要回电话
Jack. I gotta talk.

217
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,027
到飞机上再喝  好吗?
Um... we'll have the next drink on the plane, okay?

218
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,035
42F  没错
42 F. Right.

219
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,011
还有  Jack...
And, Jack?

220
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,065
不好的事情都已经过去了
The worst part's over.

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,008
听着  我知道每个人都很害怕
Look, I know you're all scared.

222
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:27,099
而且我也知道每个人都有很多问题要问
And I know that everybody has a lot of questions.

223
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,082
我现在能告诉大家的就是我们有一个计划
All I can tell you right now is that we do have a plan.

224
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,064
我们要到丛林里拿些补给
We've got to go into the jungle for supplies.

225
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,060
几个小时后回来
We'll be back in a few hours.

226
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:42,035
同时  尽一切可能帮Michael把筏子弄下水
In the meantime, do everything you can to help Michael get that raft on the water.

227
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:45,032
完成后  到山洞那里去
And after that, go to the caves.

228
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:49,024
我们会尽快回来  我保证
We'll be back as soon as we can. I promise.

229
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,086
说的好
Hey, nice speech.

230
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:55,063
计划虽然有点缺陷  但是  没有什么是完美的
Plan's a little flawed, but nobody's perfect.

231
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,031
是的  你的计划  你要到丛林里去
Your plan. Go in the jungle,

232
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,005
拿些炸药  炸开仓口
and get dynamite and blow open a hatch,

233
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,076
然后你要把大家藏在里面
and then hide everyone inside.

234
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,070
你想保持秘密  就不要告诉那个胖子
You wanna keep a secret,don't tell the fat guy.

235
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,093
你想要干什么Arzt?
What do you want, Arzt?

236
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,053
天知道炸药离这里有多远
God knows how long that dynamite might has been out there.

237
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:17,063
但是从我的判断  那个疯狂的夫人并不关心这个
And from what I can tell,Madame Nutsodoesn't seem too concerned with how to handle it.

238
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,072
所以除非你想放弃计划
So unless you want to blow up

239
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,066
带上我一起去
I'm coming with you.

240
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,059
没问题
Okay.

241
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:29,032
找些水  我们半小时后出发
Grab some water bottles.We're leaving in a half an hour.

242
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,022
绳索还可以用  但是我们需要新的桅杆
We can salvage the cables, but we need new bamboo for the mast.

243
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:40,015
我们需要在开始前弄好方向舵
We need to fix the rudder before we even start to think about that.

244
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,019
-需要帮忙吗?  -首先把这个做好
-You need help?  Let's get this done first.

245
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:46,092
这不是我的错
Hey, this wasn't my fault.

246
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,058
让我一起帮忙吧
So put me to work.

247
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,084
不想冒犯 只是这样我们能更快些  好吗?
No offense.We just work faster this way, okay?

248
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:55,057
没错 就是这样   你认为我在这里干什么?
All right! What do you think I'm doing over here?

249
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,028
还认识我么?
You remember me?

250
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,002
三天前
Three nights ago.

251
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,052
你因为打架被带到这里
You were hauled in here thrashing and fighting.

252
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:10,012
来得时候  还踢坏了我的桌子
As you were being escorted by,you kicked my desk.

253
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:12,046
打坏了我杯子
And you broke my mug.

254
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,053
漂亮的小孩
Nice kids.

255
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,004
对你来说是悲哀的
Sadly for you,

256
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:19,031
打坏我的杯子不是你那天晚上犯的最大的错误
breaking my mug was not the most significant mistake you made that evening.

257
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:22,001
算了吧  博士  我不过是参与了一次酒吧打架
Come on, doctor.I got into a bar fight.

258
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,051
在这个国家那不是一种荣誉吗?
Ain't that a badge of honor in this country?

259
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,005
你知道在那个酒吧里被你用头撞的人是谁么?
You know who you head-butted in that bar?

260
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:29,042
你撞的是可敬的Warren Truss
You head-butted the Honorable Warren Truss...

261
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,070
农业  渔业和林业部长
...Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Forestry.

262
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,053
-最重要的一个  -是他用头撞我
-One of the most important...  -He head-butted me.

263
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,019
我们有证人证明他没有做
We have witnesses.He did no such thing.

264
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,043
当然
Course.

265
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:44,086
你认为这很好笑  James?
You think this is funny, James?

266
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,094
James Ford

267
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:54,097
伤害  电报诈骗  偷窃  银行诈骗  电话诈骗
Assault, wire fraud,identity theft, bank fraud,telemarketing fraud...

268
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:58,036
你是个垃圾
You're a blight, a stain, scavenger.

269
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,082
你是一个骗子  欺骗那些弱者和穷人
You're a con man preying11 on the weak and needy.

270
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,082
告诉我James 你怎样生活下来的?
Tell me something, James,how do you live with yourself?

271
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,024
我没干坏事
I do just fine.

272
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,079
真的么?
Do you?

273
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,005
你甚至不值得我们把你关进监狱
You're not even worth the cost to incarcerate you.

274
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:16,024
你被驱逐了
Which is why you're being deported.

275
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,025
今天下午坐飞机离开
Your plane leaves this afternoon.

276
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,043
还有  James
And, James,

277
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,046
你不准再踏进澳大利亚一步
you're banned from ever setting foot in Australia again.

278
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,089
你不必担心
Don't you worry.

279
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,038
-我再也不会回来了  -最好别回来  兄弟
-I ain't ever coming back here.  -Best not, mate.

280
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,063
伐木工人
A lumberjack.

281
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:51,009
什么?
Scuse me?

282
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,073
从来没有问过你你是干什么的  所以...
I never asked what you did back in the real world.

283
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:55,067
随便猜的
So I'm taking a wild guess.

284
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,032
伐木工人
Lumberjack.

285
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,013
有什么需要我帮忙的吗  医生? 因为我有事要做
Something I can help you with, doc?Cause I got work to do.

286
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,050
给你带来个东西
I got something for you.

287
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,064
你是要上筏子的人中唯一知道怎么用枪的人
You're the only one on the raft who knows how to use one.

288
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,083
我要枪干什么?
What do I need a gun for?

289
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,083
只是以放万一
Just in case.

290
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,094
你认为我们会用尽食物和水?
You think we're gonna run outta food and water?

291
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,063
我是不是应该让孩子远离痛苦?
I put the kid out of his misery?

292
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:19,061
只是以放万一
Just in case.

293
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,002
剩下的你打算怎么处理?
What're you doing with the rest of them?

294
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,048
交给Sayid了
Giving 'em to Sayid.

295
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,067
消失在丛林中 对吧?
Going into the jungle after the boomsticks, huh?

296
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,027
是啊
Yeah.

297
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,054
你们回来时  我们已经乘船走了
Time you get back,we'll be in the water.

298
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,019
这很可能就是再见了
Guess this is pretty much goodbye then.

299
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,010
是的  我想是了
Yeah, I guess it is.

300
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,003
祝你好运  Sawyer
Good luck, Sawyer.

301
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,032
大约在上飞机的前一周
About a week before we all got on the plane,

302
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,090
在悉尼的一个酒吧里和一个人聊天
I got to talking to this man in a bar in Sydney.

303
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,072
他也是美国人
He was an American too.

304
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,088
一个医生
A doctor.

305
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,064
我经历了些狂欢时光  但是这个人
I've been on some benders in my time,

306
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,022
他在争取时间记录
but this guy was going for an all-time record.

307
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,069
他有个儿子
So it turns out this guy has a son.

308
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,020
儿子也是个医生
Son's a doctor too.

309
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,074
他们曾经大吵了一场
They'd had some kinda big-time falling out.

310
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,014
这个人知道那是他的错
The guy knew it was his fault...

311
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:36,039
显然他的儿子也是这么认为的
even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing.

312
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,092
你知道  孩子就像狗
See, kids are like dogs.

313
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,078
假如你对他们太严厉了
You knock 'em around enough,

314
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,067
他们会认为他们做错了什么
they'll think they did something to deserve it.

315
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,059
无论如何...
Anyway...

316
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,067
酒吧里有个付费电话
there's a pay phone in this bar,

317
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,070
这个人...
and this guy...

318
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,093
基督徒
Christian...

319
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,009
告诉我他有硬币想给他儿子打电话
tells me he wishes he had the stonesto pick up the phone and call his kid.

320
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,051
对他说"对不起"
Tell him he's sorry.

321
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,005
他是一个比他还出色的医生
That he's a better doctor than he'll ever be.

322
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,069
他非常骄傲
He's proud.

323
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,011
我必须中断  但是...
I had to take off...

324
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,015
感觉告诉我他后来一直没有打那个电话
but something tells me he never made that call.

325
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,033
世界真小   不是么?
Small world, huh?

326
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,018
是啊
Yeah.

327
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,006
保重  Jack
Good luck, Jack.

328
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,004
-你要全副武装?  -是的  先生  手枪
-You're gonna be armed?  -Yes, sir, an ankle holster.

329
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:28,026
你必须把这些东西放在行李仓前面的间隔间里
Stow this in the crew luggage compartment in front.

330
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,045
没有问题
No problemo.

331
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,009
你为什么要带五支枪?
Why do you need five guns?

332
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:36,054
你想告诉他吗 Kate?
Gee, you wanna tell him, Kate?

333
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:39,027
为什么我要带五支枪?
Why do I need five guns?

334
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,083
她不好意思了
She's shy.

335
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,041
那么这是什么?
What's this, then?

336
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,003
那是一个有趣的故事
That's a good story.

337
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,024
你想要说吗  kate?
You wanna tell it?Huh, Kate?

338
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:58,000
这东西是属于她的青梅竹马的
This belonged to her childhood sweetheart,

339
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:02,070
几年前在逃跑中被杀了
who she got killed a couple of years ago when she was on the run.

340
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:06,000
可怜的家伙   有一个妻子和一个两岁大的孩子
Poor guy. Had a wife.Two-year-old kid.

341
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,000
他叫什么来着?
What was his name?

342
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:13,063
这几年 在我追捕她的过程中  某个地方
Somewhere along the way during the three years I was chasing her,

343
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:20,062
她开始给我家里打电话询问怎样才能减轻罪行
she starts calling me at my house,and whining on about her mitigating circumstances.

344
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,043
但是她真正想做的...
But what she's really doing...

345
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,088
是奚落我
is taunting me.

346
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:31,023
所以我告诉她情人的玩具飞机
So I tell her that I've got what's-his-name's little toy airplane

347
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:35,026
在新墨西哥城的一个保险箱里
in a safe deposit box in New Mexico.

348
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,020
当她弄明白是哪个银行 哪个保险箱时
So she somehow figures out which bank,which safe deposit box.

349
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,041
骗一些白痴抢劫了那个银行
She seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank,

350
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,006
然后在利用完那个白痴后将其杀害
then puts a bullet in her new friend because she's done using him.

351
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:51,090
但是她分文不要
But she leaves all the money.

352
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,076
只拿走了这个飞机
She just takes the plane.

353
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,093
因为那是在她生命里唯一在乎的东西
Because that's the one thing in the whole world that Kate does care about.

354
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,062
她没有感情...
She has no attachments...

355
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:08,052
我想她告诉她自己
And I think she's telling herself

356
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:12,086
她需要这个来补偿他的男友...
She needs it to atone for killing her boyfriend,

357
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:13,086
他叫什么名字?
what's-his-name.

358
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,091
Kate  别这样  他叫什么来着?
Come on.What was his name?

359
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,016
Tom  你个贱人  啊!
Tom!It was Tom, you son of a bitch!

360
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:29,079
那就是我为什么需要五支枪
And that is why I need five guns.

361
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:49,035
你要去?
You're heading out?

362
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,042

363
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,003
我在想也许我应该和你一起去
I was thinking that I might go with you...

364
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,094
因为以前那些事
for old time's sake.

365
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,086
我想要帮忙
I wanna help.

366
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:08,090
你不想在这里帮忙让筏子下水
You won't be here for the raft launching.

367
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,053
是的

我不擅长说再见

我们要上筏子了
It's going on the raft.

You know, "Dear Mom,everything's fine. I'm on the island.

377
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:43,094
瓶中信

我的小组在这里被感染
when my team got infected,

415
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,008

422
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,027
那炸药怎么办?
What about the dynamite?

只要小心点就可以了
Just be very careful with it.

432
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:27,086
我们是把它安装上呢还是继续在这里调侃?
Are we gonna get off this rock or just stand around talking about it?

433
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,056
你们听见了吗?
Did you hear that?

434
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,022

445

这个岛

兄弟  我还以为你死了呢

我们赶紧去把炸药弄来好不?
