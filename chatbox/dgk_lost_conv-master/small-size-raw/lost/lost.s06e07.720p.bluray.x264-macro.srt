1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,060
"迷失" 前情提要...
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,700
- 这儿刻了一堆名字 Jacob在哪?  - 我不知道
- There are names. Where's Jacob?  - I don't know.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,370
- 为什么我的名字 会写在这上面?  - 他没告诉我
- Why is my name written down on this thing?  - He didn't tell me.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,150
- 他想从我这儿得到什么?  - 我得确保把你和Jack一起
- What does he want from me?  - I had to get you and Jack

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,880
- 从神庙那儿叫过来  - 什么? 为什么?
- as far away from that temple as I possibly could.  - What? Why?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,380
因为有人马上就要去那儿了
'Cause someone's coming there.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,060
很坏的人
Someone bad.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,840
- 要走还来得及  - 我不走
- There's still time.  - Not for me.

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,690
- 喔!  - 哦!
- Whoa!  - Oh!

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,350
Jarrah在哪?
Where's Jarrah?

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,460
我没事 谢谢
I'm fine. Thank you.

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,750
- 他在哪?!  - 他刚刚杀了Dogen
- Where is he?!  - Considering that he just killed Dogen,

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,180
- 我想他不会乐意和我们凑成堆  - Dogen是谁?
- I don't think he's gonna be joining us.  - Who's Dogen?

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,780
- 寺庙里主事的那个人  - Sayid把翻译官也杀了
- The guy in charge of the temple.  - Sayid killed the interpreter, too.

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,140
- 你没搞错吧?  - 他站在他们的尸体旁
- Are you sure?  - He was standing over their dead bodies

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,920
手里拿着把血淋淋的匕首 所以 嗯 我确定无疑
holding a bloody dagger, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,560
你之前还说躲在寺庙里很安全
You said we were safe at the temple.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,300
- 别人也是这么跟我说的  - 呃 海滩那边怎样了?
- That's what I was told.  - Well, what about the beach?

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,770
- 什么海滩?  - 我们埋了Locke的那个海滩 他们住过的那个海滩
- What beach?  - Where we buried Locke, where they lived.

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,080
至少在那儿 我们还能弄到水
At least we'll have the water at our backs,

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,260
而且地形也熟悉 还有人有更好的建议么?
and it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea?

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,570
- 没 就去海滩吧  - 走那边
- No. The beach it is.  - That way.

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,350
走吧
Move.

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,170
... 就是在这座岛上 命运发生了转变
... and it was on this island that everything changed,

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,270
最终尘埃落定...
that everything finally became clear...

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,570
厄尔巴岛...
Elba...

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,580
正是拿破仑东山再起的发源地
is where Napoleon faced his greatest task.

28
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,360
因为他最悲惨的下场 不是受到流放
Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,930
真正让他无法忍受的 是权力的剥夺
What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
当然 他们允许他保留皇帝的头衔
Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of Emperor.

31
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,750
然而有名无实 毫无意义
But without any power, it was meaningless.

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,680
他还不如死了更痛快
He might just as well have been dead.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,440
好吧 记得 明天五六节课我们继续 谢谢
All right, remember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
Reynolds校长 上午好
Principal Reynolds. Good morning.

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,760
跟我来
Walk with me.

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,250
Linus 轮值表稍微调整了下
Linus, there's been a slight schedule shift.

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,920
今天放学后
I'm going to need you to supervise detention

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,420
- 你去监管那些留堂生  - 什么?
- after school today.  - What?

39
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,500
确切说 这周每天都是你
In fact, all week.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,820
裁员 资金周转不灵 还有许多你不了解的麻烦事
Cutbacks, budget crises, events above your pay grade.

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,570
毫无疑问 我们一个人得当两个用
Needless to say, some of us have to pull double duty.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,000
但今天历史社团有活动啊
But we have history club today.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,900
- 孩子们等着我呢...  - 历史社团只有5个学生 Linus
- Those kids need me...  - There are five students in history club, Linus.

44
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,011
- 少了你 他们不会死的  - 我们不能找个 更胜任此事的人么?
- They'll live.  - Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?

45
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,031
得了吧 那个社团对他们来说无所谓 但对你不同
Spare me. The club isn't for them. It's for you.

46
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,191
这让你有被需求感
It makes you feel needed.

47
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,331
不幸的是 现在留堂生真的需要你
Unfortunately for now, you're needed in detention.

48
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,181
多谢配合 Linus
Thanks for your understanding, Linus.

49
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:54,181
其实 你该叫我Linus博士
It's Dr. Linus, actually.

50
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,711
哦 我可爱的... 毁了!
Oh, for the love of... It's ruined!

51
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,161
- 全毁了! 哦!  - 出... 什么事了 Leslie?
- It's ruined! Ohh!  - What's... what's the problem, Leslie?

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,641
哦 福尔马林 沾到... 福尔马林了
Oh, formaldehyde. For... formaldehyde's the problem.

53
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:08,431
你知道有什么能洗掉福尔马林么? 没有
You know what gets out formaldehyde? Nothin'.

54
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,641
要是我有件实验室工作服
Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons,

55
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,191
我就不用因为班上那些废物
I wouldn't have to pay for our incompetent students

56
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,621
再跑去Marshalls 买过一件衣服了
with another trip to Marshalls.

57
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:17,482
- 都是为了减少预算  - Reynolds难道就不能为了
- Budget cutbacks.  - How hard would it be for Reynolds

58
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,272
科学知识的传播 稍微放点儿血么?
to spread around a little of the love to the sciences?

59
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:21,922
我从上个世纪五十年代开始 就跟实验器材打交道
You know. I'm dealing with lab equipment in there from the 1950s.

60
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:25,412
- 他干嘛搞成这样?  - Reynolds校长说了算
- Now why is that?  - Principal Reynolds is an administrator.

61
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,472
他不是老师 他早忘了
He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what

62
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,532
公立学校是啥体制的了
the public school system is about.

63
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,133
嗯 作为啥狗屁养老金的交换条件 暑假不放假
Yeah, summers off in exchange for a crap pension.

64
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,173
我得记得提醒他
I'm happy to remind him.

65
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:37,543
不 照顾好孩子 这才是关键
No, taking care of the kids. That's what's important.

66
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,033
好啦 你还一门心思在教学啊
Okay. You just keep dreamin'.

67
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:42,643
哦 我知道你已经不搭理这一套了 但... 我不会放弃的
Oh, I know you've given up, but... I refuse to.

68
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,773
或许你才配当校长
Maybe you should be the principal.

69
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,853
别人也这么说
So says the substitute.

70
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,083
我才配当校长 你为什么这么说呢?
What do you mean, I should be the principal?

71
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,413
听上去 你很在乎这所学校
It just sounds like you care about this place.

72
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:58,773
如果现任校长不在乎
And if the man in charge doesn't,

73
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:01,163
那就到该换人的时候了
then maybe it's time for a change.

74
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,973
我同意你的看法 但谁会听我的?
I appreciate the sentiment, but who's gonna listen to me?

75
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,293
我就听着呢
I'm listenin'.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
不如你告诉我 回那儿去的东西是什么?
How about you tell me what that thing back there was?

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,620
- 那东西在雕像后杀了她的朋友  - 还杀了Jacob 对么?
- That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue.  - And Jacob, right?

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,540
它也杀了Jacob
It killed Jacob, too.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,420
嗯 当然 还杀了Jacob
Yeah, of course. And Jacob.

80
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
当然
Of course.

81
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,410
你叫Miles 对么?
You're Miles, right?

82
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,650
全名Miles Straume?
Miles Straume?

83
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,840
你可以和死者谈话
You communicate with the dead.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,740
准确地说 不行 我...
Not technically. I...

85
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,050
我可以告诉你 人是怎么死的
I can tell you how someone died,

86
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,910
分辨出他们死前的最后一丝想法
pick up their last thoughts before they check out,

87
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,120
但我需要靠近他们的身边
but I need to be near their bodies.

88
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,700
这是从Jacob身上掉下来的
This is what's left of Jacob's body.

89
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:59,957
那么告诉我 Miles 他是怎么死的?
So tell me, Miles, how did he die?

90
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,377
Linus杀了他
Linus killed him.

91
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,727
什么?
What?

92
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,627
他瞎说
That's not true.

93
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:43,237
你确定?
Are you sure?

94
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,037
呃 他站在Jacob尸体旁边
Well, he was standing over Jacob's dead body

95
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,717
手上还拿着把血淋淋的匕首 所以... 嗯 我很确定
with a bloody dagger, so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.

96
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,807
谢谢
Thank you.

97
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,637
Jacob对我来说 就像爸爸一样
Jacob was the closest thing I ever had to a father.

98
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,077
啊哦
Uh-oh.

99
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:32,147

迷失 第6季第7集

100
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,407
我要找些工具
I'm gonna look for some tools

101
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,577
把住的地方收拾出来
and get to work on some shelter.

102
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,907
剩下的人 看看还有什么能吃的 或者生个火
The rest of you, see what food's left, maybe get a fire going.

103
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,847
对哦 生火可以搞定一切
Yeah, a fire'll fix everything.

104
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:23,677
你要我做些什么吗?
Is there anything you'd like me to do?

105
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:38,337
通灵这玩意儿... 太不靠谱了
You know, psychics... totally unreliable.

106
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:42,787
Miles还想敲诈我...
Miles actually tried to blackmail me once into...

107
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,737
你很会交朋友嘛 啊?
You make friends easy, don't ya?

108
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,697
啊 啊
Ah. Ah.

109
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,707
除此之外 他们还要再得
And on top of that, they'll have to convert

110
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,927
两分才能扳平比分
on a 2-point conversion to make it a tie game.

111
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,157
我给你做了顿火鸡大餐
I made you one of the turkey meals

112
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,937
用了你喜欢的红莓果酱哦
with the cranberry sauce that you like.

113
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:17,297
又是一顿营养均衡的大餐吧?
It ain't one of them "lean" deals, is it?

114
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,917
是的 爸爸 这是有机食品
No. Dad. It's organic.

115
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,967
我想让你保持身体健康
I'm trying to keep you healthy.

116
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,817
貌似有点晚了吧
Well, it's a little too late for that.

117
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,107
工作怎么样啊?
How was work?

118
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:30,447
我有着近代欧洲史的博士学位...
I have a doctorate in modern European history...

119
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:35,807
却被派去监管那些留堂生
And yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention.

120
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:38,947
留堂生 嗯?
Detention, huh?

121
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,077
最糟的是
And the worst of it is,

122
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,097
当我看着那些派给我监管的
as I look out at those ingrates

123
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,427
混账学生时...
that I'm tasked with watching...

124
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,067
我不由自主地想...
I can't help thinking...

125
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:59,977
或许我还及不上他们中任何一个人
that maybe I'm more a loser than any of them.

126
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,497
我真不希望看到你过着这样的日子 Ben
This isn't the life I wanted for you, Ben.

127
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:08,907
我希望你能有更好的生活
I wanted so much more.

128
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,037
我知道
I know.

129
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:14,537
所以我才会去报名参加了那个该死的达摩组织
That's why I signed up for that damn Dharma Initiative

130
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,507
还带了你去那个岛 还...
and took you to the island, and...

131
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,357
他们都是些正直的人...
They were decent people...

132
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,477
都比我聪明
Smarter than I'll ever be.

133
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,277
想想如果我们留下来的话
Imagine how different our lives would've been

134
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,347
生活会有多么不同
if we'd stayed.

135
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,707
没错 我们会一直幸福地生活下去
Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after.

136
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,367
不 我是说真的 Ben
No, I'm serious, Ben.

137
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,227
天晓得你会变成什么样
Who knows what you would've become.

138
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,527
现在感觉好点了吗?
Now does that feel better?

139
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,927
是的
Yes.

140
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,237
谢谢
Thank you.

141
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,900
是Alex?
Alex?

142
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,990
Linus博士
Dr. Linus.

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,720
今天您去哪儿了? 我们迫不得已 取消了历史社团的活动
Where were you today? We had to cancel history club.

144
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,740
哦 对不起

286
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,480
不会 言出必行

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,150
你还想要吗?
Do you still want it?

299
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,020
你准备做什么?
What are you gonna do?

300
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,370
你要在我的香蕉叶上开支票?
You're gonna write me a check on this banana leaf?

301
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,480
我要离开这座岛 当我离开后
I can get off this island, and when I do,

302
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,080
我关系网和人脉很广
I have a vast network of people and resources

303
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,810
那时候就能把那笔钱给你
that will get you that money.

304
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,610
你要做的 就是放了我
All you have to do is cut me loose.

305
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,220
有价值八百万的钻石
Why would I need your money when there are

306
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,350
跟那两个叫Nikki和Paulo的家伙 一起埋在这儿
a couple of jabonies under there named Nikki and Paulo

307
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,340
我为什么还要你的钱?
who got buried alive with $8 million in diamonds on top of them?

308
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,760
简直不敢相信
I can't believe you're just gonna stand by

309
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,880
你居然袖手旁观
and watch this happen.

310
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,553
Ilana要杀了我...
Ilana's gonna murder me for killing Jacob...

311
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,823
就因为我杀了一个不在乎生死的Jacob
a man who didn't even care about being killed.

312
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,293
不 他在乎
No, he cared.

313
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,623
- 你说什么?  - 就在你的刀
- Excuse me?  - Right up until

314
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:22,763
要插入他心脏的那一秒
the second the knife went through his heart,

315
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,983
他希望这一切都是误会
he was hoping he was wrong about you.

316
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:28,353
我觉得他不想死
I guess he wasn't.

317
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:36,818
继续挖!
Dig!

318
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,338
所以... 你没穿越时空?
So... you're not time traveling?

319
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,098
没有
No.

320
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,798
但你看起来跟30年前一样
But you look the same as you did 30 years ago.

321
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:58,168
- 这怎么可能?  - 说来话长
- How is that possible?  - Not easy to explain.

322
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,048
就像"终结者"似的?
Is this like a "terminator" thing?

323
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:01,428
你是个生化人?
You a cyborg?

324
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:02,948
不 我不是生化人
No, I'm not a cyborg.

325
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:06,048
- 吸血鬼?  - 是Jacob赋予我的能力
- Vampire?  - Jacob gave me a gift.

326
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:09,158
是Jacob啊 你知道他的事吗?
Jacob. What do you know about him?

327
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,308
我知道他死了
I know he's dead.

328
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,680
哥们儿 你之前说去寺庙啊
I thought you said we were going to the temple, dude.

329
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,630
我撒谎了
I lied.

330
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
- 为什么?  - 因为寺庙里的每一个人都死了
- Why?  - Because everyone at the temple is dead.

331
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:36,227
什么叫他们都死了?
What do you mean, they're all dead?

332
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,187
发生什么事了?
What happened?

333
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,087
我... 我不清楚发生了什么
I'm... I'm not sure what happened,

334
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,427
但... 我刚打那儿来
but... I just came from there,

335
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,197
那儿没有生还者
and there's no survivors.

336
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:48,317
我们的朋友呢? Sayid和Kate
What about our friends? Sayid, Kate.

337
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,847
他们... 他们不在那儿
They... they weren't there.

338
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:52,427
他们可能逃过了一劫
Maybe they made it out alive.

339
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,297
我只知道 不管你想在寺庙找什么...
All I know is whatever you're looking for at the temple...

340
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,177
那儿没有
it's not there.

341
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,867
你不想回那里去 原来你知道这件事?
You didn't want to go back there. Did you know about this?

342
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,897
Jacob曾暗示过
Jacob kinda sorta hinted at it.

343
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,127
你跟Jacob说过话?
You spoke to Jacob?

344
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:07,457
对啊
Yeah.

345
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,307
好吧 无论他说什么 别相信他
Well, whatever he said, don't believe him.

346
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:17,907
- 你去哪儿?  - 我有事情要做
- Where you going?  - There's something I need to do.

347
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:19,087
去干嘛?
To do what?

348
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:21,387
去死
Die.

349
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:33,927
嘿 有时间吗?
Hey, do you have a minute?

350
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:37,807
我想有吧 也许我可以全给他们不及格
Yes, I guess. Might as well just give 'em all F's.

351
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:38,957
告诉我 动物的属和种
Tell me, how hard is it

352
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,647
有那么难区分吗?
to learn the difference between a genus and a species?

353
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,157
你想干嘛?
What do you want?

354
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,660
你玩电脑很在行 是吗?
You're pretty good with computers, aren't you?

355
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,970
如果你不知道
Something tells me you wouldn't even be standing here

356
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,560
你就不会平白无故地站在这里问我
if you didn't already know that I was.

357
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,840
假设 你能
Could you, hypothetically,

358
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,700
偷偷地打开别人的邮箱吗?
access someone's E-mail account without their knowledge?

359
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,860
我... 可以 看是什么样的邮箱
I... yeah, it depends on the account.

360
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,560
员工邮箱
Say a faculty account.

361
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,400
假设是
Hypothetically.

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,040
- 谁的?  - Kondracki护士的
- Whose?  - Nurse Kondracki.

363
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,210
Kim吗? 为什么? 你觉得她很辣?
Kim? Why? Do you got the hots for her?

364
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,720
不 我只是...
No. I'm just...

365
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,490
我只是对她的信件好奇
I'm curious about some of her correspondence.

366
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:17,705
跟谁的信?
With whom?

367
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,385
好吧 算了
Okay. That's fine.

368
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,805
我没找你 是你找上的我
I didn't come to see you. You came to see me.

369
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,015
我没时间回答你的问题
I don't have time to play 20 questions.

370
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,935
你要不就告诉我 你在做什么
Now you can either tell me what it is that you're doing,

371
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:34,115
- 要不就让我安安静静地改作业  - 好吧 好吧
- or you can let me finish grading my papers in peace.  - All right, all right.

372
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,795
我有理由相信 她也许
I have reason to believe that she might be engaged

373
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:41,205
跟Reynolds校长有
in an inappropriate personal relationship

374
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:42,625
不正当的关系
with Principal Reynolds.

375
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:45,885
你有预谋的
You're making a play.

376
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:49,105
你在预谋件大事 对吗?
You're going after the big job, aren't you?

377
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,525
Leslie 你要不要帮我?
Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?

378
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,285
我想要个好位子
I want a good spot.

379
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,465
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

380
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:00,475
我想要Lamr在主停车场的停车位...
I want Lamr's spot in the main parking lot...

381
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,525
在枫树旁边的那个
the one next to the maple tree.

382
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,305
不是在枫树下边的... 是在旁边的那个
Not under the maple tree... next to the maple tree.

383
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,695
这样的话 我的车会在树荫底下
That way, I get the shade from the maple tree

384
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,965
但那些树渣子又不会掉到我车上
but not all that tree crap all over the hood of my car.

385
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,070
我还想要实验服 很多实验服
And I want aprons. I want lots of aprons.

386
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,510
我还想要一些
And I want some lab equipment in here

387
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,500
- 近十年的实验器材 成交吗?  - 成交
- that was built in this decade. Is that a deal?  - Deal.

388
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,440
你知道 你真的能让我解决那个混蛋
You know, you really had me fooled with that sweater vest.

389
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,760
Linus 你才是真正的杀手
Linus, you're a real killer.

390
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,314
之前来过这儿?
Been here before?

391
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:23,794
是的
Yes.

392
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:29,674
我在岛上这么久
And in all the time that I've spent on this island,

393
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:32,194
今天是第一次回来这里
today is the first time I've ever come back.

394
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:35,574
Jack? 哥们儿 你在哪儿?
Jack? Dude, where are ya?

395
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,704
我在这儿
I'm in here.

396
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,780
别打开 那是甘油炸药
Do not open that. There's dynamite in there.

397
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,230
- 那个极不稳定  - 我知道
- It's mega-unstable.  - I know.

398
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,330
Arzt博士就是这样...
So did Dr. Arzt...

399
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,740
两天后 我才把粉身碎骨的他 从我的衣服里清干净
Then I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later.

400
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,110
- 哥们儿 该走了  - 不 还没到时候
- Dude, it's time to go.  - No, not yet.

401
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,350
他想打开那根甘油炸药
He's opening up a crate of dynamite,

402
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,330
- 他还说过要自杀  - 我自杀不了
- and he said he wanted to kill himself.  - I can't kill myself.

403
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:13,960
什么?
What?

404
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,080
即便我想死... 相信我 我是认真的...
Even if I wanted to... and trust me, I do...

405
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,770
我... 我没有办法自杀
I... I can't kill myself.

406
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,680
这也就是为什么 我要让你们替我下手
Which is why I want you to do it for me.

407
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,210
你到底在说些什么?
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,080
我所说的是 Jack 就是...
What I'm talking about, Jack, is that...

409
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,740
好吧 Jacob碰过我
Well, Jacob touched me.

410
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,040
当Jacob碰了你... 呃 这就算是大礼了吧
And when Jacob touches you... well, it's considered a gift.

411
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,670
除非它根本不是
Except it's not a gift at all.

412
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,390
这是一个诅咒
It's a curse.

413
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,000
伙计!
Dude!

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,540
我说认真的 咱们现在该走了!
Seriously, let's go now!

415
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,870
为什么你想死?
Why do you want to die?

416
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,300
我将我...
I devoted my life...

417
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,250
长到你无法想象的生命...
longer than you can possibly imagine...

418
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,960
奉献给 那个告诉我
in service of a man who told me

419
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,790
无风不起浪的人
that everything was happening for a reason,

420
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,481
他说他有一个计划...
that he had a plan...

421
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,761
我也是计划当中的一部分...
A plan that I was a part of...

422
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,001
当时机成熟的时候 他就会告诉我前因后果
And when the time was right that he'd share it with me.

423
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,041
但是现在 那个人死了
And now that man's gone.

424
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,551
所以我为何想死?
So why do I want to die?

425
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,621
因为我发现 我已经失去生活的目标了
Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose.

426
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,761
哪怕我能亲手点燃这个炸药 它... 也不会炸的
Now if I light this myself, it... it won't work.

427
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,641
但是你能帮我点燃 Jack
But you can light it for me, Jack.

428
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:19,741
我会把导火线做得足够长 这样你就有时间跑出去
I made the fuse long enough so you'll have time to get out.

429
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:23,651
Jack 求你告诉我 你不想这么做
Jack, please tell me you're not actually considering this.

430
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:25,741
如果他执意去死
If he wants to die,

431
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:27,311
我们无论如何也阻止不了
there's nothing we're gonna do to stop him.

432
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:35,351
谢谢你
Thank you.

433
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:02,741
现在...
Now...

434
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:06,241
我们谈谈吧
Let's talk.

435
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,190
Jack! 伙计 我们得走了 他疯了 我知道他疯了
Jack! Dude, we gotta go. Guy's crazy, and I know crazy.

436
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,530
- Hurley 你走吧 我们不会有事的  - 兄弟 你马上会被炸死的!
- Hurley, go ahead. We'll be all right.  - Dude, you're gonna blow up!

437
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,650
- 我得和他谈谈 Hurley 你走吧  - 不 我不会丢下你不管的
- Gotta talk to him, Hurley. Just go.  - No, I'm not going without you.

438
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,890
Hurley 我不会有事的
Hurley, I'll be fine.

439
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,742
如果你改变主意的话 我会在 大概 一里外的地方等你
If you change your mind, I'll be, like, a mile away.

440
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,972
- 你应该和他走的 Jack  - 不 Richard 不 我不会走的
- You should go with him, Jack.  - No, Richard. No, I shouldn't.

441
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,062
不然你会死的
Then you're gonna die.

442
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:43,532
事实上 我觉得我俩都死不了
Actually, I don't think either one of us is gonna die.

443
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,642
你为何这么想?
What makes you think that?

444
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:47,362
我刚从灯塔来
I just came from a lighthouse

445
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,312
转盘上刻着我的名字
where my name was etched in wood

446
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:52,292
使得镜子
on a dial that turned a mirror

447
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,602
可以照出我从小到大住的 那栋房子的景象
that somehow reflected the image of the house that I grew up in.

448
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,322
Jacob的灯塔
Jacob's lighthouse.

449
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:03,942
他叫Hurley把我从这弄出去
He got Hurley to bring me out there

450
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:06,482
因为他想让我看见镜子里所反射的景象
because he wanted me to see what was reflected in that mirror.

451
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:08,432
基于某个原因 他想让我知道
For some reason, he wanted me to know

452
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:11,322
当我还是个孩子的时候 他就开始注视我了
that he had been watching me ever since I was a kid.

453
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:14,522
为什么?
Why?

454
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:16,882
我不知道为什么
I have no idea why.

455
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:21,422
但是我敢向你打赌 如果Jacob费了这么大力气
But I'm willing to bet you that if Jacob went to that trouble,

456
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,932
基于某个原因把我弄到岛上来
that he brought me to this island for a reason,

457
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,792
肯定不会让我跟你现在一起被炸死
and it's not to blow up sitting here with you right now.

458
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,392
- 你在拿自己的命开玩笑啊 Jack  - 是的
- That's a pretty big risk you're taking, Jack.  - Yes.

459
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:36,442
- 但如果你错了怎么办?  - 我不会错的
- What if you're wrong?  - I'm not.

460
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,440
想再试一根吗?
Want to try another stick?

461
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,280
好吧 Jack
All right, Jack.

462
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,030
你好像看破一切玄机了 那么... 现在该怎么办?
You seem to have all the answers. So... so now what?

463
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,610
我们重回起点吧
We go back to where we started.

464
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,460
你好 Ben
Hello, Ben.

465
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,520
你在这儿做什么呢?
What are you doing here?

466
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,270
参观啊 你又在干什么呢?
Visiting. What are you doing?

467
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,220
我在自掘坟墓
I'm digging my own grave.

468
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,260
为什么?
Why?

469
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,630
因为你骗我杀了Jacob
Because you talked me into killing Jacob.

470
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,320
你看见那边吃芒果的那个女人了吗?
Do you see that woman over there eating a mango?

471
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,100
她是他的保镖 她知道我做了什么
She's his bodyguard, and she knows what I did.

472
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,360
你得偿所愿了 因为她要杀我
So you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me.

473
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,430
我可不想要你死 Ben
I don't want you to die, Ben.

474
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,270
其实 我是回雕塑这儿来找你的
In fact, I went back to the statue to get you,

475
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,840
- 但是你已经走了  - 找我? 为了什么?
- but you'd already gone.  - Get me? For what?

476
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,020
我正在召集一组人离开这里
I'm gathering a group to leave this place for good.

477
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,780
但是一旦我们走了
But once we're gone,

478
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,960
岛还需要人来接管
someone's gonna need to be in charge of the island.

479
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,220
我?
Me?

480
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,990
我实在找不出比你更合适的人选
I can't think of a better man for the job.

481
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,530
哦 在这种情况下 可能性看上去不大吧
Well, it doesn't seem very likely, does it,

482
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,340
对不?
under the circumstances?

483
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
我怎么样才能离开...
How am I gonna get away from...

484
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,790
去另一个岛 去九头蛇站
Come to the other island, to the Hydra Station.

485
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,380
- 那就是我们要去的地方  - 她会跟着我的
- That's where we'll be.  - She'll come after me.

486
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,680
往里走200码的地方 林中空地有一棵树
200 yards inland, there's a tree in the clearing

487
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,240
树上架了把来福枪
with a rifle leaning up against it.

488
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,230
如果现在走的话 你能第一个到那儿
If you go now, you'll get there first

489
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,280
然后你就可以干掉她
and you'll have the drop on her.

490
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,350
但是千万别犹豫
But don't hesitate.

491
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,820
她可不会
She won't.

492
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,530
待会见 Ben
See you soon, Ben.

493
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,900
嘿!
Hey!

494
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,100

Reynolds校长室

495
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,240
进来
Come in.

496
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,030
Linus 我现在没有时间
Linus, I don't have time

497
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,130
听你抱怨那些留堂生的事
to listen to you complain about detention.

498
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,300
我不是为这个来的 我想让你看些东西
That's not why I'm here. I want you to read something.

499
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,350
好吧 如果你想让你那个小社团...
Well, if this some attempt to revive your little club...

500
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,890
这些是3个月内的30封邮件
Those are 30 E-mails that cover a 3-month period.

501
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,220
这事还真淫乱
It's pretty lascivious stuff,

502
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,650
如果是私房事 也就罢了
which would be fine if it was private,

503
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,850
但是它们好像描述的是
but they seem to describe

504
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,840
发生在校园的行为...
acts that took place on school property...

505
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,070
不知廉耻的行为
acts which, morality aside,

506
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,470
我想学校董事会一定会不满
I think the school board would frown on,

507
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,060
更别说你的妻子
not to mention your wife.

508
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,740
你想要什么?
What do you want?

509
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,820
你的职位
Your job.

510
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,640
你要辞职...
You're gonna resign...

511
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,300
原因是 比如...
for, I don't know...

512
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,010
一些个人理由 健康问题之类 随便你掰
personal reasons, health. Your call.

513
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,230
在你辞职的同时 你要向校董事会
But with your resignation, you're gonna recommend

514
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,670
推荐我来接替你的职位
that the school board hire me as your replacement.

515
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,850
讽刺的是
And the irony of all this

516
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,010
他们会因为对你的尊敬
is that they hold you in such esteem

517
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,500
而让我真的坐上这个位子
that I'll get the job.

518
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,610
那... 我们达成共识了吗?
So... do we have an understanding?

519
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,100
Linus啊...
Linus...

520
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,900
我能给你读一封电子邮件吗?
May I read you an E-mail?

521
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,680
"亲爱的Reynolds校长"
"Dear Principal Reynolds,

522
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,200
"如果您能为我向耶鲁大学写
"I would appreciate it if you could write

523
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,400
"一封推荐信 我将感激涕零
"a letter of recommendation to Yale on my behalf.

524
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,020
"这对我很重要
"It would mean the world to me.

525
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,340
致礼 Alexandra Rousseau"
Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau."

526
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:34,705
推荐信这种事真有趣 Linus
It's a funny thing about recommendations, Linus.

527
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:37,075
它们承载着2个人的希望
They work both ways.

528
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,075
所以...
So...

529
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:41,915
我把这个难题抛给你
I put the ball back in your court.

530
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:47,045
你可以施展你的小手段
You can execute your little machiavellian maneuvers,

531
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:49,795
争取我的工作 坐我的办公桌
go for my job, sit at my desk.

532
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,575
但是 唉 不幸的副作用...
But, alas, there will be an unfortunate side effect...

533
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,825
我能给Rousseau小姐
I will torch Miss Rousseau

534
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,515
灿烂的前程
and her future.

535
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:04,545
我的职位和权力 对你这么重要吗?
Is my job, my power, that important to you?

536
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,455
那么...
So...

537
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,755
你的抉择是什么 Linus博士?
What'll it be, Dr. Linus?

538
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:33,295
放下!
Drop it!

539
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:34,805
把枪放下!
Put the gun down!

540
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,680
你还等什么?
What are you waiting for?

541
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,070
我想要解释
I want to explain.

542
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,200
解释什么?
Explain what?

543
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,390
我想要解释 我知道你的感受
I want to explain that I know what you're feeling.

544
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,110
你不知道我的感受
You have no idea what I'm feeling.

545
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,820
我看着我的女儿Alex 死在我面前
I watched my daughter Alex die in front of me.

546
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,250
而且是我造成的
And it was my fault.

547
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,230
我有机会救她的
I had a chance to save her,

548
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,590
但是我选择了小岛...
but I chose the island...

549
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,400
而不是她
over her.

550
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,240
都是为了Jacob
All in the name of Jacob.

551
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,100
我为他牺牲了一切...
I sacrificed everything for him...

552
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,560
他甚至都不在乎
and he didn't even care.

553
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,200
是 我捅死了他
Yeah, I stabbed him.

554
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,470
我... 很生气...
I was... so angry..

555
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,100
昏了头
confused.

556
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,080
我... 我担心失去
I... I was terrified that I was about to lose

557
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,540
对我唯一重要的东西...
the only thing that had ever mattered to me...

558
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,240
权力
My power.

559
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,190
但是真正重要的东西...
But the thing that really mattered...

560
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,350
已经没了
was already gone.

561
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,130
很抱歉我杀了Jacob
I'm sorry that I killed Jacob.

562
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,460
真的
I am.

563
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,330
但是我也不指望你原谅我
And I do not expect you to forgive me

564
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,560
因为...
Because...

565
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,199
我不能原谅自己
I can never forgive myself.

566
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:24,769
那么你想要什么?
Then what do you want?

567
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:29,289
只要... 放我走
Just... let me leave.

568
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,409
你要去哪?
Where will you go?

569
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:37,579
去找Locke
To Locke.

570
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:39,969
为什么?
Why?

571
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,679
因为只有他能收留我
Because he's the only one that'll have me.

572
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,019
我会收留你
I'll have you.

573
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:27,239

Donald Lawrence Reynolds校长

574
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:39,496
Linus博士
Dr. Linus.

575
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:43,396
- 您好啊 Alex  - 我顺路来感谢Reynolds校长
- Hello, Alex.  - I was just coming by to thank Principal Reynolds.

576
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:46,276
他给我写了一封不可思议的推荐信
He wrote me the most incredible letter of recommendation.

577
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:47,766
哇 太好了
Wow. Wonderful.

578
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,576
是您起了作用吗?
Did you have something to do with it?

579
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,916
我是说 我原本以为他可能会说些好话
I mean, I thought he might say some nice things,

580
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:56,956
- 但是他好话都说绝了 - 不 跟我没关系 Alex
- but he really went all out.  - No, it wasn't me, Alex.

581
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:58,496
但是大家都说 你是个优秀的学生
But it always say you're a great student.

582
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,716
很明显 不只有我能看到
Obviously, I wasn't the only one who noticed.

583
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:02,007
谢谢你 博士...
Thanks, doctor...

584
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:04,487
Linus 你他妈的在我办公室里干啥呢?
Linus, what the hell are you doing in my office?

585
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:08,737
应你的要求 来送这周留堂生的
Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week,

586
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:10,467
登记表
per your request.

587
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:12,647
放我桌上就行
Just put it on my desk.

588
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,207
那么我们历史社团见?
So will I see you at history club?

589
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:20,707
- 啊 您是说何时重新搞活动吗?  - 哦 不 我们按原计划进行
- Uh, you mean when it's back on?  - Oh, no, we've got our old slot back.

590
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:22,907
Reynolds校长找了别人监管留堂生
Principal Reynolds found someone to cover for detention.

591
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:24,207
是不是?
Isn't that right?

592
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,510
是 没错
Yes, that's right.

593
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,010
哦 好吧 下午4点见
Well, then, see you at 4:00.
