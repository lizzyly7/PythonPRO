00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
剧情回顾...
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,024
是他们  其他人...
It was them. The Others...

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,004
你在这座岛上看见过其他人吗?
Have you seen other people on this island?

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,027
我能听到他们
I hear them.

5
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:10,049
他们就在丛林里
Out there, in the jungle.

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,063
他们在悄悄说话
They whisper.

7
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,084
他们袭击了我们
They've attacked us,

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,006
破坏我们  还绑架我们的人
sabotaged us, abducted us!

9
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:26,007
我们不是这岛上唯一的一群人 这我们大家都知道
We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it!

10
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,082
也许现在我们应该停止互相责备
Maybe it's time we stopped blaming us

11
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:28,087
开始考虑一下他们了
and started worrying about them!

12
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:31,075
他们第一晚来  带走了我们三个人
They came the first night, took three of us,

13
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:35,091
后来他们又回来带走了另外九个人
then they came back and took nine more.

14
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,089
他们很聪明  而且像野兽一般
They're smart, and they're animals,

15
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,010
他们可以在任何时候出现在任何地方
and they could be anywhere at anytime,

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,013
如果你以为一把枪和一颗子弹
and if you think that one gun and one bullet

17
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:46,093
就可以阻止他们...
is gonna stop them...

18
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:49,056
再想想吧
think again

19
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:54,060
Shannon

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,033
这不是你们的岛
This is not your island.

21
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,077
这是我们的岛
This is our island,

22
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:08,036
你们之所以能生活在这里
and the only reason you're livin' on it

23
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:11,071
是因为我们允许你们这么做
is 'cause we let you live on it.

24
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:19,027
他们离这越来越近了  赶快撤
They're getting closer! Move it!

25
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,078
把它们烧了
Burn those!

26
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,074
再碎得快点
Shred faster!

27
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:28,005
快
Hurry up!

28
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,064
Sayid  把这些文件拿走
Sayid! Take these files!

29
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,079
烧了它们
Burn them!

30
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,082
你们这些孬种  继续碎文件
Keep shredding you cowards!

31
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,098
等我说了才能离开
We leave when I say!

32
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:46,074
再停下来  我就亲自杀了你
Stop again,and I'll kill you myself!

33
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,009
我是你的上级  你应该照着我的话...
I'm your commanding,officer, and you will do...

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,028
停下  趴下  快给我趴下  趴下  趴下
Stop! Get down!Get the hell down! Get down, get down!

35
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,088
你  不  不  不  赶紧把枪扔在地上
You, no, no, no, drop your gun on the ground now!

36
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,039
别动  趴在地上
Freeze! On the ground now!

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,018
不要再烧了  给我趴下
Stop burning that stuff! Get the hell down!

38
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,040
这儿谁指挥?
Who's in charge here?

39
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:09,025
我说这儿谁指挥?
I said who's in charge?!

40
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,009
最好有人告诉他停下  不然他就死定了
Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he's dead!

41
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,027
他们听不懂  中士
They don't understand, Sergeant.

42
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:16,032
他们听的懂  听着
They understand. Listen up.

43
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:17,099
数三下我就开枪
I'll fire on three.

44
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,019
一  二...
One, two...

45
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,051
快别再碎文件了  不然他会杀了你

46
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,003
你
You.

47
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:29,067
你是头儿?
You in charge?

48
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,043
不  我不是
No, I am not.

49
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:33,095
谁是?
Who is?

50
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,088
我们这没有指挥官
There is no commanding officer here.

51
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:42,002
他两个小时前去了希拉
He left two hours ago for Hillah.

52
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,020
你的英语说得不错  阿拉伯人
Your English is good, Abdul.

53
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,017
但是你在撒谎
But you're lying.

54
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:48,054
这可不好
And that ain't so good.

55
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,048
就是他  中士
That's him, Sergeant.

56
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:08,063
我们走  伙计
Let's go, hombre.

57
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,033
小子  我们和你一样也不想待在这儿
Son, we don't wanna be here any more than you do,

58
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:20,018
但是你们的兄弟萨达姆打到了科威特
but your pal Saddam had to go marching into Kuwait.

59
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,087
所以我们来了
Here we all are.

60
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,087
听Buccelli说你会说英语
Buccelli here says you speak English.

61
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,041
你做过翻译么?
You ever do any translating?

00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,026
正式的?  没有
Formally, no.

63
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:30,069
靠
Hell.

64
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,027
你还知道"正式的"是什么意思
Fact that you know what "formally" means...

65
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,087
那就没问题了
We're good.

66
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:40,011
两天前我们有一架阿帕奇直升机 在这个地区坠毁了
Apache helicopter went down in this sector two days ago.

67
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,000
我们的情报显示飞行员被抓了
Our sources tell us the pilot was captured.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,059
救回这个飞行员对于我们来说很重要
It's very important that we get this pilot back.

69
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,096
我们知道他被带到了当地的 共和国卫队情报首长那里...
He was taken to the Republican Guard intelligence commander,

70
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,086
一个叫Tariq的人

74
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,065
轰炸开始的时候
When the bombing started,

75
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,038
他就逃到了希拉
he fled to Hillah.

76
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,052
希拉  是么?
Hillah, huh?

77
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:10,047
对  没错
Yes, that is right.

78
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,095
那就欢迎来到希拉
Welcome to Hillah.

79
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,046

00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,062
什么?
What?

85
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,019
回去  Ana Lucia
Go back, Ana Lucia.

86
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,063
别告诉任何人你看到了什么
And don't tell anyone what you saw.

87
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,032
你在这儿干什么  Danielle?
What are you doing here, Danielle?

88
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,038

你说你在找我
You said you were looking for me.

93
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,099
你是怎么想的...
What was your plan?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,037
躲在树丛里
To hide in the woods,

95
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,058
希望我会路过?
hoping I would pass you by?

96
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,036
我想等天黑了
I was going to wait until dark,

97
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,083
再去你的帐篷找你
and then find you at your tent.

98
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,001
为什么?
Why?

99
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,052
我们得一直走
We need to keep moving.

100
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:21,018
除非你先告诉我去哪儿

00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,069
相信我
Trust me.

102
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,043
我们上一次见面的时候
The last time we met,

103
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:27,047
你警告我们其他人要来了
you warned us the Others were coming,

104
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,094
结果他们没来
which they weren't.

105
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:32,021
实际上  你是为了引开我们的注意力 好掳走Claire的孩子
In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire's baby.

106
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:35,033
所以很抱歉  我不能相信你
So pardon me for not trusting you.

107
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:39,042
我带你去的地方...
This place I am taking you to,

108
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:42,009
那里有东西可以帮助你

所以相信我
As for trust,

111

112
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,090
如果我骗你 你就开枪好了
If I'm lying, it's yours to use.

113
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,005
还有多远?
How much further?

114
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:17,028
不远了
Not far.

115
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:21,044
问他飞行员被带到哪里去了
Ask him where he took the pilot.

116
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,008
他们想知道飞行员在哪里

117
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:33,033
告诉他他妈是色鬼

118
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,083
他说他不知道
He says he does not know.

119
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:39,011
听着  我们知道他前天 审问了那个飞行员...
We know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday.

120
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,011
而且可能就是在这个房间
Hell, probably in this room.

121
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,065
告诉他
Tell him,

122
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:49,069
只要我们的人完好无损的回来 他就自由了
we get our man back safe and sound,he goes free.

123
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,065
如果你告诉他们飞行员在哪里 他们就让你走

124
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:01,003
你真是无耻

125
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,045
你是个伊拉克士兵

126
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:06,040
偷走他的枪  把他们都杀了

127
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,048
枪就在他的皮带上

128
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:15,065
你死前至少可以杀掉他们好几个

129
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,019
他在说什么?
What's he saying?

130
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:21,051
他说他不知道
He says he does not know.

131
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:26,033
我可不是一岁的小孩了
I was born,but I wasn't born yesterday, son.

132
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:29,050
你不肯帮忙  自然有别人会来接替
You don't help me out here,someone else will take over,

133
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,012
而那个人
and that someone,

134
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,055
他才不会心软呢
he won't play nice at all.

135
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,074
对不起
I am sorry.

136
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:42,038
他不知道
He does not know.

137
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:47,074
好吧  你是有过机会的
OK. You had your chance.

138
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,001
卫兵
Guards.

139
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:54,019
把他关起来
Lock him back up.

140
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:17,044
真不可思议
This is unbelievable.

141
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,008
嘿  嘿  你听见没有?
Hey. Hey, you hear that thing?

142
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,034
你听见那只青蛙了吗?
You hear that frog?

143
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,085
青蛙?
Frog?

144
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,093
帮我一起去找找看?
You wanna help me find it?

145
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:40,057
怎么着  我们不再是朋友了?
What? We ain't friends anymore?

146
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,003
你在干什么?
What you got there, Rerun?

147
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,026
没什么
Nothing.

148
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:19,036
没错  不过你的脸上还有一块叫 "没什么"的东西
Yeah, well, you got a spot of nothing on your chin there.

149
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:26,062
"达摩启动计划奶油色拉酱"
Dharma Initiative Ranch Dressing?

150
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:30,042
你知道  打开它后应该把它放冰箱里
You're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it.

151
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,030
事实上  这背面写着
Actually, on the back it says

152
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,037
它可以在室温下保存七年
it'll keep at room temperature for up to seven years.

153
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,047
哟  看看是谁的私人储藏室
Well, well.Looky who's got a secret stash.

154
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,014
别  伙计  你可不能说
Please, dude. You can't tell.

155
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:48,066
什么  不说你从大伙那偷东西吃?
What? That you stole food from the group?

156
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,031
我为什么不说呢?
Now, why would I wanna do that?

157
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:55,000
嗨  伙计  拜托了好不好?

你会杀了他

如果我想杀他  他早就死了

你无缘无故射了这个人

202
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:28,073
他是他们中的一个

203
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:31,053
把他绑起来
Tie him up.

204
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,005
你应该带他去见你们的医生
You should take him to your doctor.

205
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,076
他死了就没用了
He's no good to you dead.

206
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:37,054
然后怎么样呢?
And then what?

207
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,051
你问他话  Sayid
You'll talk to him, Sayid.

208
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,031
没记错的话
As I recall,

209
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,092
这是你的老本行
that is what you do.

210
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,042
但是记住...

211
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,068

很长一段时间

213

他会不停说慌

214

我想和你谈谈你的朋友
I wanna talk to you about your buddy,

215
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:40,044
Tariq

216
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:43,084
好吧  我了解
Ah, look, I get it.

217
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:46,075
你是个忠诚的人
You're a man who values loyalty.

218
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:51,045
甚至为我们做翻译都觉得 好像在做什么错事
Even doing a little translating for us,you feel like you're doing the wrong thing.

219
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:53,025
我了解
I get that,

220
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,013
也尊重你
and I respect it.

221
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:05,006
这是Tariq在掌管你的情报部门前 所作的事情
This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit.

222
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:09,007
他曾经是北方一支化学战队的指挥官
He was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north.

223
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:13,098
曾亲自监督了这个村庄里 沙林毒气的使用
Personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village.

224
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:24,015
你认识这个村子  对吧?
You recognize it, don't you?

225
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:28,094
你在那个村子有亲戚  对吧  Sayid?
You had relatives in that village didn't you, Sayid?

226
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:36,006
你知道沙林毒气能造成什么后果
So, you know what sarin gas does.

227
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,073
无论男女老少
No discrimination.

228
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,085
整个集市
The entire marketplace.

229
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,098
无辜的妇女...
Innocent women,

230
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,072
孩子
children.

231
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:53,046
够了...
Enough.

232
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:56,016
拜托
Please.

233
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:03,048
忠诚是美德
Loyalty is a virtue.

234
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,059
但是无条件的忠诚...
But unquestioning loyalty...

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,005
我觉得你不会是这样的
I don't think that's you.

236
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,035
我为什么要相信你?
Why should I believe you?

237
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:18,045
你觉得我们怎么知道 你在那个村子有亲戚的?
How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village?

238
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:23,072
我们获得了你和Tariq的个人档案
We liberated your personnel file and Tariq's.

239
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:30,061
我们只想救回我们的飞行员
All we want is our pilot back,

240
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:34,001
然后把他送回家跟家人团聚
so we can send him home to his family.

241
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,025
Tariq不会告诉你们的
Tariq will never talk to you.

242
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:44,097
这就是为什么你必须要让他告诉你
That's why you're gonna have to make him talk to you.

243
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,098
John  John  醒醒
John. John, wake up.

244
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,039
怎么了?
What?

245

出来一下
Come out here.

246
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:16,007
明尼苏达  是么?
Minnesota, huh?

247
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:20,032
很可疑  不是么?
That's the question, isn't it?

248
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,017
这是...这是在哪儿?
Wh... Where am I?

249
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:30,014
你是谁?
Who are you?

250
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,031
Henry  Henry Gale

251
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:35,005
我的背
Ah, my back.

252
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,055
我们会把它取出来 但是首先你得放松
We're going to take it out,but first I want you to relax.

253
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,026
你怎么到这个岛上的?

254
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,079
四个月前
Four months ago.

255
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,078
我们掉到这个岛上  我妻子和我
We crashed, my wife and I.

256
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,021
什么坠毁了?
Crashed in what?

257
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,050
一个热气球
A balloon.

258
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:54,017
我们正尝试横穿太平洋
We were trying to cross the Pacific.

259
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:58,065
你的妻子...她在哪儿?
Your wife, where is she?

260
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,059
她死了
She died.

261
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,095
她...
She got...

262
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:07,089
三个星期前生了病
She got sick, three weeks ago.

263
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:13,048
我们呆在沙滩那边的一个洞穴里
We were staying in a cave off the beach.

264
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:16,058
我的肩膀
My shoulder.

265
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,096
至少给我的胳膊松绑
At least untie my arms.

266
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,075
这儿怎么了?
What the hell's going on here?

267
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,012
Rousseau把他困在了丛林里
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

268
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,013
她认为他是"其他人"
She believes he's an Other.

269
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,021
其他人?
Another what?

270
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,002
你用箭射他?
You shot him with an arrow?

271
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:35,050
我有弓吗?
Do I have a bow?

272
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:39,078
能听见我说么?
Hey, hey. You with me?

273
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,025
你准备让他流血至死?
You were gonna let him bleed to death?

274
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:45,031
我只是想趁着他还行的时候 从他嘴里得到真实可靠的回答
I was trying to get honest answers.

275
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:48,048
他的伤根本不致命
And his wound is far from life-threatening.

276
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,008
我们应该让Jack先治疗他  然后再问我们想知道的东西
We should let Jack treat him first.Then we'll get our answers.

277
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,002
Jack...

278
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:56,098
别把绳子松开
Do not untie him.

279
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,048
恐怖片里的人就是这么被弄死的
This is how people get killed in scary movies.

280
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:16,039
如果这是恐怖片  我应该是和一个 美女在一起  而不是你
If this were a scary movie, I'd be with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.

281
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,035
我怎么了
It's Babar.

282
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,005
你好闭嘴了
Why don't you shut up, Hammo?

283
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:26,051
不然你的色拉紊乱症立马成为椰子岛互联网上新的头条了
Or your Ranch disorder's gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet.

284
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:28,059
好吧
Fine.

285
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,085
随你便

286
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,049
告诉所有人那个胖子 一直在私藏奶油色拉酱

00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,074
胖  胖  胖  胖  胖
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.

290
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:43,047
你以为我不知道么?
You think I don't know that?

291
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:47,003
至少人们喜欢我
At least people like me.

292
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,002
你知道吗? 你自己去找那该死的青蛙吧
Well, find the damn frog by yourself.

293
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,059
Hurley  等等
Hurley, wait.

294
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,059
等等  嘿  Hurley
Wait. Hey, Hurley.

295
00:19:57,046 --> 00:20:01,016
听着  伙计  对不起  好了吧?
Look, man, I'm sorry. All right?

296
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,013
那个青蛙快要折磨死我了
But this frog is killing me.

297
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:05,037
你得帮帮我...
You gotta help me out.

298
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,012
求你了
Please.

299
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,050
你怎么看?
So, what do you think?

300
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,029
你怎么认为  John?
What do you think, John?

301
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:52,067
我觉得他很有说服力
I think he's pretty convincing.

302
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,019
没错
Yes, he is.

303
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,047
问题是我们没办法
The real problem is there's no way

304
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:02,089
确定他是在说实话
we can be sure he's telling the truth.

305
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:07,071
那可不一定
That is not necessarily true.

306
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:13,076
Jack是不是有武器库的密码?
Does Jack have the combination to the armory?

307
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,054
现在是这样
For now he does.

308
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:21,042
你改密码要花多长时间?
How long would it take for you to change it?

309
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,097
如果你很生气
If you're angry,

310
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:36,015
想找个人来出出气...
looking for someone to punish...

311
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:39,058
我为什么要找人出气?
Why would I need to punish anyone?

312
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,037
我想要知道他到底是谁
I want to find out who he is.

313
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,067
我想要知道真相
I want the truth.

314
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:56,092
我想我们都知道Jack肯定会采取一些措施
We both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done to get it.

315
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,030
所以要多久  John
So, how long, John,

316
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,016
能改掉密码?
to change the combination?

317
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:09,018
最多几分钟
Couple of minutes, tops.

318
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:12,092
那我建议你现在就开始
Then I suggest you get started.

319
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:29,059
-在你治疗的时候他有没有说...  -没有
-Did he say anything while...  -No, he didn't.

320
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:33,018
他休克了
He was in shock.

321
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,073
我们不能让他这么躺着  Jack
We can't just leave him laying here,Jack.

322
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:40,019
人们会看见他  接着恐慌就会开始了
People will see him.It'll create a panic.

323
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,030
是么?  那你觉得我们应该把他放哪?
Where do you think we should put him?

324
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,003
不如把他放在武器库里
I say we put him in the armory.

325
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,060
那里很安全
It's secure.

326
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,050
为了大家安全 就算犯个错也是值得的  Jack
Better to err on the side of safety,Jack,

327
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,088
至少等到我们确定他是好人
at least until we can be sure.

328
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,013
好吧
OK.

329
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:01,058
暂时先这样
For now.

330
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:30,076
好  把那个帆布床拖进来
We can pull that cot in here.

331
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,078
他背上有伤  不能直接这么躺着
He shouldn't be on his back.

332
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,033
好主意
Good idea.

333
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:45,058
Sayid

334
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:48,003
你到底是在干嘛?
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

335
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,032
Sayid

336
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:52,034
做应该做的
What needs to be done.

337
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,054
他们让你单独和我谈吗?
They're letting speak to me alone now?

338
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:13,095
你得告诉我那个飞行员在哪儿
You need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is.

339
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,041
这就是他们的新把戏?
This is their new bluff?

340
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:31,005
让你来拷问我?
That you're going to torture me?

341
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,064
他们觉得你会这么做?
They think you will do this?

342
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:42,052
Sayid  你是一名忠诚的士兵
Sayid, you are a loyal soldier.

343
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:43,098
一个伟大英雄的儿子
The son of a great hero.

344
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:47,073
别让你的父亲蒙羞
Do not disgrace your father!

345
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,004
你不敢碰我的
You wouldn't dare harm me!

346
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:56,046
你要听我的命令  我是指挥官
You will follow my orders as your commanding officer!

347
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:58,003
拿着那个袋子
Take that bag.

348
00:24:58,003 --> 00:25:00,047
罩在你的头上再用带子绑起来
Put it over your head and tape it up.

349
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:02,050
现在就杀了你自己
Kill yourself, now!

350
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,073
这是命令
That's an order.

351
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:08,059
照做  然后带着你仅剩的一点荣誉死去吧
Do it and die with what little honor you have left.

352
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:12,063
你让我自杀...
You would have me take my own life...

353
00:25:12,064 --> 00:25:16,043
这对你毫无意义
the information means nothing to you!

354
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,060
那个飞行员两天前就被处决了
The pilot was executed two days ago.

355
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:07,092
他被埋在四公里外的一块地里
He is buried in a field four kilometers from here.

356
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:10,091
我可以带你去那儿
I can take you there.

357
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:31,000
可恶
Damn it.

358
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,095
Sayid  开门
Sayid, open the door.

359
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:35,056
Sayid  回答我
Sayid, answer me.

360
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,058
Jack

361
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,090
这密码怎么不行  John?
Why isn't this combination working,John?

362
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,062
你改过了?
Did you change it?

363
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,094
是的
Yeah.

364
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,079
你为什么这么做?
Why would you do that?

365
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,065
你在组建军队
You're raising an army.

366
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,040
什么?
What?

367
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,049
你为什么没要我帮忙? 当然  这是你的事
Why you didn't ask me is your business.

368
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,035
但要组建军队只可能有一个理由  Jack
But there's only one reason to raise an army,

369
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,089
那就是因为我们面临战争
and that's because we're at war.

370
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,060
不管你喜不喜欢
And like it or not,

371
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Sayid在这门后做的任何事 也是这场战争的一部分
whatever Sayid has to do behind that door,that's a part of it, too.

372
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:13,084
如果他说的是实话呢  John?
What if he's telling the truth, John?

373
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:16,083
如果不是呢?
What if he's not?

374
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,051
起来
Get up.

375
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,076
发...发生了什么事?
What's happening?

376
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,094
来  让我帮你一把
Here. Let me help you.

377
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:48,031
你说你在这岛上已经四个月了
You said you've been here for four months.

378
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:52,037
你说你四个月前到的这个岛上  对吧?
You said you came to this island four months ago, yes?

379
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,096
我在哪?
Where am I?

380
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:57,030
我叫你
Please.

381
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,097
回答我的问题
Answer my question.

382
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:03,002
对...对  我们四个月前落在了岛上
Yeah, yes. We landed four months ago.

383
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,099
可能还不止四个月
Maybe more.

384
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,007
你一直呆在一个洞里?
You were in a cave for all that time?

385
00:28:08,008 --> 00:28:10,058
在沙滩那边...
Off the beach.

386
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,000
这个岛的北岸
On the north shore of the island.

387
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,021
从那片沙滩到你被抓住的地方有多远?
How far from where you were captured?

388
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:15,022
我不知道
I don't know.

389
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,052
-几天的路程?  -两...两天
-How many days walk?  -Two. Two days.

390
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:19,072
你们为什么要呆在沙滩上那么长时间?
Why did you stay on the beach so long?

391
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,038
为什么不呢?
Why wouldn't we?

392
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:25,044
我们希望能等到低空飞行的飞机
We wanted to be there for flyovers.

393
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:27,090
我们有一个信号发射器
We had an emergency beacon,a transmitter.

394
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,056
什么样的发射器?
What kind of transmitter?

395
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,047
一个标准式样的
An ADF beacon.

396
00:28:32,048 --> 00:28:35,080
我们想确定我们能被雷达发现
We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted.

397
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,039
听着
Look,

398
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,091
无论你认为我是谁  我不是
whatever you think I am, I'm not.

399
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:47,039
拜托  拜托...
Please, please,

400
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,017
你叫什么?
just tell me your name.

401
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,003
你妻子...她原来姓什么?
Your wife. What is her maiden name?

402
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:53,020
-Murphy  -你在哪儿认识她的?
-Murphy.  -Where did you meet her?

403
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,000
明尼苏达大学
University of Minnesota.

404
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,043
她是怎么死的?
How did she die?

405
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:59,076
她病死的
She got sick.

406
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,048
生病了?
She got sick?

407
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:06,084
一开始是发烧
It started as a fever.

408
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:10,050
两天后就神志不清...
After two days, she was delirious.

409
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:15,030
然后死了
Then she died.

410
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,039
我不知道你为什么问我这么多问题
I don't know why you're asking these questions.

411
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,058
我也不明白你为何这样对我...
I don't know why you're treating me this way,

412
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,003
为什么我必须向你解释我是谁
why I have to explain to you who I am

413
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:36,061
而你却不告诉我你是谁
when you don't tell me who you are.

414
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:41,056
我23岁时  美国人来到了我们国家
I was 23 years old when the Americans came to my country.

415
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:43,033
我是一个好人
I was a good man.

416
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,043
我是一个士兵...
I was a soldier.

417
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:49,016
那些美国人走了之后
And when they left,

418
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,090
我变得跟以前不同了
I was something different.

419
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:54,053
在之后的六年中
For the next six years

420
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:57,067
我做了许多难堪回首的事
I did things I wish I could erase from my memory,

421
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:01,074
我从来就没有想过可以做到的事...
things which I never thought myself to be capable of.

422
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:06,089
但是我却学会了...
But I did come to learn this.

423
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:11,079
我有这潜力
There is a part of me which was always capable.

424
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:16,009
你想知道我是谁?
You want to know who I am.

425
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:23,004
我叫Sayid Jarrah...
My name is Sayid Jarrah,

426
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:26,087
我是一个拷问官
and I am a torturer.

427
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,065
在哪儿啊?
Where is it?

428
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:44,016
在这里
There it is.

429
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:56,002
抓到了
Gotcha.

430
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:58,051
伙计  好身手
Dude, nice catch.

431
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:00,099
就算我该死
Well, I'll be damned.

432
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,051
这吵人的声音都是这家伙搞出来的
All that noise from this tiny critter.

433
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:07,043
它让我想起了以前我有过的一只乌龟
Kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had.

434
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:09,029
它叫Stewart
His name was Stewart.

435
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:12,022
当我十岁时它就跑掉了
He ran off when I was ten.

436
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:14,065
这些都是我妈妈说的
Well, that's what Mom said.

437
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:18,013
我有点觉得是妈妈把它扔掉的
I kind of think she threw him out.

438
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:25,033
呃  你是个快乐的小家伙  不是吗?
Wow, you're a happy little fellow,ain't you?

439
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:33,021
我有一个主意
I have an idea.

440
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:37,078
不如把它交给我吧
Why don't I take him far from here?

441
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,050
我把它带到两个海滩之外?
Two beaches away.

442
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,067
也许我会找到树蛙女士
Maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog.

443
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:47,013
这样它就不会叫了  大家都开心
That way he won't keep you up anymore and everyone's happy.

444
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:52,053
是啊  这是个办法
Yeah, that's one idea.

445
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:56,044
而这是另一个办法
Here's another.

446
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:01,017
伙计...
Dude.

447
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:06,051
我听说抹上一点色拉酱 它尝起来就像鸡肉
I hear with a little Ranch they taste just like chicken.

448
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:35,037
需要帮忙吗?
Give you a hand?

449
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:45,072
闭嘴
Shut up.

450
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:02,001
钳子到哪里去了?
Where are the pliers?

451
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:06,079
给我说说那个热气球
Tell me about this balloon.

452
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,004
什么?
What?

453
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:11,063
那个把你和你妻子带到这儿来的气球  跟我说说
This balloon that brought you here.Tell me about it.

454
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:14,018
你想知道什么?
What do you wanna know?

455
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,086
任何东西
Everything.

456
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:24,046
它高140英尺  宽60英尺...
She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide.

457
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:33,041
在空中时  55万立方的氦和 10万立方的热空气能让它保持飞行
And when she's up in the air,550,000 cubic feet of helium and 100,000 of hot air keep her up.

458
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:36,019
如果你在空中从上往下看它
And if you could look down on her,

459
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,043
你可以看见在顶端有个很大的黄色笑脸
you'd see a big yellow smiley face on top.

460
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:45,064
你们为什么以这样的方式旅行呢?
Why would you travel in that way?

461
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:50,031
因为我很富有...
Because I was rich.

462
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:54,054
而且它是我的梦想...
Because it was my dream.

463
00:33:56,052 --> 00:34:00,061
Jennifer也觉得这是很酷的事
And Jennifer thought it would be neat.

464
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:03,055
你很有钱?
You were rich.

465
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:11,093
我想我现在已经开始用过去的思维看待事情了
I guess I'm thinking of things in the past tense now.

466
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,074
很乐观吧?
How's that for optimism?

467
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:18,035
你是怎么变得那么有钱的?
What did you do to become so rich?

468
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,009
我卖掉我的公司
I sold my company.

469
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,071
什么样的公司?

470
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:25,020
-矿业公司  -你们采什么矿?

00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,044
非机械金属

472
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:34,062
我知道在鸡尾酒舞会上每个人都想和我说话

把你的手给我

她埋在哪儿?
Where is she buried?

476

-什么?  -听着

00:34:57,073 --> 00:35:01,027
你说你埋了你的妻子  告诉我在哪里

478
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:02,028
你想干什...

00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:05,066
-在哪儿? -丛林里
-Where?  -In the jungle.

480
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:07,063
热气球旁边  就在丛林里
By the balloon. In the jungle.

481
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,072
有多深?  你挖的坟墓有多深?
How deep?How deep did you dig the grave?

482
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,027
我不知...
I don't...

483
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,082
有多深?  有多少泥土?
How many shovelfuls of earth?

484
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:17,063
你是用手吗?  挖了多久?
Did you use your hands?How long did it take you?

485
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:20,079
-我记不起来了  -你记得起来的
-I don't remember.  -You would remember.

486
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,013
你会记得有多深
You would remember how deep.

487
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:26,066
你应该记得那时的每铲土
You would remember every shovelful,every moment.

488
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:31,069
你应该记得把一具尸体放进去时的感觉
You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside.

489
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,025
如果那个被埋的是你所爱的女人 你肯定会记得的
You would remember if you buried the woman you loved.

490
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:41,026
如果这些都是真的  你会记得的
You would remember if it were true.

491
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:47,046
那你...那你是不是也失去过谁?
Did you lose someone?

492
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:50,018
你是不是在这岛上失去了谁?
Did you lose someone here on the island?

493
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:51,066
你是不是也失去过谁?
Did you lose someone, too?

494
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,077
她怎么了?
What happened to her?

495
00:35:58,064 --> 00:36:00,062
那是一场意外
It was an accident.

496
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:02,051
那是一场意外
It was an accident.

497
00:36:02,051 --> 00:36:06,019
杀她的那个女弄错了
The woman responsible thought she was someone else,

498
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,018
以为她是去害她的
someone coming to hurt her,

499
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,081
就像你这样的人
someone like you.

500
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:14,044
这...这...都是误会
Just, just... This is all a mistake.

501
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:16,071
我们慢慢谈  好吗?
Slow down here, OK?

502
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,075
伤害我也不能让她起死回生
Hurting me isn't gonna bring her back.

503
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,018

Sayid

510
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:38,085

Jack  这是不得已的事
This has to happen.

马上
Now.

你现在让我干什么  我都照做
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

520
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:03,082
我想要你告诉我真相
I want you to tell me the truth.

521
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:06,040
把门打开
Open the door.

522
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:09,043
-放开我  Jack  -不放怎样?
-Let go of me, Jack.  -Or what?

523
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:13,032
你想按按键?  打开门
Wanna push the button?Open the door.

524
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:20,090
只剩一分钟了John  你最好考虑快点
It's under a minute now, John.You better think fast.

525
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:22,032
-你不会的  -什么?
-You wouldn't.  -What?

526
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,039
我不会什么?
I wouldn't what?

527
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,067
如果我没...你想拿大家的命赌博?
If we don't...You would risk everyone's lives?

528
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,011
上次是你说服我按按键的  John
You talked me into pushing that button once, John,

529
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:31,050
但是现在我说你
but it's yours now.

530
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,034
你是那个不肯冒一下险的人  你
You're the one who won't risk it. You.

531
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,070
我?  我觉得它到了零什么事也不会发生
I don't think anything's gonna happen when we get to zero.

532
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,031
-Jack...  -你想看看会发生什么事吗?
-Jack.  -You wanna see?

533
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:41,035
那我们就来看看将会发生什么
Let's just see what's gonna happen.

534
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:44,041
你是谁?
Who are you?

535
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:53,054
好吧  好吧  好吧  右15  左...
OK, OK, OK. Right 15, left...

536
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:57,006
你当我傻么?  你去开
You think I'm stupid? You open it.

537
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,099
-他在撒谎 -没有
-He's lying.  -Not like this!

538
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,039
我会告诉你你想知道的
I'll tell you whatever you want.

539
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,005
他在说谎  他在说谎
He's lying! He's lying!

540
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,060
够了
That's enough!

541
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:04,092
到底想怎样?
What the hell was that?

542
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,000
他是他们中的一个
He is one of them.

543
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,003
他说了没?
Did he tell you that?

544
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:13,060
那你怎么知道?
Then how do you know?

545
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:16,057
因为我知道
Because I know.

546
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:19,049
他是他们其中一个
He is one of them.

547
00:39:20,073 --> 00:39:23,097
Rousseau当初也是这么认为你的吧  Sayid
I think that's what Rousseau thought about you once, Sayid.

548
00:39:23,098 --> 00:39:26,047
没记错的话  她设了陷阱把你捆住 而且用电击你
She strapped you down, she shocked you,

549
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:29,068
都是因为她认为你是他们中的一个
all because she thought you were one of them.

550
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:31,074
他是的
He is.

551
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:33,073
什么?
What?

552
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,044
他是他们中的一个
He is one of them.

553
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:39,084
对Rousseau来说  我们都是其他人
To Rousseau, we're all Others.

554
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:44,027
我想这都是相对而言的  是么
I guess it's all relative, huh?

555
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,084
你有妻子么?
You got a wife?

556
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,041
孩子?
Kids?

557
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:49,057
我来
I'll take him.

558
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:58,020
结束了  我们不去巴格达了
It's over. We're pulling out,not going to Baghdad.

559
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,036
你们的领袖萨达姆仍旧可以掌握政权 也就是说
Your man Saddam gets to stay in power,

560
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:05,006
你几乎肯定将继续为他效力
which means you, in all likelihood,will remain in his employ.

561
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:09,080
而且你还掌握拷问技能
I guess you're lucky you have a new skill set you can use.

562
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,091
你让我做的那些事...
What you made me do, no human being

563
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:16,039
人类之间不能这么做
should ever have to do to another.

564
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,013
将来....
One of these days...

565
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:25,030
你会想明白的
there will be something you need to know.

566
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,025
但是现在...
And now...

567
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,000
你知道怎么去得到你想知道的了
you know how to get it.

568
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:34,055
我不会再这么做了
I will never do that again.

569
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:39,016
好吧
Yeah.

570
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:46,044
祝你好运  Sayid
Good luck to you, Sayid.

571
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:49,051
给你回拉马蒂的车费
Bus fare back to Ramadi.

572
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:52,002
我们出发
Let's move out.

573
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,070
舱里有一个人...
There is a man down in the hatch.

574
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:22,071
Rousseau抓住的一个陌生人
A stranger captured by Rousseau.

575
00:42:24,014 --> 00:42:26,074
我打了他
I beat him.

576
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,098
我狠狠打了他
I beat him badly.

577
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,057
为什么告诉我这些  Sayid?
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?

578
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,097
Jack问我怎么知道...
Jack asked me how I knew,

579
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:45,057
这个人在撒谎
knew for sure that this man was lying,

580
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:50,006
我怎么知道他是其他人中的一个
how I knew for sure that he was one of them, one of the Others.

581
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:56,052
我知道是因为我这么对他我一点也没内疚感
I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him.

582
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:09,048
但是这是我对Jack甚至是Lock解释不清的...
But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack, or even Locke,

583
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:12,065
因为他们两个都已经忘记了
because both of them have forgotten.

584
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:16,001
忘记了?  什么?
Forgotten? What?

585
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:19,045
你被吊着脖子挂在树上留着等死
That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead.

586
00:43:19,046 --> 00:43:24,020
Claire被绑架了好几天 没人知道在她身上发生了什么
That Claire was kept for days during which God knows what happened to her.

587
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,064
这些人
That these people,

588
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:28,010
这些"其他人"
these Others,

589
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:30,041
是多么无情...
are merciless

590
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:34,035
他们可以在任何时候 带走我们中的任何一个
and can take any one of us whenever they choose.

591
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,039
所以告诉我  Charlie
So, tell me, Charlie,

592
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:47,040
你忘记了么?
have you forgotten?

593
