我觉得不是食谱的问题

他不会吃的  别给自己添麻烦  孩子

42
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,070

他为什么这么关心  这人是个敌人

他是你的头  对吧
He's your leader, right?

53
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,030
那只是个监视器
It's just a camera.

54

他们能看见  但听不见
They can see, but they can't hear.

55

四年前  我跑进了丛林

56

How'd it go?

64
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,089
他想贿赂我

65
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,068
-可我不吃那套  -那必然

-你干完了 -什么意思

就这样了吗
So that's it?

00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:01,019
我帮你杀了那些人
I killed all those people for you

76
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,091
你就如此扬长而去
And now you're just... w-walking away?

77
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:06,034
你不是为我卖命  Sayid
You didn't kill them for me, sayid.

78
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:08,081
是你自己要他们的名字的
You're the one that asked for their names.

79
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,038
Widmore的组织人员已经全被歼灭

那我现在做什么
What do I do now?

我觉得你应该回到自己的生活
I suppose you should go live your life.

现在你该告诉我们你的名字了
Now's the part where you tell me your name.

92
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:29,018
你得告诉我你在丛林里做什么
I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle.

93
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:33,018
-问他那模型的事 -Radzinsky 让我来说
- Ask him about the model. - I-- Radzinsky. I got this.

94
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:38,031
那些手铐
Those handcuffs--

95
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:43,004
你和你的人之间出了什么问题吗
Are you having some kind of problem with your people?

96
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:45,094
因为你们之间有了分歧
Because either you were in some kind of disagreement,

97
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:48,038
所以让我来帮你
Which makes me wanna help you,

98
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,061
又或者你是来做卧底的
Or you're a spy trying to infiltrate us.

99
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,048
到底是什么
So which is it?

100
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,028
好吧
Okay.

101
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:10,021
我给你一个小时考虑
I'm gonna give you an hour to decide

102
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:12,054
看你是否会告诉我
Whether you wanna talk to me.

103
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:16,021
如果你闭口不谈
But if you decide you don't want to...

104
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:20,011
不要怪我做绝了
Then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level.

105
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,058
你的培根好了
I think your bacon's ready.

106
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,072
我忘了
I forgot.

107
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:49,024
电视里演什么呢
What's on the tv?

108
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,001
结束了  不是吗
It's over, isn't it?

109
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:02,071

00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,048
所有的一切
All of it.

113
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,098
我从没想过他们会回来
I never actually thought they'd come back.

114
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,031
他们回来了  什么也没变
So they're back. nothing's changed.

115
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,081
Sayid要是告诉他们自己的身份了怎么办
What if sayid tells them who he is?

116
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,089
Sayid会守口如瓶
Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'.

117
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:27,022
不会出乱子的
I got this under control.

118
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,054
早上好  H

120
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:41,098
我刚跟那囚犯谈了  现在有个问题
I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem.

121
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,004
怎么了  他说什么了
Why? what'd he say?

122
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:48,051
什么也没说  所以我才担心
Nothing, which is what worries me.

123
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:51,015
我们得知道他为何打破休战协议
We need to find out why he violated the truce,

124
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,078
他为什么来我们的领地
Why the hell he would come into our territory.

125
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:56,071
我得让Oldham来拷问他
I'm just gonna have to have Oldham do his thing on him.

126
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:01,001
那个精神病吗  不可以
That psychopath? no way!

127
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:04,048
我还有什么选择余地
What choice do I have?

128
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:07,025
就让他自己一个人待着
Just let me have go at him alone.

129
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,081
随便  不过我告诉你
Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man,

130
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,074
他不会说的
He is not gonna talk.

131
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,021
他会跟我说的
Oh, he'll talk to me.

132
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:20,011
-Lafleur先生 -去吃午餐吧  Phil
- Mr. Lafleur.  - Take your lunch, Phil.

133
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,051
你要自己进去吗
You going back there alone?

134
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,064
去吃午餐  Phil
Take your lunch, Phil.

135
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,058
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,091
你怎么样了
How you doing?

137
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,091
一个12岁的Ben Linus
A 12-year-old Ben Linus

138
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:40,049
给了我带了个鸡肉沙拉三明治
Brought me a chicken salad sandwich.

139
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,078
-你觉得我该怎么办  -他很可爱吧
- How do you think I'm doing? - Sweet kid, huh?

140
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,088
你怎么能和他住一起
How can you live with him here?

141
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,048
我别无选择
'cause I ain't got a choice.

142
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:52,038
真的吗
Is that so?

143
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,094
你在70年代生活三年后会有什么感觉
Let's see how you feel after 3 years of living in the '70s.

144
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:57,024
算你运气好
Lucky for you...

145
00:11:57,024 --> 00:12:01,049
我用这段时间爬到这个位置  来救你
I spent that time getting myself in a position to save your ass.

146
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,088
对不起  Sayid
I'm sorry, Sayid.

147
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,012
-干什么  -我告诉他们你会招供
- What are you doing? - When I tell them I got your confession,

148
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,061
我要他们相信你没有轻易屈服
I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy.

149
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:21,094
-供认什么  -我们得串词  说你是来投奔我们的
- What confession?- We're gonna say you were trying to defect.

150
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,088
你要招出一些岛上居民的情报
You were gonna offer some intel on the others

151
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,097
才能融入我们
In exchange for living with us.

152
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:27,059
我怎么可能这样做
And why in god's name would I want to do that?

153
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,055
-否则我应该怎么办  -放我走
- What the hell else am I supposed to do with you? - Let me go.

154
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:33,018
然后呢  我不能就这样放了你
And then what? I can't just let you go.

155
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,038
为什么不
Why not?

156
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:38,024
因为这些人信任我
Because these people trust me.

157
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,038
我在这里营造了幸福生活
I've built a life here, and a pretty good one.

158
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,064
我放了你  这些就全完了
I let you go, all that goes away.

159
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:46,015
你要做出选择
So you got yourself a choice, chief.

160
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,081
要么合作并加入达摩组织
Either you cooperate and join the party in darmahville,

161
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,084
要么孤军奋战
Or you're on your own.

162
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,058
我选择孤军奋战
Then I guess I'm on my own.

163
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,027
新鲜饼出炉
Fresh show，the gratal.

164
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,058
他们尝试了不同的沙司口味
and they've tried different sauces.

165
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:08,018
他们真的很有一手
They are really up in hand

166
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,085
谢谢  Hurley
Thanks,Hurley

167
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,005
Sayid怎么样了
So, what's going on with Sayid

168
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,025
我毫不知情
I don't know anything yet.

169
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,046
什么意思
What do you mean you don't know any thing

170
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,072
我以为你和Saywer昨晚在一起
I thought you with saywer last night

171
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:20,077
他说了什么
What did he tell you

172
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,005
他叫我别打扰他  让他做自己的事
He told me leave him alone and let him do his job

173
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:25,011
你就这么做了吗
And you are going to?

174
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,090
我要和Juliet谈谈  看看她会不会告诉我
I'll talk to Juliet and see would she can tell me

175
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,087
Sawyer没有说  Juliet又怎么会说呢
Sawyer didn't tell you anything.Why would Juliet

176
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,024
她又怎么会说呢
why wouldn't she

177
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:34,030
因为他们在一起
Coz they're together

178
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,052
在一起是什么意思
What do you mean together

179
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:40,079
他们两情相悦  他们住一起  但不仅是室友
Together. They lived together and not like roommates

180
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,053
就像你们曾经这样
Together like you guys were

181
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:47,004
这很明显
That was obvious.

182
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,007
谁能预见这点呢
I mean who can see that coming

183
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:51,017
Hurley
Hurley

184
00:13:55,016 --> 00:14:00,052
我还是去烧几个煎饼吧
Well, I guess I better go make some more waffers.

185
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:06,001
你知道这件事吗
Did you know?

186
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,017
知道
Yeah.

187
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:36,061
你知道我想不通什么吗
You know what I can't figure out?

188
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:39,024
你怎么会被抓的
Is how the hell you got caught.

189
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:42,053
你们是"丛林之王"
You hostiles are supposed to be the kings of the jungle.

190
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:45,046
你怎么会笨到被这些白痴抓住呢
And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots?

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,054
而你是他们中垫底的
And yet you're the one who mops up after them.

192
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,060
好吧
Yeah, well...

193
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:57,014
我们等着瞧你被Oldman修理后的样子
We'll see how cute you are once oldham gets done with you,pal.

194
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,061
你在这做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

195
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:10,007
我给你送个三明治
I was bringing you a sandwich.

196
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,036
三明治
A sandwich?

197
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,003
你从没给我做过三明治
You never made me a sandwich in your life.

198
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:19,047
是啊  我是给自己做的
Yeah, well... I-I made one for myself...

199
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:23,010
-所以我想带给你  -是吗
So...So I just thought that I'd bring you - Oh, yeah? You just...

200
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,073
-爸爸  不要  -别对我撒谎
-Dad, don't!- Don't you lie to me.

201
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:31,020
你来这干什么
What are you doin' down here?

202
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:36,094
你是为他做的三明治  是不是
You made this sandwich for him, didn't you?

203
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:38,026
是的
Yes.

204
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,070
-谁让你这么做的  -没有人
- Who told you to do that?- nobody.

205
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,071
-没有人吗  -我只是想
- Nobody?- I just thought that--

206
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,091
你"只是想"  是吧
You "just thought," huh?

207
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,041
回家去
Go home.

208
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,077
快走  我会帮你洗脑
Go on. I'll tell you what to think.

209
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,080
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

210
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,041
到处看看
I looked.

211
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:40,070
你想干什么  Ben
What do you want, Ben?

212
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:43,031
John Locke死了
John Locke is dead.

213
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,014
我想他是被谋杀的
I think he was murdered.

214
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:50,093
怎么会有人杀他
Why would anyone kill him?

215
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,093
我觉得是报复
I'd say it was retribution

216
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:56,007
我们俩做的事情
For the work you and I have been doing.

217
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,007
你很危险  Sayid
So you're in danger, Sayid.

218
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:01,038
如果我能找到你  那些人也能找到Locke
If I can find you, so can the people that found locke--

219
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,033
那些人  我们说话这会儿
The same people who, even as we speak,

220
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:07,014
正坐在Hugo的精神病院外面
Are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution.

221
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:09,014
他们在监视他吗
They're watching him?

222
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:12,034
整个星期都有人在那儿的
A man in a sedan has been there all week,

223
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:15,083
坐等
Just waiting...

224
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:18,083
你我现身
Presumably for you or me to show our faces.

225
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:21,084
所以你来这里
And that's why you're here?

226
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:25,030
你大老远来是想我杀了他吗
You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man?

227
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,041
你不想吗
You don't want to?

228
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:30,064
你为什么觉得我想
What makes you think I want to?

229
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:33,004
因为  Sayid
Because, Sayid...

230
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,004
简单的说
To put it simply--

231
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,083
你的绝活无人能及
You're capable of things that most other men aren't.

232
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,080
你做的每个选择
Every choice you've made in your life,

233
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,027
无论是谋杀还是拷问
Whether it was to murder or to torture,

234
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:45,054
都不是真正的选择
It hasn't really been a choice at all, has it?

235
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:47,098
这是你的天性  你的本质
It's in your nature. It's what you are.

236
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:52,040
你是杀手  Sayid
You're a killer, Sayid.

237
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:02,073
我不是你想的那样
I'm not what you think I am.

238
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:07,001
我不喜欢杀人
I don't like killing.

239
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,041
好吧  那我道歉
Well, then I apologize.

240
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,091
我看错你了
I was mistaken about you.

241
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,017
最后一次机会
All right, last chance.

242
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,051
你有什么要说的吗
You got anything to say?

243
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:52,050
把他带到Oldham那里
Take him to Oldham.

244
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,000
Oldham
Oldham.

245
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,008
准备好了吗
Hey, man. are we ready?

246
00:19:54,003 --> 00:19:56,047
他是谁
Who is that man?

247
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,063
你的翻版
He's our you.

248
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,077
最好把他绑好  固定住
Better put him in the restraints.

249
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,034
别担心
Don't worry.

250
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,043
这是为了保护你的
They're for your protection.

251
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,068
我要给你的东西会有副作用
There are side effects to what I'm giving you.

252
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:49,093
撬开他的嘴
Open his mouth.

253
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,054
张开
Open up.

254
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,071
别怕
Don't be afraid.

255
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:10,070
转移注意力  让它起作用吧
Just turn your mind off. let it take effect.

256
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:17,083
你无法控制住
It's beyond your control,

257
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,090
反抗只会更消耗你的能量
So fighting it is a poor use of your energies.

258
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,048
无论你是否挣扎  有一件事是确定的  朋友
Whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend.

259
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:33,053
你会告诉我们真相
You will tell us the truth.

260
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:46,008
有人在洛杉矶
There's somebody-- Somebody here in los angeles.

261
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,098
-我带你们去见他  -谁
- Let me take you to them.- Who?

262
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,038
就是告诉我们
The same person that's gonna show us

263
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,024
-怎么回小岛的那个人  -是这样吗
- How to get back to the island.- is that what this is about?

264
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:59,059
太疯狂了  你们都疯了
This is insane. you are all crazy.

265
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,085
Sayid  你去哪
Sayid, where are you going?

266
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:07,002
我不参与这事
I don't want any part of this.

267
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,025
如果我再看见你
And if I see you again,

268
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,048
我们俩都不会愉快的
It'll be extremely unpleasant for us both.

269
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:24,002
你有菜单吗
Ahh. do you have a menu?

270
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:26,001
给你
There you go.

271
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,097
先生  还要MacCutcheon吗
Sir? another maccutcheon?

272
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:29,082
好的  谢谢
Please.

273
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:33,078
你有什么烦心事
What's that run you?

274
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,027
什么
Excuse me?

275
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,018
苏格兰酒
That Scotch.

276
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,017
那酒是怎么回事
What's a glass of that run you?

277
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:43,092
不管那是什么  都很值
Whatever it is, it's worth it.

278
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,058
我不理解
I don't understand

279
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:49,021
为什么会有人花120元买一杯饮料
Why someone uld pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.

280
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:55,042
如果你知道我的酒的价格  为什么还要问我
If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me?

281
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:05,068
和我不在饭桌上  却在这里用餐原因相同
Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table.

282
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,062
给我一份半熟的牛眼肉
I'll have the rib eye, bloody.

283
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:10,058
好的  女士  一份半熟牛排
Yes, ma'am. rib eye, bloody.

284
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,054
你是职业的吗
Are you a professional?

285
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:19,015
职业的什么
A professional what?

286
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:22,047
你觉得我是个妓女吗
You think I'm a prostitute?

287
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:27,062
我不是妓女  我只是
I'm not a professional anything. I just...

288
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,028
觉得你看起来很忧郁
Thought you looked sad.

289
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,008

290
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,002
很遗憾听到你这么说
I'm sorry to hear that.

291
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:42,085
那么
So...

292
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:47,060
除了在酒吧独自饮酒
Other than drinking alone at bars...

293
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:50,035
你是做什么的
What do you do?

294
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:52,066
谋生行业
For a living.

295
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:55,025
我正在找工作
I'm between jobs at the moment.

296
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:58,078
那你之前做什么
So what did you do?

297
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:02,038
做我之前唯一擅长的事情
The only thing I was ever good at.

298
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:05,022
那你怎么不干了
Then why did you quit?

299
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,045
我在试着做些改变
I'm trying to change.

现在我知道你为什么忧郁了
I know why you're sad now.

301

是吗
Do you?

302

当你擅长于某件事的时候
When you are that good at something,

303
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,075
总会有一些人
There are always going to be people

304
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:24,017
诱惑你干老本行
Who tempt you into staying the same.

305
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:33,068
你怎么对诱惑了解这么多
And how do you know so much about temptation?

306
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:37,068
请我喝一杯威士忌  我就告诉你
buy me a glass of that scotch,and i will tell you

307
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,095
喂

我希望你放轻松  如实地回答我的问题

我们找到你的时候  你为什么带着手铐
Why were you in handcuffs when we found you?

317
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:28,078
因为
Because...

318
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:33,045
因为我是个坏人
Because I am a bad man.

319
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,017
你是要逃避你们的人的追捕
Were you running away from your people?

320
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:37,072
什么人
What people?

321
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,098
我们的敌人

322
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:43,088

乘飞机来的
I came on a plane.

327
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,044
我就是这么回到岛上的
And that's how I returned to the island.

328
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,035
"回到"  你之前来过这里吗
"returned"? you've been here before?

329
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,061
是的
Oh, yes.

330
00:25:58,065 --> 00:26:00,025
第一次

331
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,058
我乘坐的是大洋号815航班
I was on oceanic flight 8-1-5.

332
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,062
它坠毁了

然后我离开了
Then I left.

335

问问Saywer

336
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:15,005
-谁是Sawyer  -管他呢
- Who's "sawyer"? - Who cares?!

337
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:18,022
这些都不重要  问问他关于火焰站的事
None of this matters. ask him about the flame.

338
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,028
安静点
Quiet.

339
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,062
你对我们这儿的站点知道多少

我知道火焰站是个通讯站

珍珠站用来监视其他的站点

天鹅站用来研究电磁学

00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:36,052
但是  当然了  这是在事故发生之前

344
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,063
天鹅站? 他怎么知道我们准备取的名字
The swan? How could he know what we were gonna name it?

345
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,003
我们还没建成呢
We haven't even built it yet!

346
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:43,061
我告诉过你  他见过模型
I told you! He saw our model.

347

看见没有  他是个间谍  我早就知道

你们会被杀光
You're going to be killed.

353

你怎么知道这些的  Sayid
How exactly would you know this, sayid?

354
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:12,033
因为我来自未来世界
Because I am from the future.

355
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:18,094
或许我该给你灌点药
Maybe I should've used half a dropper.

356
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,007
你
You...

357
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,071
你用的剂量刚刚好

你这边四个引擎准备得怎么样
How are you with a flat four engine?

361
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,046
你不知道我在说什么  对吧
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

362
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,046
不  不太清楚
no, not really.

363
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:49,066
没关系
It's okay.

364
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,066
Jack跟你说过我们的事
Jack told you about us...

365
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:58,060
没有  是Hurley告诉我的
No. hurley, actually.

366
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:07,083
这让我如释重负  真的
It's kind of a relief, actually.

367
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:10,029
我没想好该如何开口
I wasn't quite sure how to do it

368
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:13,063
又不让你感到我想打发你走
Without it sounding like I was telling you to stay away.

369
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,093
没事的
It's fine.

370
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,003
好吧
All right...

371
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,099
我们该怎么处置他
What do we do with him?

372
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:49,033
杀了他
We kill him.

373
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:54,063
等等  我们不杀人的  对吧
Hold on a second. we're not killing anyone, right?

374
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,046
他触犯了休战协定
He violated the truce.

375
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:59,029
你想如果他们抓住我们中的一个  怎么处置
What do you think they would do if they caught one of us?

376
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,039
从什么时候开始我们变得和他们一样了
Since when did we start acting like them?

377
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,083
-我们是文明人  -没错  我们是文明人
- We're civilized. - yes, we are.

378
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:06,000
我们有法律规则
We have a rule of law.

379
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:09,049
我们给了他很多机会替自己辩解
And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself.

380
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:12,096
需要我提醒你一下  这个人看见的太多
need I remind you, this man's seen things?

381
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,016
知道的太多  无需商榷
He knows things. there's nothing to talk about.

382
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,029
你确定他是个间谍吗  傻子
He's a spy. you sure about that, stu?

383
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,029
他当时正从敌人那里逃脱
He was trying to escape from the hostiles.

384
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,034
很显然他和他们的人之间有矛盾
He obviously has problems with his people.

385
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,029
没错  分享我们的秘密
Yeah, and sharing our secrets

386
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,093
是帮助他们解决问题最快捷的途径
Are the quickest way for him to solve those problems.

387
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:31,016
-我需要多点时间来考虑  -还要考虑
- Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider. - consider?

388
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,019
我是说  他在这呆的时间越长
I mean, the longer he's among us,

389
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,064
我们就越危险
The--the more danger we're in.

390
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,015
我能和他谈谈  Horace  我只需要一点时间
I can talk to him, horace. I just need more time.

391
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:40,068
不  你有过一次机会了  Lafleur
No, you had your chance, lafleur!

392
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,056
为什么我们得听你的  Radzinsky
Why are we on your clock, radzinsky?

393
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:46,025
Horace  你得组织一次投票
Horace, you've got to call for a vote.

394
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:49,032
要不我们做个决定
Either we make a decision,

395
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:52,061
要不我打电话给Ann Arbor
Or I call ann arbor...

396
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,045
让他们替我们做决定
And they make it for us.

397
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:57,074
Radzinsky说得对
Radzinsky's right.

398
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,085
Horace  求求你
Horace, please...

399
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:04,002
我不能
I can't...

400
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:07,051
我不能提心吊胆地过日子
I can't sleep with one eye open.

401
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,085

我们得为这儿所有的孩子着想
We have to think about all the children here.

404
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:21,055
这个人在这里  我们怎么能有安全感呢
How are we going to feel safe with this man around?

405
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,072
我不知道他来做什么
I don't know what he's up to,

406
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:29,015
但是我们不能把他留在这儿
But we can't keep him here.

407
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,035
我么没得选
We have no choice.

408
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,025

外面的保卫是Phil  他是个笨蛋
