你敢掀起你的衬衫吗?

106
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:56,098

Juliet  我不认得这些东西

120
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,030
我以前也做过动物尸体解剖  因此...
I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if--if-- no.

121
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,095
-我们不能相信他们  -瞧  Dan  我早跟你说过

他们早已认定我们会杀害他们
They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em.

正是这样他们才不信任我们
It's exactly why they don't trust us.

127
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,032
别这样了
Come on.

128
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,037

00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:05,070
不要把这些事  所发生的一切都怪罪在我们头上
Don't blame us for--for this, for whatever is happening.

130
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,092
我们是科学家  我们不想任何人受到伤害
We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt.

131
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,081
我们只想帮忙  求你让我们去
We just wanna help. Please let us help.

132
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,014
只要有他们一个企图逃跑  就朝他们的腿开枪
Either of them tries to run? Shoot 'em in the leg.

嘿  Juliet
Hey, juliet.

139
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:37,021
如果医疗救护站有我们需要的任何东西
If everything that we need is at the medical station,

140
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,005
-那我们为何不把Jack直接带到那去  -因为如果我们移动他   
-Then why don't we just bring jack there? -Because if we move him,

141
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,096
他的阑尾可能就因此破裂
There's a good chance that his appendix will rupture.

142
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,089
还有如果真这样了  他就会死
And if that happens, he's gonna die.

143
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,056
想都别想
Don't even think about it.

144
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,028
什么
What?

145
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:09,037
不准看她  不准和她说话
Don't look at her. Don't talk to her.

146
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,051
不准打扰她
Don't mess with her.

147
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,087
给你下禁令  离她20英尺远
You got a restraining order. 20 feet.

148
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,079
你是谁  她大哥哥?
What are you, her big brother?

149
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:21,097
不是  我是要狠狠揍你的人
No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face

150
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,041
除非你说  是的  我知道了
Unless you say, "yeah. I getcha."

151
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,018
是的  我知道了
Yeah. I getcha.

152
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,026
亲爱的  我相信Jack不会有事的 
Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay.

153
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,053
阑尾切除术
An appendectomy

154
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,048
是一种最常见的手术
Is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.

155
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,021
我不是在想这个
That's not what I was thinking about.

156
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,011
我在想  他怎么就生病了
I was thinking, "why did he get sick?"

157
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,038
怎么?  只是  只是运气不好罢了
Why? It's just-- it's just bad luck.

158
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,094
就在我们都以为要获救的时候
The day before we're all supposed to be rescued,

159
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,069
我们最依赖的人
The person that we count on the most

160
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,085
却突然陷入了生命危险
Suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition,

161
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:00,099
-而你却把这归因于运气不好?  -那你是说
-And you're chalking it up to bad luck? -Well, what are you saying,

162
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,075
难道Jack做了一些冒犯上帝的事
That--that Jack did something to offend the gods?

163
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:08,031
-人们生病了  Rose  -不是在这
People get sick, Rose. -Not here.

164
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:12,031
在这里  他们都更好了
Here, they get better.

165
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,084
你最后一次这样做是什么时候
When was the last time you did this?

166
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:27,071
你说的是阑尾切除术还是给男人刮肚子?
An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?

167
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,080
在我的住处
In my residency.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,031
我做过很多这样的手术
I did a lot of 'em back then.

169
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,001
那你应该知道切口在
Then you know the incision needs to be

170
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,018
你刮的地方往下2英寸
2 inches lower than where you're shaving.

171
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,042
我只是在清洗这块
I'm just cleaning the area.

172
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,046
谢谢你
Thank you.

173
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,097
我想跟你谈谈
I wanna talk you through it.

174
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,006
什么?
What?

175
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,018
我不想失去意识
I don't want to be unconscious.

176
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,035
我们可以用利多卡因(一种局部麻醉剂)
We can use the lidocaine

177
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:06,020
这样我就能看到手术过程
And then I can watch the procedure,

178
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,001
帮助你
Help you out.

179
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:11,004
你躺平了我手又在腹腔
And, uh, how are you gonna watch

180
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:14,028
你怎么能够看到
Flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?

181
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,086
我们可以用镜子  Kate来拿
We can use a mirror. kate can hold it.

182
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,062
如果需要人的话
If someone's going to be in there,

183
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:27,003
难道不应该是有手术经验的人吗?
Shouldn't it be someone with medical experience?

184
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,090
-Bernard医生  -不  我希望Kate在这
-Bernard's a dentist-- -No, I want it to be kate.

185
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,089
别担心  Berenberg小姐  你的状态很好
Don't worry, Ms. berenberg. You're in good hands.

186
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,084
-那明天早上5点见  -好的
-I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? -Mm-hmm.

187
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,005
记住  不要吃太硬的食物  好吗
And remember, no solid food. okay?

188
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:48,040
-谢谢  医生  -祝你晚上愉快  
-Thank you, doctor. -Have a good evening.

189
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,076
你看一下这张X射线图?
Will you take a look at this x-ray?

190
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:03,068
是14号的  我想知道你的看法  L4号  好的
-Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think. -The L4. yeah. yeah.

191
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:06,032
Shephard医生  有你的电话
Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you.

192
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,000
是Stillman从Santa rosa医院打来的

治疗毫无效果
Therapy's... been rendered useless.

198
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,053
为何会这样呢?
And why is that?

199
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,086
因为他认为我不存在
Because he doesn't think I exist.

200
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,004
你为什么不吃药呢
Why aren't you taking your meds?

201
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,011
因为我们快死了
Cause we're dead...

202
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,017
我们所有人
All of us.

203
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,038
大洋航班六人  都要死了

207
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,006
我今天干了什么

208
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,036
我...
I, uh...

209

起床后  洗了个澡
I woke up, took a shower.

210
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,029
我和Kate一起喂孩子吃饭

211
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,085
我还以为你不想和Aaron扯上关系

就像是在天堂

217
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,080
不能因为我很幸福
Just because I'm happy

218
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:47,058
就说这不是真的  Hurley
Doesn't mean that this isn't real, hurley.

219
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:49,018
不管怎样  我也曾经幸福过  Jack
I was happy, too, jack...

220

00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,024
真的很酷
It's pretty cool, actually.

225
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,067
很好啊  那么你们俩都说些什么呢
Okay.  so what do the two of you talk about?

226

昨天他告诉我你要来看我

他叫我给你捎个信

"你不该抚养他  Jack"

231
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,017
不  这...毫无道理
No, that... doesn't make any sense.

吃药  Hurley
Take your meds, hurley.

-你可以帮我吗? -我...我想还是不要了
You wanna help me out? um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.

Jack想看手术  "跟我说话"

他没流太多血
He didn't lose that much blood.

419
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,082
我想我取出了阑尾
I got the appendix out

420
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,049
然后把一切归位
And put everything back where it belongs, I think.

421
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,006
那他没事了?
So he's gonna be okay?

422
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,059
他会好的
He should be fine.

423
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,075

回来  Jack亲了我

什么?
Prove what?

435
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,049
他不爱别人
