她快死了  也许她看见了

隧道里的亮光  Paulo在撒谎

Baby, look at me. Look at me.

157
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,086
那个包在哪里?
Where's the bag?

158
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,016
什么?
What?

159
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:08,060
Paulo  那个包在哪里?
The bag.Paulo, where is it?

160
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,014
我告诉你  这个是踪迹
I'm telling you, this is the trail.

161
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,063
你对追踪了解多少?
What do you know about tracking?

162
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:18,024
可我知道脚印是什么
Well, I know what a footprint is.

163
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,034
在这边
Over here.

164
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,045
我猜他就是  Paulo
I'm guessin' that's Paulo.

165
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,098
他和Nikki一样  没有任何受伤的痕迹
He's just like Nikki. No wound, nothing.

166
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,050
是啊
Yeah, I know.

167
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:47,025
他裤子怎么没穿好?
Why are his pants undone?

168
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,000
他的鞋怎么会在树上?
And why is his shoe in that tree?

169
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,003
也许他踩到什么了
Maybe he stepped on something.

170
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:58,054
你看见什么了?
You see something?

171
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,051
Sawyer
Sawyer?

172
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,078
什么也没有
Nothing.

173
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,034
不!
No.

174
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:08,029
不要
Don't.

175
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,004
伙计  你在干嘛?
Dude,what are you doing?

176
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,009
已经死了两个人了
Two people are dead.

177
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,071
你有没有想过他们是被毒死的?
You ever think they might have been poisoned.

178
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:20,030
- 这是证据  你破坏了犯罪现场  - 犯罪现场?
-That's evidence.You're messing up the crime scene.  -Crime scene?

179
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,013
还有哪个藏食品的舱门你没告诉我?
Is there a forensics hatch I don't know about?

180
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,035
停下
Stop!

181
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,044
怪物
Monster.

182
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,062
我还要和你说多少遍
How many times do I have to tell you,

183
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:35,030
那里根本没有什么怪物
there's no such thing as monsters?

184
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,036
也许那是只恐龙
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

185
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:40,060
这不是"珠罗纪公园"  Paulo  这是南太平洋
It's not "Jurassic Park," Paulo.It's the South Pacific.

186
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:43,067
那么那是什么?  你看见树在移动
Then what was it? You saw the trees move.

187
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:47,056
你可以关心些别的事吗?  已经6天了
Would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, okay?

188
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,055
海岸巡逻队随时会来救我们
The coast guard is gonna get here any second,

189
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,056
他们不会接受
and I really don't think that they're gonna take,

190
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:53,045
"我还没找到我的旅行包"
"hey, you know what?I'm looking for my script bag"

191
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:56,045
作为理由而不肯上救生船!
as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.

192
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,078
你们丢行李了吗?
Did you guys lose your luggage?

193
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,046
我也是  不过我也找到了其他一些东西
I lost mine, too.I found some other stuff, though,

194
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:07,019
如果你们需要什么...裤子啊  毛衣啊...
so if you need anything,pants or sweatshirt...

195
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,024
我能帮你们找到合适的
I can help you find some that fit.

196
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,067
我叫Ethan
I'm Ethan, by the way.

197
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:15,061
我是Nikki...  你好Nikki
Hi. I'm Nikki...

198
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,054
这是Paulo
and this is Paulo.

199
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,069
Paulo  你真好  Ethan
And you are so sweet, Ethan,

200
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,067
但实际上我们在找其他东西
but actually, we're not looking for clothes.

201
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,038
Paulo丢了他的尼古丁口香糖
Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.

202
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,054
也许在内陆能找到些
You might have more luck looking inland.

203
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:31,042
在丛林里?  飞机在岛的上空分开了
In the jungle? The plane split apart when it was over the island,

204
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,057
所以有些东西可能在那里
so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.

205
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:37,043
Boone  是Boone拿了水
Boone took the water!

206
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:40,004
没人会理解的到底怎么了?
What is going on?

207
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,068
有人要负起责任来
Someone had to take responsibility.

208
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,030
否则水就不会剩多少了  闭嘴!
It would have never lasted.

209
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,009
不要吵了!
Leave him alone!

210
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:51,045
已经6天了
It's been six days,

211
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:55,018
我们一直在等待着救援
and we're all still waiting for someone to come.

212
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:58,061
现在我们不能这样干等着了
We have to stop waiting.

213
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:02,090
我们要想出生存的办法来
We need to start figuring things out.

214
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,058
我找到水源了
Now I found water,

215
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:07,040
在山谷的深处
fresh water up in the valley.

216
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,095
明天一早我就会叫人一起去
I'm taking a group at first light.

217
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:11,035
如果你不想去的话
If y don't want to come,

218
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:14,086
那就贡献点其他的
then find another way to contribute,

219
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:19,039
因为人人为己是行不通的
because every man for himself is not gonna work.

220
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:23,099
如果我们不能同舟共济...
But if we can't live together...

221
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:28,088
我们都会死的
we're gonna die alone.

222
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,031
我和Jin意见一致 是那怪物干的
I'm with Jin.It's the monster.

223
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,029
是啊  这比较说的通
Yeah, because that makes the most sense.

224
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,074
是这样的  Locke说Eko死的时候
It does.Locke said when Eko died,

225
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,068
他的最后一句话是  "你是下一个"
his last words were, "you're next,"

226
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,058
Nikki和Paulo当时和他们在一起
and Nikki and Paulo were with them.

227
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,024
他说的是他们
He was talking about them.

228
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:49,032
他说"你是下一个" 不是指他们
He wasn't saying "you're next" about them.He was saying "you're next"

229
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:53,005
他是指我们大家
as in you're all next.

230
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:55,003
那更糟了不是
Yeah, that's not really better.

231
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:58,013
好了  我们这样吧
All right, so here's how I see it.

232
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,066
我们想知道发生了什么事?
We wanna know what happened?

233
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:02,071
就要弄清楚Jabonies(绰号)的底细
We gotta find out whatever we can about these jabonies.

234
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,089
Ja-bo-nies?
Ja-bo-nies?

235
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,028
Nina和pablo  伙计  尊重他们一点
Nina and Pablo. Dude, show some respect.

236
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,053
你知道他们的名字  Nikki和Paulo
You know their names.It Nikki and Paulo.

237
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:13,037
随便啦Hugo  他们的帐篷在哪里?
Whatever, Hugo. Where's their tent?

238
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,054
我们最好弄点铁锹来
And we better get some shovels.

239
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,097
Arzt博士
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

240
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:30,089
你是科学家是吗?
You're a scientist, right?

241
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,004
还是一个教育家
And an educator, yes.

242
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,095
你在干嘛呢?
What are you doing with all this stuff?

243
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:38,072
自从我们来这儿后我又发现了20种新的种类
Well, since we got here,I've discovered 20 new species.

244
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,040
我将会成为下一个查尔斯.达尔文
I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.

245
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:47,071
那是皇后蛛  非常危险
That is, latrodectus regina.Very dangerous.

246
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,092
他们称为美杜莎蜘蛛
They call her the medusa spider.

247
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:52,015
她的雌性激素很强  只要一阵风
Her pheromones are very strong,one whiff,

248
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:55,071
所有的雄性同类马上就会来的
and every male of the species would be here in seconds.

249
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,059
当然那不像你
Not unlike you, I guess.

250
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:02,020
所以你很忙  不能帮我咯
So you're probably too busy to help me, then.

251
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,013
不不不 
No, not at all.

252
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:07,036
我能帮你  我能为你做些什么?
I'm fine. I can help you.What can I do you for?

253
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,044
自从飞机失事后
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

254
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,053
我就一直在找我的行李
and since the plane broke apart over the jungle,

255
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:17,006
你是否知道一些弹道的原理
I was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.

256
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,064
我吗?
Do I?

257
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:21,037
我知道吗?
Do I know about trajectories?

258
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:24,045
让我给你画张地图  女士
Allow me to draw you a map, madam.

259
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,086
我们要相信
Are you sure we should be listening

260
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,041
一个高中科学老师吗?
to a high school science teacher?

261
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,095
初中老师  是的
Junior high, and yes.

262
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:36,046
这和Leslie有什么关系?
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

263
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,092
Leslie
Leslie?

264
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,093
你嫉妒了
You're jealous!

265
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:42,005
嫉妒他?  永远不会
Of him? Never.

266
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:44,038
是啊  他的蜘蛛让我好兴奋
Yeah, his spiders turned me on so much,

267
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,039
我要和他睡觉才能得到这张地图
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

268
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,099
如果你和Zuckerman上床的话这也就没什么奇怪的了
I wouldn't be surprised.You slept with Zuckerman.

269
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,075
我这么做是为了我们
I did that for us.

270
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,065
好了 我很抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just...

271
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,093
我只是不相信那个人
I don't trust that guy.

272
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:04,036
我们应该去找Ethan  他一定愿意帮忙
We should've gone to Ethan.He would've helped.

273
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:06,096
Paulo  看
Paulo, look.

274
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:12,066
另一架飞机
Another plane.

275
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:14,038
看起来已经来这儿很长时间了
Looks like it's been here a while.

276
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,052
- 上去看看  也许有无线电 或者...  - 你疯了吗?
-Go up there.Maybe there's a radio or some...  -Are you insane?

277
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,017
如果我上去那个东西会跌下来的
If I go up there,that thing's gonna fall.

278
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,078
才不会掉下来
You're not gonna fall.

279
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,071
你想让我死吗?
What? You want me to die?

280
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:28,033
我们继续走吧
Come on. Let's keep going.

281
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,070
那是什么?
What is that?

282
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,080
我们一起来
Okay. Let's do it.

283
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,070
我们去瞧瞧
Let's check it out.

284
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,080
我们的包从飞机上落下来
So our carry-on bag fell from the sky,

285
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
打开了一个人造舱门
opened a manhole,

286
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,089
然后自己关上了门?
crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself?

287
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,070
你不想爬上去那飞机...
You don't wanna climb up to a plane...

288
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,090
但现在你想下去这个黑暗的隧道?
but now you want to climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel?

289
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,010
我不这认为
I don't think so.

290
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,000
兄弟  小心点
Hey, man, be careful.

291
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,099
为什么?  他们已经不住这里了
Why? They don't live here anymore.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,040
Sun检查过食品了
So Sun checked the food.

293
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,079
他们和我们吃的一样但没有人生过病
They're eating the same as us,and no one else is sick.

294
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,019
有可能是病毒
Could be a virus.

295
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,040
伙计... 怪物
Dude... Monster.

296
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,059
恶心  他们收集虫子?
Creepy. They collected bugs?

297
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,039
我想这些是Arzt的
I think these were Arzt's.

298
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,050
他收集这里所有种类的爬行昆虫
He collected all kinds of different creepy crawlies

299
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,089
在他...
before he...

300
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,029
爆炸之前
Exploded.

301
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,030
他们也许是朋友
They must've been friends.

302
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,069
Expos
"Expos?"

303
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,009
你刚才说"Expos?"
Did you just say Expos?

304
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,009
是的
Yeah.

305
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,079
什么是"Expos?"
What the hell's Expos??

306
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,049
那是最精彩的电视剧

别扯了
No way.

316
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,029
Lashade就是"眼镜蛇"?
Mr. Lashade was the Cobra?

伙计  "眼镜蛇"是个大坏蛋
Dude, the Cobra's the big bad guy.

他的身份已经被隐藏了4季了

320
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,079
他们有对讲机?
They had a walkie-talkie?

321
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,020
那边岛上的每一个杂种

322

都有一个和这个一样的对讲机

323
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,029
Nikki和Paulo怎么会有的
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

324
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,010
我来告诉你
I'll tell you how.

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,000
他们和"The others"是一伙的
They were working with the others.

326
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,010
谁给你的权利
What gives you the right?

你们要知道  这么做是为了大家好
You have to understand.We thought it was best for everybody.

328

抱歉  你是我妈吗?
I'm sorry.Are you my mother?

329
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,020
因为她知道怎么做才是对的  其他的我说了算
Because she knows what's best for me.Other than that, I decide.

330
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,060

332
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,040

333
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,030
那个箱子上了锁
Look, the case is locked.

334
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,020
钥匙在Jack的脖子上挂着
The key is around Jack's neck,all right?

335
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,050
我保证那绝对安全
I promise you, they're safe.

336
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,080
我已经拿你没办法了
You're all out of control.

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,059
小人称王了
The pigs are walkin'.

338
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,080
小人称王了
The pigs are walking!

339
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,020
你是在哪里找到那个箱子的?
where did you say you found that case?

340
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,010
这是一些水罢了  Paulo
It's just water, Paulo.

341
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,049
别窝囊了 快跳下去吧
Stop being such a wuss and dive in.

342
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,099
为什么是我?
Why me?

343
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,049
是你提醒我
Well, as you had no trouble reminding me,

344
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,020
我和Howie Zuckerman上床的
I slept with Howie Zuckerman,

345
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,010
你至少也得做这件事吧
so the least you could do is go for a swim.

346
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,030
- Kate说过他们在湖底发现的  - 问你个问题
-And Kate said they found the case on the bottom.  -Let me ask you something.

347
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,010
- 什么?  - 如果你不需要我找到那个包
-What?  -If you didn't need me to find that bag,

348
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,020
我们还会在一起吗?
would we still be together?

349
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,090
那个包可值800万美元
That bag is worth $8 million.

350
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,050
潜下去看看吧  Paulo
Just dive in, Paulo.

351
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,040
怎么?
Well?

352
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,019
什么也没有
Nothing.

353
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,080
那下面什么也没有?
There's nothing down there?

354
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,050
除了尸体
Just dead bodies.

355
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,009
他们有对讲机
Okay, so they had a walkie-talkie.

356
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,079
你认为他们和"the others"是一伙的?  怎么可能?
You think they were working with the others? Like, how?

357
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,069
就像Michael
Like Michael.

358
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,089
如果是那样的话  他们为什么要杀Nikki和Paulo呢?
If that's the case,then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?

359
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,009
谁知道他们会做什么?
Who knows why those people do anything?

360
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,010
重要的是...他们也许
What matters is they could be

361
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,099
- 等在那儿要劫持我们  - 我不知道 伙计
-out there right now waiting to get us.  -I don't know, dude.

362
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,089
两个星期前  我见到过"the others"
I was with the others,like, two weeks ago.

363
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,079
他们在岛的另外一边
They're on the total other side of the island.

364
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,030
那是谁把我拖进丛林的?
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

365
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,019
"the others"来到我们的营地
The others came into our camp.

366
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,019
蒙上了我的脸  并把我抓走了
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

367
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,040
如果不是我逃走的话  他们也许会杀了我
And if I hadn't gotten away,they would have killed me.

368
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,019
你们都先待在这里
Look, you all stay here.

369
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,049
让我去查查有没有他们的踪迹
Let me see if I can see any sign of'em.

370
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,029
- 我要来个区域侦察  - 你的枪是哪里来的?
-I'll do a perimeter sweep.  -Where'd you get the gun?

371
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,000
- 从他们中的一个人那里抢来的  - 你准备什么时候告诉我们?
-Got it off one of them.  -And when were you gonna let us know?

372
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,030
我猜是现在
I guess right now.

373
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,070
到底什么是区域侦察?
What exactly is a perimeter sweep?

374
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,009
我们把他们盖上吧?
Shouldn't we cover them up?

375
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,040
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

376
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,040
32天前

377
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,010
好美的夜晚
Nice night.

378
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,020
- 你在做什么?  - 没什么
-What you doing?  -Nothing.

379
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,080
看上去你在挖一个洞
It looks like you're digging a hole.

380
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,070
每个人都有自己的秘密  Paulo
Every man's entitled to his secrets,

381
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,029
我能给你一个建议吗?
but can I give you a piece of advice?

382
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,029
请说吧  John
Please, John.

383
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,070
- 你应该在远一点的地方挖 那会省去许多麻烦的  - 怎么说?
-You'd put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.  -Why's that?

384
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,000
有些东西是埋葬不了的
Things don't stay buried on this island.

385
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,040
海岸正在腐蚀
The beach is eroding.

386
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,029
冬季来临了  到时会有很高的潮水
Winter's coming, high tide.

387
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,089
不管你在藏什么
Whatever it is you're hiding,

388
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,080
去选一个好地方  以便不会被冲走
make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away.

389
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,030
营地见
See you back at camp.

390
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,069
谁开的舱门?
Who left this open?

391
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,050
Tom几天前来过
Tom was down here a couple of days ago.

392
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,000
让他用飞机把这里掩盖起来
Well, have him cover it up with the plane.

393
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,070
那是他吗  Shephard?
That him? Shephard?

394
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,050
是的
Yes.

395
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,010
他好帅
He's cute.

396
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,099
我们为什么要这样做?
Why are we doing this?

397
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,059
Shephard不会答应给你做手术的
Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.

398
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,069
- 不 我能说服他的  - 怎么说?
-No. I can convince him to do it.  -How?

399
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,070
我让他们为我做事的那一套办法
Same way I get anybody to do anything.

400
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,030
我知道他的精神很脆弱
I find out what he's emotionally iested in,

401
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,090
这正好被我利用
and I exploit it.

402
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,069
那又如何
So what,

403
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,070
我们就抓他们3个  还有Ford和Austen吗?
we just grab all three of them,Ford and Austen, too?

404
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,029
不  他们自己会来的
No, they need to come to us.

405
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,099
我们怎么办?
And how do we make that happen?

406
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,020
当然是利用Michael
Michael, of course.

407
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,040
这里没事了吧?  这个地方让我很难受
Are we done here?This place gives me the creeps.

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,049
Desmond
Desmond

409
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,030
你听说了Nikki和Paulo的事吗?

410
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,009
真是悲剧
Aye. Tragic.

411
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,020
那你知道些什么吗?
So... do you know anything?

412
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,039
你什么意思?
How do you mean?

413
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,030
你能...用你的精神力量吗?
Can you... you know,use your psychic powers?

414
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,040
那不是这样的
Doesn't work like that.

415
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,069
我只能看到些片段
I only see flashes.

416
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,069
没有冒犯的意思  但...
No offense, dude, but...

417
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,020
你的超能力...
as far as superpowers go...

418
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:50,020
真是够蹩脚的  还是谢谢你
yours is just kinda lame.Thanks anyway.

419
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,080
我知道早上她和你的兄弟在一起
I do know she was with your mate this morning.

420
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,059
我兄弟?
My mate?

421
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,040
我看见她和你的伙计  Sawyer...
I saw her with your boy Sawyer...

422
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,080
那个死者  Nikki
The dead girl, Nikki.

423
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,019
他说他不认识她
He said he didn't know her.

424
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,090
- 那她为什么朝他大喊大叫?  - 大喊大叫?
-Then why was she yelling at him?  -Yelling?

425
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,039
是的
Aye.

426
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
是Sawyer  今天早上?
At Sawyer, this morning?

427
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
就在她死之前
Right before she died.

428
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,010
Vincent  伙计
Vincent! Dude!

429
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,090
他看见Sawyer和Nikki在吵架?
So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fightin'.

430
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,090
那不能证明什么
That doesn't prove athing.

431
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,039
你自己想想
Look at the facts and ask yourself,

432
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,079
为什么Sawyer对此事那么起劲?
why is Sawyer so gung how about investigating this?

433
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,019
这对他有什么好处?
What's in it for him?

434
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,039
他假装不知道他们的名字
He pretended he didn't know their names,

435
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,079
- 但后来他和Nikki吵了起来  - Sawyer不是杀人犯
-but then he was fighting with Nikki.  -Sawyer's not a murderer.

436
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,009
他穿越这座岛去救Michael
He went all the way across the island to help Michael.

437
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,099
是"the others"干的  我知道他们的所作所为
It is the others.I know what they can do.

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,030
你知道吗?  我去找Desmond
Okay, you know what?I'll go get Desmond.

439
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,050
他会把他看见的告诉你们
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

440
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,010
Sun
Sun?

441
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,080
其实是我
It was me.

442
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,090
什么
What?

443
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,010
是我抓了你
It was me who took you,

444
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
不是"the others"
not the others.

445
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,029
那不是真正的我
I wasn't myself.

446
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,049
那是在Locke打了我以后
After Locke hit me...

447
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,090
在他侮辱了我以后...
After he humiliated me...

448
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,000
Sawyer告诉我如果我帮他拿到枪  他会让他出丑的
Sawyer told me I could get even by helping him steal the guns.

449
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,079
我们只是让这些...
We just made it...

450
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,050
看起来像"the others"
look like... the others.

451
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,010
我并不想伤害你
I didn't mean to hurt you.

452
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,020
抱歉
Sorry.

453
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,089
各位
Hey, everybody.

454

我们正要去珍珠舱

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,070
那里有台电脑  可能会帮助我们找到他们
There's a computer there that might help us find our people.

456
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,050
- 谁愿意一起来?  - 我去
-Anybody wanna come along?  -I'll go.

457
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,050
- 太好了  - 什么?
-Great.  -What?

458
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,010
谁想和我们一起去的  10分钟后在那棵树下集合
Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in ten minutes,

459
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,069
- 别忘了带上水  - 你不是认真的吧
-and bring water.  -You're not serious.

460
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,019
什么?  你一直认为我们参与的事太少
What? You always whine about not being included.

461
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,030
现在这是一个很好的机会
Now's our chance.

462
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,089
那其他的电视是用来干什么的?
what are these other tvs for?

463
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,080
抱歉?
Sorry?

464
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,089
这些电视
All these tvs.

465
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,040
那个人说有6个站...
This guy says that there's six stations...

466
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,030
也许这些电视
So maybe some of these tvs

467
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,010
与其他舱相连接
are connected to the other hatches.

468
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,030
突然我觉得我很笨
Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.

469
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,020
或许有一个是"the other"的老巢
Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds,

470
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,020
看看能不能得到图像
see if we can get another picture.

471
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,060
马桶还能用
The toilet still works.

472
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,009
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

473
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,069
你在说什么?
What the hell you talking about?

474
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,060
把它给我
Give it to me.

475
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,020
它还没上膛呢
It ain't even loaded.

476
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,099
你是怎么区域侦察的?
Then how are you sweeping the perimeter?

477
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,020
别装傻了  伙计
Quit lying, dude.

478
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,030
Desmond今天早上看见你和Nikki在争吵
Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning.

479
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,089
我知道这是怎么一回事了
Oh, I see what this is.

480
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,079
村民们想要他们自己的火把
The villagers have got themselves some torches.

481
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,049
是你杀了他们吗?
Did you kill them?

482
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,050
不
No,

483
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,040
不是我干的
I didn't kill them.

484
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,040
是啊  Nikki早上来找我
Yeah, me and Nikki went at it this morning...

485
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,060
因为她想要把枪
'cause she wanted a gun.

486
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,030
为什么你当时没说呢?
Why didn't you tell us this before?

487
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,079
因为她指甲下有尘土
'cause of the dirt under her nails.

488
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,019
- 什么?  - 她当时在挖东西
-What?  -She was digging,

489
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,029
当我们发现他时  我看见地上有个新的土堆
and when we found him, I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

490
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,019
她在埋什么东西
She was burying somethin',

491
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,000
如果在你死之前
and if you take the time to dig a hole

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,079
还有时间来挖东西的话
right before you die,

493
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,089
那她藏的东西一定很值钱
then what you're hiding's probably pretty damn good.

494
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,080
那是什么?  她藏了什么?
So what was it?What did she hide?

495
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,050
都拿走吧
Go ahead. Take 'em.

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,040
因为发生在他们身上的一切
'cause whatever happened to those two,

497
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,000
和我没有一点关系
I had nothing to do with it.

498
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,010
12小时之前

499
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,040
你知道感恩节已经过了两个星期了吗?
Did you know thanksgiving was two weeks ago?

500
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,030
我们错过了  Paulo
We missed it, Paulo,

501
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,009
就像我们错过了一切
just like we're gonna miss everything.

502
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,019
他们会找到我们的
They're going to find us.

503
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,030
我们会得救的  相信我
We'll get rescued.You'll see.

504
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:46,050
这突如其来的乐观主义是从哪里来的?
Okay, where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?

505
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,039
我不知道  我猜...
I don't know. I guess...

506
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,080
是你看待事物的角度...
It's how you look at things...

507
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,039
比如说那个包
Like the bag.

508
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,099
也许找不到它对我们都好
I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.

509
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,089
怎么说?
How do you figure that?

510
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,000
看它做的好事
Look what it did.

511
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,020
这让我们不和
It might have... torn us apart.

512
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,030
是啊
Yeah.

513
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,059
待在这
Wait here.

514
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,000
我去弄点早餐
I'm gonna get us some breakfast.

515
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,000
好吧
Okay,

516
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,069
我知道你有那个
I know you have them.

517
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,069
给我把枪
Give me a gun.

518
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,050
已经没有了  A小队全拿走了
I don't have the guns. A-team took'em all.

519
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,049
除了你自己的那把
Right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.

520
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,039
我有也不会给你的
Even if I had a gun, I wouldn't give it to you.

521
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,059
考虑到你这么生气
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

522
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,050
我觉得不会有好事发生
I got a feeling no good would come of it.

523
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,060
Sawyer  把枪给我
Sawyer, give me a gun.

524
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,040
我有个更好的主意
I got a better idea, sister.

525
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,000
跳下大海去
How about you go stick your head

526
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,090
- 让自己冷静一下?  - 谢谢你什么也没给我
-in the ocean and cool yourself off?  -Thanks for nothin'.

527
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,040
你到底是谁?
And who the hell are you?

528
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,070
谢谢你什么也没给我
Thanks for nothin'.

529
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,000
Charlie告诉我那是你的主意...
Charlie told me it was your idea...

530
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,000
劫持我
to kidnap me.

531
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,019
你会告诉Jin吗?
You gonna tell Jin?

532
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,010
不
No.

533
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,019
为什么不?
Why not?

534
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,050
因为如果这样我们又要多一具尸体了
Because then we'd have to dig another grave.

535
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,029
你为什么要给我?
Why are you giving me these?

536
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,010
因为这些在这里毫无价值
Because they're worthless here.

537
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,040
我以为我会...
See, I thought I was gonna get out of this without a...

538
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,040
Nikki和Paulo...
Nikki and Paulo...

539
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
我们不怎么很熟
I guess we didn't really know you very well,

540
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,080
现在你们为了钻石而自相惨杀
and it appears you killed each other for diamonds.

541
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,019
但我知道你们也有好的一面
But I know there are good parts to you, too.

542
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,060
你们一直对我很好
You were always nice to me,

543
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,090
你们是营地的一员
and you were a member of the camp.

544
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,040
还有...
And...

545
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,010
我真的很喜欢"Expos"
I really loved Expos?

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,039
好吧
Okay, then.

547
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,000
- 再见了  - 等等
-Goodbye.  -Wait.

548
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,060
安息吧  Nikki和Paulo
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

549
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,030
快点Nikki  告诉我吧
Come on, Nikki, just tell me.

550
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,039
这是一个惊喜
It's a surprise.

551
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,060
我们快到了
We're almost there.

552
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,070
准备好了吗?
Okay, ready?

553
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,009
是的
Yeah

554
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,080
我找到钻石了  Paulo
I found the diamonds.

555
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,020
什么?  在哪儿?
What? Where?

556
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,050
就在这里
Right here.

557
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,000
把他们给我
Give them to me.

558
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,019
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

559
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,040
我在说什么?
What am I talking about?

560
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,019
这是什么?
What's this?

561
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,099
你的尼古丁口香糖?
Your nicotine gum?

562
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,040
你不想再找那个包
You wanted to stop looking for the bag

563
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,029
是因为你已经找到了
because you'd already found it.

564
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,070
我知道他们在你这里  Paulo  他们在哪里?!
I know you have them, Paulo, so where are they?

565
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,010
冷静一点好吗?
Calm down, okay?

566
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,010
这该死的是什么?
What the hell is that?

567
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,040
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

568
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,049
你记得Arzt博士的朋友
You remember Dr. Arzt's friend.

569
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,090
它咬你了吗?
Did it bite you?

570
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,049
那很疼吧?
Does it hurt?

571
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,000
他告诉我为什么他们叫它"美杜莎蜘蛛"
He told me why they call it "the medusa spider."

572
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,090
想知道为什么吗?
Wanna know why?

573
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,050
你干了什么?
What did you do?

574
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,019
因为看了美杜莎的人就会变成石头
Because one look from medusa would turn anyone to stone,

575
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,049
就像它咬你一口能让你瘫痪...
just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you...

576
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,080
大概是8个小时
For... oh, about eight hours.

577
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,090
这不会致命
It won't kill you.

578
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,000
只会让你的心跳减慢
It'll just...slow your heart rate down to the point

579
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,070
这个连医生也没办法...
where even a doctor would have a hard time...

580
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,000
听到你的心还在跳
hearing it beat.

581
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,070
你一动一不能动
You won't be able to move a muscle,

582
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:20,059
我就能在你身上做一切肮脏的事
so I'll be able to do all sorts of nasty things to you.

583
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,060
自从它咬了你之后
And since it bit you on your neck,

584
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,090
效果还真是快啊
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

585
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,080
我猜钻石就在你身上
I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you.

586
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,040
也许在鞋子里?
In a shoe, maybe?

587
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,050
我想我知道了
I think I know where.

588
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,060
狗娘养的东西
Son of a bitch.

589
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,009
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,000
你被抓到了  当然要抱歉
You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.

591
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,009
我... 很害怕...
I was... afraid...

592
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,030
失去你
of losing you.

593
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,090
如果你找到了那些钻石...
If you found the diamonds...

594
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,080
你就再也不需要我了
you wouldn't need me anymore.

595
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,050
该死的!
Damn it!

596
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,030
你还好吗?
You okay?

597
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,010
发生了什么事?
Hey, what happened?

598
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,010
我瘫痪了
I'm paralyzed.
