我知道 我们从没坐下来谈过话
I know you and I haven't had time to talk,

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,580
但我想知道 James是否把我在峭壁那儿
but I was wondering if James had filled you in

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,680
给他看的东西 告诉了你
on what I showed him at the cliffs.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,420
你指的是 墙上刻满名字的那个洞穴

很多名字 现在都被划掉了

"Kwon"就是其中之一
"Kwon" is one of them.

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,990
这名字是指我 还是Sun?
Does that mean me or Sun?

38
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,430
呃 Jin 我也不确定
Well, Jin, I'm not sure.

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,240
但这表明
But what it does mean

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,990
我们能离开该岛的唯一方式
is that the only way we can leave the island

41
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,070
就是将所有名字没被划去的人
is if all the names that haven't been crossed off

42

聚集起来

44
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,810
你把腿养好就行
You just take care of that leg.

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,660
这事交给我来办
I'm workin' on it.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,830
换言之 如果您想要回这笔钱

就得把相关文书材料补充完整

而且他对我们接下来该干嘛 一无所知

要不要进来再谈?

150
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,240

我不想站在门口说话

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,550

现在都11点半了

152
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,740

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,540

这人是我爸的手下

156
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,670

没什么大不了的

157
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,690

你会在乎什么呢?

158
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,940

你不过是来这里购物的

159
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,200

你就是这么看我的?

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,150

觉得我就是来购物的?

161
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,030

不是...

162
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,230

或许你该告诉我 把扣子扣紧...

163
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,060

就像你在飞机上做的那样 如何?

164
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,800

那飞机到处都是人...

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,150

我不知道有谁在看我们

166
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,290

没人会看我们的

167
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,470

言归正传... 你想要我把扣子扣起来吗?

168
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,070

不想

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,760

那么...

170
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,850

这颗呢?

171
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,560

别扣

172
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,630

这颗呢?

173
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,960

别扣...

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,710

这颗千万别扣...

175
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,270
Sun啊
Sun.

176
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,690
抱歉 我不想吓到你的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

177
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,620
心情不好吗?
Bad day?

178
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,940
你到这来干嘛?
What are you doing here?

179
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,590
我找到你丈夫了
I found your husband.

180
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,820
什么?
What?

181
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,190
我答应过你 要让你们夫妻团聚的
I promised you I would reunite you two.

182
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,060
只不过比预想中 多花了点儿时间
Took me a little longer than I thought it would.

183
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,840
他和我的人 在小岛另一头的营地
But he's with my people back at my camp across the island.

184
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,590
我现在就可以带你去找他
I can take you to him right now.

185
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,140
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

186
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,420
你把寺庙里的人都杀了
You killed those people at the temple.

187
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,940
那些人是非不分
Those people were confused.

188
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,780
他们受骗了
They were lied to.

189
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,040
我也不想伤害他们
I didn't want to hurt them.

190
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,830
他们本来可以选择跟我一起走的
Any one of them could've chosen to come with me.

191
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,540
现在 Sun 我把这个机会留给你
And I'm giving you that choice, Sun, right now.

192
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,050
我不会强迫你做任何事
I would never make you do anything against your will.

193
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,720
我是在请求你
I'm asking you.

194
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,290
拜托
Please.

195
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,010
跟我走吧
Come with me.

196
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,710
Jin在等你呢
Jin is waiting.

197
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,980
Sun啊!
Sun!

198
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,070
Sun 等等!
Sun, wait!

199
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360

我有个主意...

200
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,100

什么主意?

201
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,710

我们逃跑吧

202
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,140

什么?

203
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,780

我说真的

204
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,590

我们逃跑吧

205
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,590

怎么跑啊?

206
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,480

我存了笔钱

207
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,130

你早就计划好了?

208
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,280

生气了?

209
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,810

没有...

210
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,510

但你说的... 不能这么做

211
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,410

你想不想和我在一起?

212
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,110

当然想 我爱你

213
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440

那好

214
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,010

有件事你得知道...

215
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,050

会是谁?

216
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,250

不知道

217
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,160

我挂标牌了啊...

218
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,210

就说你在睡觉

219
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,750
嗨 Paik小姐
Ms. Paik. Hi.

220
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,700

是你父亲的朋友
I'm a friend of your father's.

222
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,810
我想你有东西给我 对吗?
I believe you've got something for me. Hmm?

223
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,510
Sun啊?
Sun?

224
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,370
Sun 听得见吗?
Sun, can you hear me?

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,950
怎么了?
What happened?

226
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,760
还好吧?
You all right?

227
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,280

他在哪儿?

228
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
你说什么?
I'm sorry, what?

229
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,670

他刚才追着我...

230
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,250

他在这儿... 我看到了 他...

231
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,020
Sun 慢慢说 用英语告诉我怎么了
Sun, slow dowm. Tell me what happened in English.

232
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,320
是谁干的?
Who did this to you?

233
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,640
是Locke
Locke.

234
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,850
Sayid啊
Sayid.

235
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,570
Sayid啊
Sayid.

236
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,280
嘿
Hey.

237
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,860
怎么了?
What happened?

238
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,570
我们被袭击了
We were attacked.

239
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,440
被谁?
By whom?

240
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,670
不知道
I don't know.

241
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,580
Jin人呢?
Where is Jin?

242
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,140
嘿!
Hey!

243
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,790
嘿!
Hey!

244
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,680
很奇怪吧?
Wow, that was weird, huh?

245
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,580
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

246
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,820
23室
It's called Room 23.

247
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,490
达摩组织当初在这儿
The Dharma Initiative

248
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,900
做关于潜意识信息的实验
was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here.

249
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,440
你很了解达摩组织
But you know all about the Dharma Initiative,

250
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
是吗 Kwon先生?
don't you, Mr. Kwon?

251
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,410
- 为什么带我来这儿?  - 放心 你很安全
- Why did you bring me here?  - Relax. You're safe.

252
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,140
我要离开
I'm leaving.

253
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,620
对不起了
Sorry.

254
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,720
我们费了很大劲儿
But we went to a lot of trouble

255
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,310
才把你从那个岛带过来
getting you here off of the other island.

256
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,460
我不能让你离开
And I can't let you leave.

257
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,100
你们要我干什么?
What do you want from me?

258
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,210
这些地图... 是达摩成员用来
These are grid maps that... that the Dharma people used

259
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,440
标识电磁区的
to identify pockets of electromagnetism.

260
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,700
标这些的人 才能真的帮我离开这儿
Whoever signed these could really help me out.

261
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,910
呃 我知道... 我知道这些字迹很潦草
Uh, I know... I know the writing's difficult to read,

262
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,850
但... 但看着能确定是 "Jin-soo Kwon"
but... but it sure looks like it says, "Jin-soo Kwon."

263
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,440
所以...
So...

264
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,640
是你 对吗?
Is it you or isn't it?

265
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,830
你想知道答案?
You want answers to your questions?

266
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,230
那叫你们老大过来
Then get me your boss.

267
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,220
我要和Charles Widmore谈
I want to talk with Charles Widmore.

268
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,560
那么 你很走运...
Well, then you're in luck...

269
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Kwon先生 他也想和你谈
Mr. Kwon, because he'd like to talk to you, too.

270
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,810
你水性好吗?
You a good swimmer?

271
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,790
- 挺好  - 用塑料包好
- Good enough.  - Wrap this in plastic.

272
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,120
别沾水 我们还得划船
You don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger.

273
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,880
Claire 怎么了?
Something wrong, Claire?

274
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,610
嗯...
Um...

275
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,190
关于墙上的名字...
What... what you said to Jin...

276
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,490
你跟Jin说的那些事...
about the names on the wall...

277
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,240
你告诉他 需要聚集所有人 才能离开岛
You told him you needed them all to get off the island.

278
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,020
是的
Yes, I did.

279
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,010
那... 墙上有我的名字吗?
Was, uh... was my name on the wall?

280
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,670
没有
No.

281
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,110
那么我上不上飞机 都无关紧要了
Well, then it doesn't matter if I get on that plane, then.

282
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,130
- 我是说 你不需要我了  - 不 Claire 我需要你
- I mean, you don't need me.  - Oh, that's not true, Claire. I need you.

283
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,900
飞机上的位置 足够把我们所有人运走
And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us.

284
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,240
那么 回到家后 Aron不认识我
Well, when we go home, Aron's not gonna know me.

285
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,670
和儿子形同陌路 他以为Kate才是他妈妈
Stranger to my own son. He thinks Kate's his mother.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,520
墙上有她的名字吗?
Is her name on the wall?

287
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
没有 Claire 以后
No, Claire, it isn't,

288
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,120
都没有
not anymore.

289
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,960
但我需要Kate
But I need Kate.

290
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,630
为什么?
Why?

291
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,460
因为我... 有三个人不愿意离开这座岛
Because I'm... three people shy of getting off this island,

292
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,760
Kate能帮我让他们上飞机
and Kate can help me get these people on that plane.

293
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,050
一旦她完成使命...
But once she does...

294
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,620
那么该发生的事 就会发生
then whatever happens, happens.

295
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,090
这些枪要用来干什么?
What's up with the guns?

296
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,060
你们去哪儿?
You two going somewhere?

297
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,490
我们坐船去对面的岛
We're taking a boat ride over to the other island.

298
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,940
你还犯得着坐船?
What do you need a boat for?

299
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,950
你不是能化成黑烟 飞过去吗?
Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water?

300
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,280
你觉得我要是可以的话 还会待在这儿吗?
Do you think if I could do that, I would still be on this island?

301
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,410
是啊 那样太荒唐了
No, 'cause that'd be ridiculous.

302
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,760
那么 你们到底去干什么?
What the hell you going over there for, anyway?

303
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,660
我以为你想躲开Charlie Widmore
I thought you were trying to avoid Charlie Widmore.

304
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,850
James 他们带走了我们的人
They took one of our people, James.

305
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,620
我要去救他回来
So I'm going to get 'em back.

306
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,200
哦 给我的?
Oh, it's for me?

307
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,220
真漂亮
Uh, this is really nice.

308
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,050
你的保镖该给我些钱
Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money.

309
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,220
Kwon先生在哪儿?
Where's Mr. Kwon?

310
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,240
不懂英语
No English.

311
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,170
嗯?
Hmm?

312
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,480
好 请坐
All right, uh, sit down.

313
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,710
我搜过他房间 他不在
I checked his room. He's not there.

314
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,810
看下浴室
Check the bathroom.

315
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,050
好了 出来吧
Come on. Let's go.

316
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,680
Kwon先生 为什么不出来和我们谈谈啊?
Mr. Kwon, why don't you come and join us?

317
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,080
听着 谢谢你们的表 懂吗?
Look, thank you for the watch, okay?

318
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,940
但还应该给我
But you're also supposed to give me

319
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,720
装钱的信封... 内有2万5千美元
envelope with money in it... $25,000.

320
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,980
懂吗?
Yeah?

321
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,190

怎么办?

322
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,810

我们匀出点儿钱 给他们吧

323
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520

你想把我们的钱给他?

324
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,580
住口
Stop that.

325
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,740
感觉就像该死的"哥斯拉"电影场景
I feel like I'm in a damn "Godzilla" movie.

326
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,880
那家伙叫什么? 那个...
What's that guy's name? The, um, the Russian guy...

327
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,150
貌似会说九国语言的俄国佬
speaks, like, nine different languages.

328
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,500
Danny的朋友
Uh, uh, Danny's friend.

329
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,150
- Mikhail  - Mikhail 他会说韩语吗?

330
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,410
- 我想会吧  - 好 把他找来
- I think so.  - Okay, go get him.

331
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,370
现在穿好衣服
Now put some clothes on.

332
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,190

那些钱被海关扣押了 但我有钱

333
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,280
她说 她爸爸给他们的钱 被海关扣押了
She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs.

334
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,250
这不关我的事
Mm, that's not my problem.

335
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,550

我们一起去银行 我把钱取给你们

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,170
她想让你允许他们去银行
She wants you to let them please go to the bank.

337
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,280
然后他们会把钱取给你
They will get it for you.

338
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,780
你带她去银行
You take her to the bank.

339
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,900
我把这位公子哥儿 带回饭店
I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant.

340
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,910
然后 我们在那里碰面
And then we'll meet there.

341
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,220

他会和Jin一起回饭店

342
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,120

拜托 请你千万不要把我和Sun的事情 告诉Paik先生

343
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440

拜托了

344
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,600
他刚才说什么呢?
What's he whining about?

345
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,680
他希望你能够答应他 不把他俩苟且的事情
He wants you to promise that you won't tell her father

346
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,340
告诉她爸
that they are involved.

347
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
喔 你不用为这个担心
Oh, hey, don't worry about that.

348
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
懂吗? 我会为你守口如瓶的 好吧?
Okay? Your secret is safe with me. Okay?

349
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,680
只要你把钱取给我
Just bring me the money,

350
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,160
我们就可以开开心心地 过各自的生活了 好吧?
and then we can all live happily ever after, right?

351
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,340
什么?
What?

352
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,700
你误会我四次了 当时我正在采芒果
Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes,

353
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,660
我发现她的时候 她已经昏过去了
and she was already unconscious when I found her.

354
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,280
- 你为什么就不相信我?  - 因为你越描越黑
- Why won't you believe me?  - Because you're speaking.

355
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,840
你头上肿起了个大包
You got a pretty decent-sized bump.

356
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,050
或许会有轻微的脑震荡
Might be a slight concussion.

357
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,370
你可以听懂我正在说什么
You can understand what I'm saying,

358
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,890
但是你现在仅仅只会说韩语了
but you can only speak Korean.

359
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,210

是这样的

360
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,640
她撞到了脑袋 导致她忘记了如何说英语?
She hits her head and forgets English?

361
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,630
这能叫人相信吗?
Are we supposed buy that?

362
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,150
去问问那个能和亡灵对话的人吧
Asked the man who communes with the dead.

363
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,330
这可能是失语症
It might be aphasia.

364
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,170
这是由精神创伤引起的
It's, um, a condition that's caused by trauma

365
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,810
继而影响到了你大脑的语言中枢
and affects the language center of your brain.

366
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,530
但是通常来讲 这种失语状态都是暂时的
But it's usually temporary.

367
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,380
Sun呀
Sun.

368
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,090
你会好起来的
You're gonna be okay.

369
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,560
你在笑什么呢?
What are you smiling about?

370
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,810
整理好行囊 我们要出发了
Pack your bags. We are leaving.

371
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,950
不许动!
Don't move!

372
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,540
把双手举起来!
Let me see your hands!

373
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,120
冷静 兄弟 我是为和平而来
Easy, friend. I come in peace.

374
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,150
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

375
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,420
你是Charles Widmore
Charles Widmore.

376
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,610
那你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?

377
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,850
很显然 你不是John Locke
Obviously, you're not John Locke.

378
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,690
我还知道你是个充满奇异色彩的人
Everything else I know is a combination of myth,

379
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,220
鬼怪一般 夜间在丛林里呼啸来去
ghost stories and jungle noises in the night.

380
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,660
通过这些...路标塔 我觉得你知我甚深
I think you know more than that, judging by these... pylons

381
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
你为什么要来这里?
Why did you come here?

382
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,600
你掳走了我的人... Jin Kwon
You took one of my people... Jin Kwon.

383
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,970
我不知道你在瞎扯些什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

384
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,960
有位智者曾经说过 这个岛上将会爆发战争
A wise man once said that war was coming to this island.

385
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,880
我想 战争已经到来了
I think it just got here.

386
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,730
我们到底要去哪里 Richard?
Where exactly are we going, Richard?

387
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,060
- Locke在哪里?  - 什么?
- Where's Locke?  - What?

388
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,040
- 你说 他曾经来拉拢你们 他有提过他在哪里吗?  - 九头蛇岛
- You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be?  - Hydra Island.

389
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,560
就是你飞机降落的地方
Which is exactly where you landed the plane.

390
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,470
- 你飞回了这里 对吗?  - 是的
- That you flew back here, right?  - That's right.

391
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,630
这个... 人想要离开这个岛
This... man wants to leave the island,

392
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,080
只有那架飞机可以做到
and that plane is the only way can do it.

393
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,030
你知道我们该去往哪里吗?
You wanna know where we're going?

394
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,600
- 我们得去阻止他  - 这是你的错吧?
- We're gonna stop him.  - This is your fault, isn't it?

395
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,840
- 算是吧  - 我们如何去阻止他登机?
- Sort of.  - How are you gonna stop him from getting on that plane?

396
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,230
我们只能把飞机毁了
We have to destroy it.

397
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,630

什么?

398
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,010

你要把飞机毁了?

399
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,220

那我们怎么离开这个岛呢?

400
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,760
为什么她不说英语了?
Why isn't she speaking English?

401
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,270
她在逃离Locke的时候 撞到了自己的脑袋
She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke.

402
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,560
他又回来了?
He came back here?

403
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,070
什么... 他想要什么?
What... what did he want?

404
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,050
他和你说过什么? 你... 可以听懂我在说什么吗?
What did he say to you? You... you understand me?

405
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:26,940

当然能

406
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,420

我能听懂 你个蠢货...

407
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,810

但是你想要我们去帮你 毁掉我们离开这个岛的唯一希望...

408
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,670

你真是疯了!

409
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200

我是来这儿找丈夫的...

410
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,350

然后我可以和他一起回家 我可没有想来拯救世界!

411
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,660

她说我很重要

412
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,760

如果那是真的 说明你需要我!

413
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,610

那么请你"记住"...

414
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,150

我哪里都不会去!

415
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,370
看来她不想去
I don't think she wants to come.

416
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,340

有什么问题吗?

417
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,070
Paik女士想知道 是否出了差错
Ms. Paik would like to know if there is a problem.

418
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,630
很抱歉 这里显示你的账户已经关闭了
I'm sorry. I'm showing that your account was closed.

419
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,470
存款余额为零
The balance is zero.

420
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,680

她说你的账户已经关闭了

421
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,760

这是不可能的

422
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,110

只有我知道这个账户

423
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,080
她想知道 是谁把账户关掉的呢?
If she may ask, who closed the account, please?

424
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,690
看来是... 她父亲做的
Looks like... her father.

425
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,320
Woo-Jung Paik先生曾经访问过这个账户
Mr. Woo-Jung Paik had access.

426
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,620
他把所有的钱 都转汇到他在我们首尔总行
The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts

427
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,450
的其它账户里去了
at our main branch in Seoul.

428
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,830

是你父亲关闭的账户

429
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,690

什么... 他为什么要那么做?

430
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,050

你觉得呢?

431
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,750

警告: 此门勿开

432
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,780
- 啊!  - 给我进来
- Uhh!  - Get in here.

433
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,120
进来 快点 进来
Let's get in. Come on. Get in.

434
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,540
怎么了?
What's going on?

435
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,770
我把他的头在门上碰了下
I bumped his head on the door.

436
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,290
拜托 Omar 你要小心一点呀
Oh, come on, Omar. You gotta be more careful than that.

437
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,930
这里交给我了
I got this.

438
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,780
你去把那个阿拉伯人抓进来
You go get the Arab guy.

439
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,420
注意点 我也是阿拉伯人
Hey. I'm an Arab.

440
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,970
赶紧去把他带过来
Just go pick him up.

441
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,970
对不起 把你的头碰到了
Sorry about that.

442
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,900
Omar很忠诚 但他总是粗手粗脚
Omar is loyal, but he lacks attention to detail.

443
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,310
你完全不明白
You don't really understand

444
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,530
我在跟你讲什么 对吧? 什么都听不懂?
a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothing?

445
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,230
好吧 别动 明白吗?
All right. Just hold still, ok?

446
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,820
我准备把你绑在这儿
I'm gonna strap you here.

447
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,060
万一你听懂了自己身上即将发生的事
Just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you,

448
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,720
我可不能让你发疯
I can't have you freaking out.

449
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,260
我想你还不知道
I don't think you realize

450
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,100
Paik先生在知道 你对他的宝贝女儿做过些什么后
how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out

451
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,900
有多生气
that you were doing his little girl.

452
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,180
你知道那2万5千美金
Well, you know that 25 grand

453
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,510
是他让你转交的 对吧?
that you were supposed to deliver?

454
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,390
那是我揍你的劳务费
That was my fee for popping you.

455
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,960
据我所知
From what I hear, you know,

456
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,310
所有为Paik工作的人 都知道一条潜规则...
anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule...

457
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,390
别碰老板的女儿
hands off the boss's daughter.

458
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,470
但是你... 你无法抵抗她的魅力 对吧?
But you... you couldn't resist her, could you?

459
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,270
人总是无法抗拒欲望的
The heart wants what the heart wants.

460
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,550
谢谢你
Thank you.

461
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,230
对不起
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,320
某些情侣注定无法永结连理的
Some people just aren't meant to be together.

463
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,210
你到底在想什么?
What the hell were you thinking?

464
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,250
对不起 我知道 我们都很惶恐
I'm sorry. I know. I know we panicked.

465
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,670
这根本就不应该发生
This was not supposed to happen for days.

466
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,400
- 我们是有行程安排的  - 听我说 他要离开营地
- We had a timetable.  - See, he was leaving their camp.

467
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,550
那你就应该让他走
Well, you should have let him leave

468
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,650
然后把他带到丛林里
and take him in the jungle.

469
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,450
哦 也许你应该找个雇佣兵来指挥
Well, maybe you should put a mercenary in charge

470
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,130
而不是找一位地球物理学家
instead of a geophysicist.

471
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,270
过去的就算了
What's done is done.

472
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,060
我需要你把潜水艇里的包裹弄出来
I need you to get the package from the submarine

473
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,440
然后拿到医务室去
and take it to the infirmary.

474
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,830
你能帮我这个忙吗 拜托了 Zoe?
Can you do that for me, please, Zoe?

475
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,720
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

476
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,230
Kwon先生
Mr. Kwon.

477
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,790
关于我们对你做的那些事
My deepest apologies for everything

478
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,270
我深表歉意 我叫...
that's been done to you. My name is...

479
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,950
我知道你是谁 你为什么把我带到这儿来?
I know who you are. Why did you bring me here?

480
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,190
我们搜过那架Ajira航空公司的飞机 发现了你妻子的行李箱
We searched the Ajira plane, discovered your wife's luggage

481
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,500
在里面找到了这个
and found this inside.

482
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,100
我想你可能会想要拿走
I thought you might want to have it.

483
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,800
继续
Go ahead.

484
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,700
打开它
Turn it on.

485
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,170
她的名字是Ji Yeon
Her name is Ji Yeon.

486
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,810
你的女儿
Your daughter.

487
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,300
我知道 你和她素未谋面
I understand you've never seen her before.

488
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,180
我也有个女儿
I have a daughter, too.

489
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,360
我知道骨肉相离是什么滋味
I know what it's like to be kept apart.

490
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,270
我明白 你想要的
I understand the one thing you want

491
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,410
是和你的妻儿团聚
is to be reunited with your wife and daughter.

492
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,090
但这些只能是幻影
But it would be short-lived

493
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,840
如果那个... 东西
if that... thing

494
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,950
打扮成John Locke的那个东西 一旦离开这座岛
masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island,

495
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,790
你的妻子 你的女儿 我的女儿...
your wife, your daughter, my daughter...

496
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,700
我们认识的 还有爱着的所有人...
everyone we know and love...

497
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,800
就会不复存在
would simply cease to be.

498
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,130
我来 是为了确保这事不会发生
I came here to make sure that doesn't happen.

499
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,080
怎么做?
How?

500
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,380
跟我来
Come with me.

501
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,520
我想 是时候让你看看包裹了
Think it's time for you to see the package.

502
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,630
那包裹是什么东西?
What package?

503
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,800
那不是样"东西"
It's not a "what."

504
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,990
是个"人"
It's a "who."

505
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,990

警告: 此门勿开

506
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,880

别杀我

507
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,350

求求你 放我走吧!

508
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,940
你是谁?
Who are you?

509
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,100
不懂英语
No English.

510
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,590
我不知道你为什么会在这儿 我也不在乎
I don't know why you're here, and I don't really care.

511
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,280
别走!
No!

512
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,870
放了我
Free.

513
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,320
放了我!
Free!

514
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,940
放了我
Free.

515
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,620
祝你好运
Good luck.

516
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,890
Martin啊
Martin

517
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,330
喂 Martin?
Martin?

518
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,970
这是谁干的?
Who did this to you?

519
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,860
看后面 你这个白痴
Look behind you, you idiot.

520
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,360

把枪放下!

521
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,430

别冲动

522
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,400

没事的

523
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,500

这些是谁干的?

524
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,930

我说把枪放下

525
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,720

快!

526
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,780

Sun 站远点

527
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,070

听见我说的话了吗?

528
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,540

扔掉枪 不然我就杀了你!

529
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,370

不 我想你不会...

530
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,750

因为 如果这些是你干的?

531
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,300

你早就开枪把我干掉了

532
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,500

Sun啊!

533
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,460

天啊! 天啊!

534
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,120

我带你去找人!

535
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,670

你不会有事的...

536
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,080

我怀孕了...

537
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,340
我给你带了点东西
I brought you a couple of things.

538
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,440
我想起了 曾负责过的一个病人
I was thinking about a patient that I had

539
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,820
当时我还在实习期
during my residency.

540
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,840
他遭遇车祸 头部撞伤
Car crash, banged his head.

541
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,270
醒来后 他就不能说话了
When he woke up, he couldn't talk.

542
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,440
那人当时很沮丧 我是说...
The guy was frustrated. I mean...

543
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,440
谁会不沮丧呢?
who wouldn't be?

544
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,490
然后一名护士说 "他不能说话...
And then one of the nurses said, "Just because he can't speak...

545
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,130
不代表他不能写字呀"
doesn't mean that he can't write."

546
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,500
你愿意试试吗?
Think you could give it a try?

547
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,200

愿意

548
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,070
交流起来 会比以前慢一点
It'll take a little longer to get your point across,

549
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
但至少你又能"说话"了
but at least you have your voice back.

550
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,960
我去过你的菜园 去看他还在不在
I went back out to your garden to see if he was there.

551
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,690
他不在 不过...
He wasn't, but...

552
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,630
后来我发现了这个
then I found this.

553
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,580
真是个顽强的西红柿
That's one stubborn tomato.

554
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,040
我猜没人告诉它 它本该枯死了的
Guess no one told it it was supposed to die.

555
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,540

对不起

556
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,820
别在意
Don't worry about it.

557
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,010
你不是第一个告诉我 让我别理你的人
You're not the first person to tell me to leave them alone.

558
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,160
Locke... 他跟你说什么了?
Locke... What did he say to you?

559
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,810

他说 Jin在他手上

560
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,120
你为什么不跟他走?
Why didn't you go with him?

561
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,370

我不信任他

562
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,990
你信任我吗?
Do you trust me?

563
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,370
Sun啊...
Sun...

564
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
跟我们走 我会帮你找到Jin的
Come with us, and I'll help you find Jin.

565
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,100
我会帮你找到他 然后让你俩都能登机
I'll help you find him, and I'll get you both on that plane

566
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,360
远离这座小岛 有多远 就走多远
and as far away from this island as you can get.

567
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,170
我保证
I promise.

568
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,210
你在想什么?
Where'd you go?

569
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,820
什么?
What?

570
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,290
你好像有点走神
Looked like your brain took a little stroll.

571
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,140
你为什么不担心 James?
Why aren't you worried, James?

572
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,630
我在担心
I am worried.

573
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,620
只不过 我成功地装出了不担心的样子
Just really good at pretending I ain't.

574
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,260
但我有种感觉 这一切快结束了
But I got a feeling this is almost over.

575
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,020
只要Locke带着Sayid划船到了对岸
'Cause if Locke rode over there on the boat with Sayid,

576
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,700
然后Charlie Widmore一拳把他打到水里 一切就结束了
then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water.

577
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,490
那如果他没有呢?
And what if he didn't?

578
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,180
哦 那我们就群策群力...
Well, then we're screwed six ways from sun...

579
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,020
哦 该死
Oh, hell.

580
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,580
就他一个人
He's alone.

581
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,180
我以为你过去找Jin了
Thought you went over there to find Jin.

582
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,210
他们说他不在那儿
They said they didn't have him.

583
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,560
- 你就信了  - 没有
- And you believed that.  - No.

584
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,530
Sayid在哪儿? 他也丢了?
Where's Sayid? Did you lose him, too?

585
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:13,970
James 你在那边的时候
When you over there, James,

586
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,250
你提到Widmore派人
You mentioned that Widmore had someone

587
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,750
把守着潜水艇里的一个房间...
guarding a room on his submarine...

588
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,210
里面是些他不想让你看到的东西
guarding something that he didn't want you to see.

589
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,360
对 然后?
Yeah, so?

590
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,450
我不喜欢秘密
I don't like secrets.

591
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,030
好了
All right.

592
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,350
- 好  - 这家伙几乎站不起来
- Okay.  - The guy can hardly stand.

593
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,960
噢 你还想怎么样?
Well, what do you expect?

594
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,540
哦!
Oh!

595
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,650
你给他用了多少?
How much did you give him?

596
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,060
显然 我给他用多了
Obviously, I gave him too much,

597
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,970
但这一路 我们就得让他昏着 我又不是护士
but we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse.

598
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,680
- 快来 把他架起来  - 我们走吧 Hume先生

- Come on. Get him up.  - Let's go, Mr. Hume.
