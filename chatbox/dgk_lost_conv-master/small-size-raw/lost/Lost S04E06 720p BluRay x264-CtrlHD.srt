Ben在监狱里  怎么会知道他们的行踪

没关系  这不是你的错

相信我  没人期待你一夜之间就能搞定
Believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnight.

110

有人陪你聊聊吗  有没有朋友也在这

Harper讨厌我
Harper hates me.

113

00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,095
他们抓到了Miles?
So they have Miles?

156
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,033
是的  不过他没事
Yeah, but he's fine.

157
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,030
他们对他不错
They... they're treating him fine.

158
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:06,098
我还以为你们俩正和Jack在沙滩上
I thought you two are with jack at the beach.

159
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:10,019
你们在这里做什么?
What are you gs doing out here?

160
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:15,000
Jack正想和货船上的sayid和desmond通话
Jackas trying to communicate With sayid and desmond on the freighter,

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,088
但卫星电话电池耗尽了
But their sat phone ran out of juice.

162
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,002
死机了
It's totally dead.

163
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,019
我们没法和货船联系了
There's no way we can call the boat.

164
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,097
所以我们就自告奋勇几个
So we volunteered to get the spare batteries

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,016
去找直升机上仍下来的旅行包  里面有备用电池
Out of the packs that we threw out the chopper.

166
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,091
旅行包不是从飞机上仍下来了吗
So... if you threw your pack from the chopper,

167
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,030
这是什么?
What's that?

168
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,029
这个  嗯
This? uh...

169
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:37,039
这是
It's...

170
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,080
别人那借来的
Just borrowed is.

171
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,058
可以看下吗
Mind if I take a look?

172
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,010
随便  Dan  让她看吧
Go ahead, Dan. show her.

173
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,010
这是电池?
Batteries, huh?

174
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,094
这什么
What's this-uhh!

175
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,067
什么?
What?

176
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,028
那个女人  那个女人叫什么名字
That woman- what was her name?

177
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,013
Harper
Harper.

178
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,021
你们是朋友?
The two of you friends?

179
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:21,064
也不完全是  她是我的理疗师
Not exactly. she wamy therast.

180
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:23,008
你们配有理疗师?
You people had therapists?

181
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,038
干那工作  压力很大
It's very stressful.

182
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,010
虽说是你的理疗师  对你怀有敌意啊
Seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.

183
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,074
我相信肯定过去的有些事情
I'm sure there are things from your past

184
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,093
你提都不想提
That you'd rather not talk about.

185
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:36,050
是嘛  我的档案你都看到了啊
Yeah. you read them all in my file.

186
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,088
相信我  Jack  你一定不想看到我的档案
Trust me, Jack. you don't wanna see my file.

187
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,034
问题就出在
The problem occurs

188
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,089
在第六个月的时候
Somewhere during the second trimester,

189
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,072
当时母体的免疫系统正被激发
When the mother's immune system is triggered.

190
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,055
血液中的白细胞数量急剧下降
The white blood cell count plummets.

191
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:57,098
就好像  免疫系统对胚胎有排斥
It's like the... immune system turns on the fetus.

192
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,033
我可以看下吗
May i?

193
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,008
好的
Sure.

194
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,079
知道什么原因了吗
Any thought yet on a cause?

195
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,023
现在下定论还为时过早
Mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women

196
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,069
但只有在这个岛上怀孕的女人才有这种反应
Who've conceived on the island does it happen to...

197
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,086
-这让我很诧异  -juliet
Which makes me wonder- hey, juliet.

198
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,019
噢  ben  我不知道你在这
Oh, ben, I didn't know you were here.

199
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:28,037
Ethan生病了,冰箱李还有一份鸡蛋色拉
Ethan's out sick. I have an extra egg salad on rye.

200
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,060
-我就过来看看juliet要不要吃  -我吃过了  谢谢
I was just checking to see if juliet wants it. thanks. no, already ate.

201
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,082
噢 ,还有,十分钟后,我会和你妻子碰个面
Oh, besides, I have an appoinent with your wife in ten minutes.

202
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,059
好的  替我和她打个招呼
Great. tell her I said hi.

203
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,060
好的
Oh, will do.

204
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,057
Ben?
Ben?

205
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,033
我没事
No, I'm fine.

206
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:00,093
那么  juliet
So, juliet,

207
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:02,094
你觉得ben这人怎么样
What do you think of ben?

208
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,023
相当精明
Uh, very smart...

209
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:11,008
专注
And intense.

210
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,070
有挑战精神
Challenging.

211
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,029
他一直对我很好
He's been really good to me.

212
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,028
那是当然啦  你好像喜欢他
Of course he has. you look just like her.

213
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:20,052
什么
I'm sorry?

214
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,071
我发现你和我丈夫关系很好
And I see you and my husband have become friendly.

215
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:30,035
是啊  他人不错
Yeah. he's great.

216
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:33,012
他确实很能干
He's been really helpful.

217
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,012
你什么时候开始和他上床的?
When did you start sleeping with him?

218
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,022
什么?
What?

219
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,083
听着  juliet  不要当我是白痴
Look, juliet, I'm not an idiot.

220
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,036
你就直说吧  什么时候
So just tell me. when did it start?

221
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:54,097
-我根本就没有  -我们已经分手了
Okay. I'not doing this. we're done.

222
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,092
你就别在耍我了
Now please respect me enough

223
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,052
别再装了  做都做了
To spare me the pretense that you are actually offended.

224
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,038
我都知道了
I know.

225
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,029
我跟踪你
I followed you.

226
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,050
监视你
Watched you.

227
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,069
对不起
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,001
无所谓了
It doesn't matter anymore.

229
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:22,031
现在重要的是你得听我的
But what does matter is that you listen to me

230
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,096
你给我记着
And that you believe me.

231
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,033
要是你再和goodwin
And if you continue

232
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:32,095
乱搞的话
To have a relationship with goodwin,

233
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:35,073
后果自负吧
There will be consequences.

234
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,083
我不想伤他的心
I don't want him to get hurt.

235
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,092
我永远都不愿伤害他
I would never hurt him.

236
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:44,047
我不是在说你
Look it, I am not talking about you.

237
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,057
我说的是ben
I am talking about ben.

238
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,046
嗨  john
Hi, john.

239
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,011
嗨  claire
Hey, claire.

240
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:04,012
能为你效劳吗
Is there something I can do for you?

241
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,012
我想知道你把Miles怎么了
I wanna know what's going on with miles.

242
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,085
现在还不好说
Right now not a whole lot.

243
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,093
我给他吃的喝的
I'm... bringing him food and water

244
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,097
直到他决定开口再决定
Until he decides to talk.

245
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,056
我想和他谈谈
I'd like to talk to him melf.

246
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:21,039
-为什么?  -John  我们得查出
And why would you want to do that? john, we have to find out

247
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,070
他们是谁  来自哪里
Who these people are and where they came from

248
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,086
为什么不愿救我们
And why they're not interested ine scuing us.

249
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,058
难度你觉得这些我都问不出来?
And you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?

250
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,056
不是的  我
No, i...

251
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,016
我想也许我们的方法不对头
I just think we might be taking the wrong approach.

252
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:36,088
我是说  你杀了一个  ben开枪打死了一个
I mean, you killed one, ben shot one,

253
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,096
现在还拘捕了一个
And now we're holding one prisoner.

254
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,053
你知道  这样就不难理解
You know, it's not hard to understand

255
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,084
为什么他们认为我们是有敌意的
Why they might think we're hostile.

256
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,015
或许我要相对友好些
I might be just a little less intimidating.

257
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,076
你就死了这条心吧  claire
It's not gonna happen, claire.

258
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:54,092
-John  我不是  -你还记得charlie怎么说这些人的吗
John, I don't- you do remember what charlie said about these people.

259
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,020
charlie只是说
All charlie said

260
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,067
他们的船  不是吗
Was whose boat it isn't.

261
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:03,012
你就不想知道这些船是谁的?
Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?

262
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,034
今天吃兔子肉?
Rabbit today?

263
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,095
鸡吃完了
Running out of chickens.

264
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:34,010
上面没有编号的吧?
This didn't ve a number on it, did it?

265
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,022
吃吧  再把衣服换一换  完了放门边
Eat, change, put your laundry and dishes the door.

266
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:41,065
十五分钟后我来拿
I'll be back to collect them in 15 mites.

267
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,098
革命开始了吗?  或者叫
So has the revolution begun yet? or...

268
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,031
你说什么?
what are you talking about?

269
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:55,012
你是这里的头
Well, you're the leader now.

270
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:56,096
我知道这个头不好当
I know it's a tough position.

271
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:58,044
你得不断地应对人们的猜疑
You have to deal with all those people

272
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,099
他们总在怀疑你的决定
Constantly second-guessing your decisions,

273
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,067
可是他们的猜虑总是很无知  不是吗
And it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it?

274
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,086
问这问那   说三道四的
A question here, a comment there,

275
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:07,074
你要是一不小心
And then if you're not careful,

276
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:11,046
就肯定非得发生暴动不可
You find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands.

277
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:15,051
相信我  你们的人一定会很愤怒
Believe me, your peopl are gonna be so angry

278
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,073
当他们知道你仍然没有什么计划
When they realize you still don't have a plan.

279
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:23,087
这么说你有计划了
and now you assure me that you got a plan.

280
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,090
我早有安排了
I always have a plan.

281
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,023
这和你筹集320万有关?
Does it involve you raising $3.2 million?

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,095
那可不是一笔小数目啊
Phew. that's a lot of money.

283
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,031
等等
Wait.

284
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,024
可能这个能让你开始
Maybe this'll get you started.

285
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,059
把你的脏衣服放到门旁边
Put your laundry and dishes by the door.

286
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,029
我能帮助你  John  我们的道是一样的
I can help you, John. we have shared interests...

287
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,073
或者  至少我们有共同的敌人
Or at least a common enemy.

288
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,066
你是指船上的那些人
And that would be our friends on the freighter.

289
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:59,016
不是他们  是他们的雇主
Not them. the one they work for.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,073
把我放出去  给我点所谓的自由
Let me out of here. give me some semblance of freedom,

291
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:09,019
让我在床上睡觉  用碗吃东西
Let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils,

292
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,019
我向你保证  我会告诉你想知道的
And I give you my word I'll tell you everything you wanna know

293
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,086
-那个派船来的人的一切事情  -但是  想想看
About the person who sent the freighter. yeah, but see,

294
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,077
这有个问题,我不相信你说的
There's the problem. I don't trust your word.

295
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,027
那好吧
All right, then.

296
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,083
我看我早晚都得告诉你
I guess I'll have to show you.

297
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:45,078
我希望这个味道应该不错
I hope this is good.

298
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:49,040
我不懂葡萄酒  就从潜水艇里 拿了这瓶
I don't know much about wine. I swiped this off the sub.

299
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:10,010
我真希望我们能一直这样
I wish we could do this all the time.

300
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,075
我很讨厌我们非得这样
I hate that we have to be so...

301
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:15,029
偷偷摸摸的
Private.

302
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,094
偷偷摸摸怎么了?
What's the matter with being private?

303
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:22,024
太可笑了,我在长椅上睡了一年了
So ridiculous. I've been sleeping on the couch for a year.

304
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,088
为什么我不能告诉她?
Why am I not just telling her?

305
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:29,032
我觉得这不是个好主意
I don't think it's a good idea.

306
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:38,017
为什么?
Why not?

307
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:41,029
Ben不喜欢这样
Ben wouldn't like it.

308
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,024
这是关键?  你在乎Ben的感受?
That's what this is about? you're worried about Ben?

309
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,083
为什么?  因为他喜欢你?
Why? because he has a crush on you?

310
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:52,065
-你知道?  -别逗了  每个人都知道
You know? come on. everyone knows.

311
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:54,097
他像宠物一样跟着你转
He follows you  like a papy.

312
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,007
你不觉得这有问题吗?
And you don't think that's a problem?

313
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:00,097
现在她一定在离这不足公里的地方猫着

他让我负责化学品
He has me working with chemicals

315
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,062
如果我按错了按钮
That could kill every man, woman and child on this island

316
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,091
那足够杀掉这个岛上的男女老幼
If I flip the wrong switch.

317
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:12,016
相信我  Ben的权利够大了
Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate.

318
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:13,084
他根本不管你和我
The last thing he cares about is you and me.

319
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:20,007
有种感觉  他会不高兴的
get the feeling that he would be upset.

320
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:23,034
他会怎么做?
What's Ben gonna do?

321
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,066
Goodwin

322
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,060

You see where the tail landed? yeah, probably in the water.

323
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,028
你跑过去  要在一小时之内到达海岸

324

Ethan  你去机身那边

处于深深的恐惧中

如果他们问及就编个能过的去的故事
Come with an adequate story if they ask.

328
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,050
如果他们不问  就什么也别说

329
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,073
听着  不要卷入其中
Listen, learn, don't get involved.

330
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,070
三天内我要名单  出发吧

Jack  这些人可能跳伞了

让他们尝尝怀疑的代价吧
Let's give 'em e benefit of the doubt.

00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:15,035
我们本打算追上他们
We've been trying to catch up with them.

349

你知道他们要去哪吗?

350
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,034
类似于

你没打算把我带出丛林
You're not leading me out into the jungle

360
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:07,028
你可以消失

我怎么知道你会不会跑

368

如果我的人还需要我  John

他们早就把这营地推平了

00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,075
这是Chles Widmore
This is chles widmore.

375
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:57,034
就是他派船来的
This is the man whose boat is parked offshore.

00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:03,011
就是他一直在寻找这个岛
This is the man that's been trying to find the island.

377
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,009
那个蒙着眼的人是谁?

378
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,081
我的人里有一个不幸被抓到了
One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.

John  三个月前在佛罗里达的Gainesville

一个旧的居住区的附近
In a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex.

384
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:29,060
当他说出那些话

385
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,090
有超过5000人看到了她的脸
Over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves.

386
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,019
你在空难中幸存了

前一分钟  你在坐在轮椅上

388

下一分钟  你就能跳舞了
The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks.

389
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:43,077
如果有5000个人看到模具
If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold,

390
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:47,015
那么多少人会来这看你呢?

Charles Widmore想要开发这个岛
Charles widmore wants to exploit this island,

392
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,001
他会不息一切代价完成

393

有些很模糊  有些全凭猜测

这是所有的事情  现在都归你了

很抱歉  我没有早点告诉你这些

我想找点东西

你想告诉我,或者我们继续走,直到走出丛林

412
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,019
如果不重要的话?
Like it doesn't matter?

413
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,054
我在那里是想知道
I stayed to find out

414
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:38,037
船上的人知不知道我是谁
If the people on the freighter know who I am,

415
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,084
他们是否知道我是一个逃犯

416
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:43,029
一个凶杀案的嫌犯

00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:01,038
我想我应该说得再清楚些

因为你和Zach和Emma相处得很好

他们会及时住嘴的
They'll stop asking in time.

438
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,028
他们只是孩子
They're children.

439
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,089
真的适合呆在这儿吗?
Do they really belong here?

440
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:38,034
他们在名单上  Juliet
They're on the list,Juliet.

441
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:41,035
我们又有什么资格去问谁在名单上谁又不在?
Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?

442
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,019
现在所有从尾舱来的在册人员都在这里
Now that we have everyone on the list from the tail section,

这几周都不见他的踪影

他在调查这个女人 -Anna Lucia

他觉得她会对我们很有价值

449
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:13,007

00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,025
在Ethan死后  这是在冒险
After losing ethan,it's a risk.

451

Goodwin正在做他该做的  Juliet

452
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:22,039
没什么原因会让他这么着急回去  对吧?
