00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,089
就是芬兰的第二次巡回演出的
Second tour of Finland.

155
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,024
我们得抓紧
We gotta keep moving.

156
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,009
那生动的一幕  确实让人印象深刻
And to see that come to life was pretty impressive.

157
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,023
上帝啊
Aah! Oh, my god!

158
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,054
在我们前面拍摄的摄像机抖个不停
There was a camera in front of us bouncing around,

159
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,048
我们也跑得抖来抖去  看上去惊慌失措
And we were bouncing around and looking terrified,

160
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,034
但真实情况是  
But we're really just basically

161
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:32,019
我们当时只是在一个自动式的跑步机上
on a self-propelled treadmill,

162
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,075
而拍摄那一幕  你自己演的时候
And that kind of stuff, you--you do it

163
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,066
你会觉得很可笑  
And you feel ridiculous doing it

164
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,019
而看到(处理后)的就真实了不少
and then you see it come to life

165
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,060
你会意识到是多么让人印象深刻
And you realize how impressive it looks.

166
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,097
都是在喷水塔之下拍摄的
That was all shot under water towers,

167
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,004
基本都是些消防软管
Which are basically fire hoses.

168
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:48,008
体温下降的速度令人难以置信
It's unbelievable how far your temperature drops.

169
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,062
那些充满惊恐的战栗  可不是演出来的
All of that trembling in terror? No acting involved.

170
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,024
我当时被冷死了
I was just freezing.

171
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:55,011
Jack
Jack!

172
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,036
由于有很多的演员  问题也出现了
A lot of the casting came out of, like,

173
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:00,044
往往都比较喜欢找和自己相处融洽的演员合作
Finding actors they wanted to work with,

174
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,063
而不看他们是否适合这个角色
Rather than necessarily fill in a role.

175
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:05,090
-我受够了这个乡下人  -要打一架吗
- I'm sick of this redneck! - You want some more of me, boy?!

176
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,022
我们都是一起的  哥们
Hey! We're all in this together, man.

177
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,038
-都互相尊重点  -闭嘴  死肥猪
- Let's treat each other with a little respect. - Shut up, Lardo.

178
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,017
起初  只是希望我能达标
First it was just, wow, I hope I'm on the level

179
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:17,015
而不至于被炒  因为他们都是很优秀的演员
And I don't get fired 'cause they're all wonderful actors.

180
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:16,019
Josh Holloway 饰 Sawyer

181
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,093
当得知  我们基本上得抛开一切  
Knowing that we were all gonna basically...

182
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,092
搬到夏威夷去
drop everything and move to Hawaii

183
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:23,071
而且就真的在那岛上一起生活
And have to live together on an island, literally,

184
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,026
他们想找的是
They wanted to find people

185
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:27,015
不管在台上台下都能产生良好化学反应
Who seemed to have good chemistry with each other

186
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:30,038
的演员  -你人不错  我喜欢
On and offscreen. You're okay. I like you.

187
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,020
你人也不错
You're okay, too.

188
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,077
非常感谢扮演角色的多样性
I grew to have such an appreciation for the diversity in- -in these characters

189
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:42,062
因为能为该剧加入如此这般观点
Because it really added such perspective to the show,

190
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:46,021
我感觉这剧能把全世界的距离拉近
And I feel like made it a show that the world could relate to.

191
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,084
就是这  宝宝在踢我
there! Right there! That's a kick!

192
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,027
演员阵容空前的国际化
Never before had a seen a cast that was truly international,

193
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,042
Daniel Dae Kim 饰 Jin

194
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,077
在台前台后  这些演员
Both in reality of the actors

195
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,025
不仅是在饰演这些角色  
Who were playing the characters and

196
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,049
同时自己也是角色本身
the characters themselves.

197
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,061
来自世界各地的演员
we had people flown in from all over the world.

198
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:05,029
我来自韩国  Naveen Andrews来自英国
I had just come in from korea, Naveen Andrews from the U.K.

199
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,052
Dominic也是  Emilie来自澳大利亚  
And Dominic, of course. Emilie from Australia

200
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,080
Evangeline Lilly来自Canada  真的很不错
And Evangeline Lilly from Canada. It was beautiful.

201
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,079
我觉得我们在为美国电视改头换面
I felt like we were changing the face of american television.

202
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,064
Yunjin Kim 饰 Sun

203
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,097
好吧  如果我是罪犯  那你就是恐怖分子
Fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist.

204
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:19,010
我们可以各演各的  你要演谁
We can all play a part. Who you wanna be?

205
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,057
我们都近似于十指握紧了祈祷了
We were all just kind of crossing our fingers--

206
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,041
"希望观众能喜欢"
"I hope--I hope they like it."

207
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:27,041
我当时想  这剧要么红的一塌糊涂
I thought, this is going to either be a huge success,

208
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,036
要么跌入万劫不复的深渊
Or we're gonna go down in flames.

209
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:32,007
所以试播首映了以后  
So it wasn't until the day after that the pilot premiered

210
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:34,049
我就知道《迷失》肯定有戏了
I knew that I was gonna be doing "Lost" For quite a while.

211
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,080
能行吗
Is it working?

212
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,089
貌似行  只不过没有接收到任何信号
Seems to be, except we're not picking up a signal.

213
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,084
我们只有一个选择可以尝试
There is one thing we could try--

214
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,094
看看在高处能否接收到信号
Seeing if we can get the signal from high ground.

215
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,081
我当时寻思着《迷失》应该有戏
I figured that they would have to give it a shot

216
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,073
因为他们花了这么大一番功夫
Because they seemed to have gone to so much effort

217
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,056
来制作第一集  结果事实证明  千万观众
to produce the first one. However many million people

218
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,074
连续三周都在观看  我当时想
Watched it for three weeks in a row, I thought,

219
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:56,007
这是不是好的过头了点
Oh, this--this looks like it might do all right for a while.

220
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,008
-快跑  -Sawyer
- Go! Go! - Sawyer!

221
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:01,005
很明显  《迷失》不是一个寻常的求生故事
It was clear "Lost" Was no ordinary tale of survival,

222
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:04,036
这只是开始
And this was only the beginning.

223
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,028
记得当时貌似是有个通宵
It was kinda overnight...

224
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,054
伙计们  这只可不止是熊  是北极熊
Guys, this isn't just a bear. It's a polar bear.

225
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,016
我当时刚去健完身  浑身是汗
I was coming from the gym, all sweaty,

226
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,008
有几位女士走过说道  
And some girls went by and went,

227
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:17,023
"哦  你是...这味道...恶心"
"Oh, it's... Ew! Ew!"

228
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,096
我成了"恶心"了吗
And I'm like, "Ew?"

229
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:21,013
我猜以后刚健完身  肯定不能
Wow, I guess I can't go out in public, like,

230
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:23,017
再这样出现在公众面前了
Fresh from the gym anymore.

231
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,039
必须得注意形象了
You know, you have to be presentable.

232
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,066
有信号了  求救  求救
Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday!

233
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,081
很少有剧能被如此赞扬
It's rare for something to be critically acclaimed

234
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,033
我估计很大部分是来自大众的赞扬
And, uh, I guess, acclaimed by the public.

235
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,048
是遇险信号
it's a distress call.

236
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:39,044
我想就是在那时候
I think it was at that point that I thought,

237
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:43,030
事情变得有点...不可预料了
Well, this is turning into something, that, uh, I couldn't really have predicted.

238
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,016
这已经反复播放了16年了
It's been playing over and over for 16 years.

239
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,059
伙计们
Guys...

240
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,095
我们到底在哪
Where are we?

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,059
你丈夫也在飞机上吗
So, your husband-- was he on the flight?

242
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,065
没有  我还没结婚
Oh, no, I'm not married.

243
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:07,075
谁需要男人啊  对吧  那么没用
Who needs men, right? Bloody useless.

244
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,019
《迷失》的核心精髓在于
"Lost" is, at its heart and soul,

245
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,044
角色的研究
a character study.

246
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:14,053
Damon Lindelof 联合执行制片人之一

247
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,085
作为讲故事的人  我们也很被其中的
We're fascinated, as storytellers,

248
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:17,070
"人的行为决定了他是怎样一个人"所吸引
by what makes people the way they are.

249
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,069
总的来说  我最喜欢第一季
On the whole, season 1 was my favorite,

250
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,085
那时候我们正在研究人物角色
Where we started to learn about these characters

251
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:25,027
我们开始关注这些角色
and we started to care about these characters.

252
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:27,015
因为角色充满了神秘  但又无答案
They were these mysteries that were unsolved

253
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:29,091
让人很干着急  因为根本没答案
And they were tantalizing because there were no answers.

254
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:31,025
关于该剧取名为《迷失》
The title "Lost" Was really about

255
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:33,031
Carlton Cuse  联合执行制片人之一

256
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,046
其实是在隐射这些角色是怎样在生活中迷失的
How these characters were sort of lost in their own lives.

257
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,014
而对我们而言  该剧真正的神秘之处
And for us, the real mystery of the show

258
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,061
不是说"这个岛到底在哪"
Wasn't, you know, "Where is this island?"

259
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,081
而是"这些人到底是谁"
But the mystery of the show was, "Who are these people?"

260
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,023
首先要介绍给各位观众的角色是
And the first character audiences were introduced to

261
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,014
Jack Shephard医生
was Dr. Jack Shephard.

262
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:49,014
这些角色遭遇了坠机之后
These characters amidst this plane crash

263
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:54,018
被这个有强烈救生欲望的男人所感染
See this man and sort of activated by his desire to save people.

264
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,079
听我说
Listen to me.

265
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,097
看着我  你会没事的  知道吗
Look at me. You're gonna be okay. Do you understand me?

266
00:10:57,097 --> 00:11:00,068
但你现在坐着绝对不能动
But you have to sit absolutely still.

267
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,014
他当时更像是被选为了领导者
He is elected as the leader a bit,

268
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,031
他当时真的很沉默
And he's really reticent

269
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,022
之所以无法胜任领导者
And doesn't feel equipped to do that

270
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,019
是因为他与他父亲之间还有问题没解决
because of all of his issues with his father.

271
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,037
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

272
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:12,052
我在说你要把这女孩的囊腔缝好
I'm talking about you stitching up the sac

273
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:15,032
否则她下半辈子都会瘫痪
So this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life.

274
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:18,009
Jack活在他父亲Christian的阴影之下  
Jack lived in the shadow of his father, Christian...

275
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,074
我知道你不相信我  但我得要他们相信我
I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to.

276
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:24,073
你觉得确定我才是不相信你的人吗  Jack
Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

277
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,010
Christian却在悉尼死了
Although Christian died in Sydney...

278
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,026
就是他
that's him.

279
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:33,030
Jack与他父亲的问题跟他来到了岛上
Jack's issues with his father followed him to the island.

280
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
爸爸 
Dad?

281
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,056
要知道这种机会可不是每天都有
It's very rare that you would get an opportunity to play

282
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:47,039
尤其是六年来一直扮演这样一位医生
A character over a 6-year arc that has had such an arc.

283
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,032
-我不是领导者  -但他们都当你是
- I'm not a leader. - And yet, they all treat you like one.

284
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:52,004
饰演这人的经历
The experience of playing this guy

285
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,016
遭受与他一样的遭遇
and going through what he's had to go through

286
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,049
尽我所能地讲诉他的故事
And trying to tell his story the very best that I can

287
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,079
这种感觉棒极了  这经历让人难忘
Has been great. It's been an amazing experience.

288
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,001
打扰一下
Excuse me!

289
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,070
你有空吗  能帮我个小忙吗
Do you have a second? I could use a little help here.

290
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,018
我是医生  我可以自己缝
Look, I'd do it myself. I'm a doctor.

291
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,026
-但我够不着  -你要我给你缝上吗
- But I just can't reach it. - You want me to sew that up?

292
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:11,011
-如果你不介意的话  -当然  不介意
- If you wouldn't mind. - Of course I will.

293
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,011
谢谢
Thank you.

294
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,032
Kate

295
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,060
你好啊  美女
hey, girl.

296
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:18,033
Kate Austen就像是一位邻家女孩
Kate Austen appeared to be the girl next door,

297
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:21,038
但她在逃避她那不堪的过去
But she was running from a turbulent past.

298
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,032
你真美
You are beautiful.

299
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,052
在杀掉她那有虐待倾向的继父以后...
After killing her abusive stepfather...

300
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,054
Katherine  你干了什么
Katherine... What did you do?

301
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,077
我保护了你  妈妈
I took care of you, ma.

302
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:33,088
Kate成了一名逃亡者
Kate became a fugitive.

303
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:35,083
和大多数人一样 
Kate's flaws were her--

304
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,090
Kate最大的缺陷  同时也是最大的长处
As with most people, I think- her greatest strengths as well.

305
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,046
就是她的自发性的行为
Her spontaneity was killing her all the time.

306
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:44,036
她做事从不思考  她是行动派
I mean, she didn't think before she moved. She just acted.

307
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,049
别想跑  Kate
Don't run, kate.

308
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,061
Kate是个杀人犯  很奇怪的是人们
Kate was a murderer, and it's very odd to see people

309
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,025
竟支持杀人犯  就如人们支持Kate一样
get behind a murderer as much as they got behind kate.

310
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,084
-我什么也没干  -你当然干了
- I didn't do anything. - Oh, yeah, you did.

311
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:58,008
你妈都已经放弃你了  Kate
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

312
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:03,076
她对别人的关心程度  超乎了人的想象
She really cared about people on a deep, deep level,

313
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:06,014
到了情不自禁的程度
So much so that she couldn't help herself

314
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:08,045
以至于有时会鲁莽行事
From acting out- sometimes stupidly.

315
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:13,046
她在跟踪你们  正如我说的  好奇害死猫
She was following you. Like I said... Curiosity.

316
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:16,054
不过他们总是被她这种好心肠所感动
But they were always driven by this really big heart

317
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:19,093
她只是极度迫切地希望看到
that she has that just desperately wanted to see

318
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:23,011
一切好起来  -我只是想帮忙  Jack
things be right and good. I was just trying to help, Jack.

319
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,089
我想人们对此产生了共鸣
And I think that people sympathize with that.

320
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,059
我想告诉你  我曾做过什么
I wanna tell you what I did.

321
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,022
做过什么不重要  Kate
It doesn't matter, Kate.

322
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:34,002
我们都应该可以重新开始了
We should all be able to start over.

323
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,037
也正因如此  你也会爱上她这个角色
And I think that's what makes you love her, too.

324
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,037
我要呼吸器的话  又得给你什么
What do you want for the inhalers?

325
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:43,016
-我要什么是吧  一个吻就行了  -什么
- What do I want? A kiss oughta do it. - What?

326
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,045
一个吻
A kiss.

327
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,028
就是现在和你接吻
From you, right now.

328
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,057
Sawyer

329
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,016
很不错对吧
Nice, huh?!

330
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,010
我更愿意成为Sawyer  
for me I would love to be Sawyer because-- shocker!

331
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,095
"因为我简直爱上了Sawyer"
Well-- "Because I'm in love with sawyer..."

332
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,041
"我喜欢把衣服脱了"
"And I like to take off my shirt

333
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,000
"然后看着在镜子面前的自己"
And look at myself in the mirror."

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,053
你靠近点给我取取暖如何
How about you come a little closer and warm me up?

335
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,064
你还真会泡妞  Sawyer
You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer.

336
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,075
Sawyer太有意思了
Sawyer is so fun.

337
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,074
他是个英俊的盗贼  很危险也很聪明
I mean, he's the handsome rogue. He's dangerous. He's clever.

338
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,062
-他擅长嘲讽人  -他取了不少成名外号
- He quips. - There's some good ones.

339
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:11,005
你还真会拍人马屁  胖墩
You sure know how to butter a man up, stay puft.

340
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:13,065
我喜欢"胖墩"
I loved "Stay puft."

341
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:17,021
第一季和Jorge的合作蛮有趣的吧
I thought that was kinda funny in the first season with Jorge,

342
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,077
然后是"清洁工先生"
And then "Mr. Clean."

343
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:20,074
你只需要带上耳环和一头蓬松的头发
All you need's an earring and a mop.

344
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:23,041
我想这对Terry的描述恰如其分
I think that perfectly describes Terry.

345
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,056
Lapidus...
Lapidus...

346
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,077
喂  Kenny Rogers[著名歌手]  
Hey, Kenny Rogers.

347
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,045
Kenny Rogers
Kenny rogers.

348
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:28,005
你有什么问题吗  "超宽银幕"
What's your problem, Jumbotron?

349
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:31,061
闭嘴  你这"乡巴佬"
Shut up... Redneck... Man.

350
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,080
有进步
Touche.

351
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,037
叫Hurley外号是非常有趣的一件事
It would be a lot of fun to call Hurley nicknames and, uh--

352
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,046
口头禅就是"婊子养的"
Say "Son of a bitch" All the time?

353
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,034
对  一直挂在嘴边的就是"婊子养的"
And say "Son of a bitch"-- "Son of a bitch" All the time.

354
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,030
来吧  说来听听  -婊子养的
Go ahead. Give it a shot. - Son of a bitch.

355
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,091
婊子养的  婊子养的
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

356
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,002
说的不错  你现在可以把衣服脱了
It's good. Now take your shirt off.

357
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,017
尽管扮演一个说话欠揍的角色很有意思
it's a lot of fun to play a salty character

358
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,021
但也挺有幽默感的
But that has a sense of humor.

359
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:54,000
不过我有点担心他不能幸存
But I was worried about his survival

360
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,070
因为他太难与人相处了  闭嘴
Because he was so hard. Shut up!

361
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,065
你想知道我是什么样的人是吗  自己读吧
You wanna know what kind of human being I am? Read it.

362
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,027
亲爱的Sawyer先生
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,

363
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,036
你可能不认识我  但我认识你
"You don't know who I am, but I know who you are,

364
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:08,033
而且我知道你的所作所为
And I know what you done."

365
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,036
躲床下去
get under the bed.

366
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,004
-千万别出声  -开门
- Don't make a sound.  - Open this door!

367
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,045
在他还是个孩子的时候
As a young boy...

368
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,093
James Ford亲眼目睹了父母的被杀与自杀
James Ford witnessed his parents' murder/suicide...

369
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,022
你要干嘛  你想怎样
What are you doing? ! What the hell are you--

370
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:20,002
一个叫做Sawyer的男人
Brought on when a man called Sawyer

371
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,054
剥夺了他的一切
made off with everything they had.

372
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,010
报仇成了他活着的唯一目的
Revenge became his life's purpose,

373
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,099
从此他以要追杀的这个人的名字自居
And he took on the identity of the man he sought.

374
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:31,030
这封信不是写给你的  是你自己写的
This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter.

375
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,077
我认为在那特别的一刻  终于有人发现
I think that was a major moment, him being found out--

376
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:37,071
他深藏多年的秘密
You know, what his kind of dark secret is--

377
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,069
一直以来他自我保护的盔甲终于露出一道缝隙
really put a chink in his armor and...

378
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:44,096
他仁慈的一面从此流出
allowed his humanity to seep out of that.

379
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,013
我觉得你这辈子从来没拷问过什么人
I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life.

380
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,075
对咱俩都很不幸的是
Unfortunately for us both...

381
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,075
你错了
You're wrong.

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,054
Sayid

383
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:55,068
我曾是个通讯军官
I was a military communications officer.

384
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:57,001
我曾参加过海湾战争
I fought in the Gulf War.

385
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,016
你是什么  空军  陆军
What were you-- air force, army?

386
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,064
共和国卫队
The Republican Guard.

387
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,093
Sayid Jarrah的过去黑暗而又痛苦
Sayid Jarrah battled with a dark past.

388
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:07,033
我觉得你有新能力可用
I guess you have a new skill set you can use.

389
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,013
这马上就能引起你的兴趣
It immediately spikes your interest,

390
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,098
然后你就想  这是个诡计吗
And then you think, you know, is this a gimmick?

391
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:13,056
为什么他们要这么做  这个人是个好人呢
Why are they doing this? Is this person gonna be a human being,

392
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,016
还是其他什么的
As opposed to some kind of symbol

393
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:18,040
比如说  不那么吸引人的角色
Or something, uh, shall we say, less attractive?

394
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,001
Noor Abed Jazeem
Noor Abed Jazeem.

395
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,045
我来问你一些问题
I'm going to ask you some questions.

396
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:26,001
没人叫我"Noor"  Sayid
Nobody calls me "Noor", Sayid.

397
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:29,025
这个角色不同寻常的一点是他很浪漫
What was unusual was that this character was a romantic.

398
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,054
这不是游戏  Nadia
This isn't a game, Nadia.

399
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,077
而你却一直在玩  Sayid
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

400
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,032
内心某处  他还是有很纯洁的地方
Somewhere, there's this part of him that is pure

401
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:40,015
让他尝试各种赎罪
that will allow him to find some kind of redemption.

402
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,085
这部剧最了不起的一点是
One of the greatest things about this show

403
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,086
编剧们相当聪明
is that the writers were smart enough

404
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:48,058
总是先给你一个假象  结果截然不同
to show us a stereotype and then flip it on its head.

405
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,055
上周  我们大家还都是陌生人
Last week, most of us were strangers.

406
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:52,013
不同国家的人们
People of different countries,

407
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,095
不同种族的人们  显然还有不同性别的人
of different races, of, obviously, different genders,

408
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,099
都一直在尝试如何建立一个社会系统
are trying to figure out how to build a society.

409
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,038
但我们现在都到了这里
But we're all here now.

410
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,026
只有上帝才知道我们要在这待多久
And God knows how long we're gonna be here.

411
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:05,066
这部剧的核心是在问一个问题
At its core, it still is a story that asks the question,

412
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,012
我们能够和谐生存吗
Can we all get along?

413
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,030
但如果我们不能共融共存
But if we can't live together...

414
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:14,043
那只能孤独死去
We're gonna die alone.

415
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:30,090
这座岛有很多秘密  但都没有
The island held many mysteries, none more significant

416
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,085
潜伏在丛林中的黑烟更神秘
than the monster that lurked in the jungle.

417
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,000
又来了
there it is again.

418
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,095
但有一人成功幸存  与岛和谐相处
But there was one survivor who embraced the island

419
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:43,002
并因此产生了新的信仰
and explored it with renewed faith.

420
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,046
Locke

421
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,041
Walt  你想知道一个秘密吗
Walt, do you wanna know a secret?

422
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,018
发现Locke原来是坐轮椅的  太惊讶了
Finding out that Locke was in a wheelchair was huge.

423
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:50,016
Jorge Garcia扮演Hurley

424
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,081
在最初拍摄的一两集里  我并不知道
Well, I didn't know in the first episode or two that we shot

425
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:53,035
Terry O'Quinn扮演Locke

426
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,085
Locke实际上是坐在轮椅里的
that Locke, in fact, had been in a wheelchair.

427
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,016
-John  -在坠机之前  John Locke因瘫痪
- John.  - Before the crash, John Locke had suffered

428
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:01,073
备受折磨  这都是他父亲一手造成的
a paralyzing fall at the hands of his father.

429
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,061
这使他成为一个残疾人并寻求活着的目的
The incident left him a broken man searching for purpose.

430
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,056
飞机上的John Locke
The John Locke that got on the airplane

431
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,014
空有梦想  其它一无所有
just lived in dreams, and he had nothing else.

432
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:14,026
我觉得他几乎是可有可无的
And I think he was almost an invisible man.

433
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:18,012
当我看到Locke居然能站起来时
When I saw the scene when Locke stands up...

434
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,012
真是令人动容  这对我来说
and it was very moving and... That, to me, told me something

435
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:23,045
告诉了我这部剧的发展方向  就好像
about the possibilities for the show. It sort of--

436
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,012
我的视角一下子变大了  就像这样
my vision went from here to here, you know, just like that.

437
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,048
岛上有很多东西提供给我们
There are plenty of things on this island

438
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,087
让我们生存
we can use for sustenance.

439
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:32,014
那我们到底怎样才能找到这些
And exactly how are we gonna find this sustenance?

440
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,003
我们打猎  就在那一瞬间
We hunt. And all of a sudden,

441
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,093
他领悟到他可以成为这样一个人
the possibility was presented to him that he could be somebody,

442
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,029
他可以决定事情的结果
that he could influence the outcome of events,

443
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,021
而且人们真的会听他的
and that people would actually listen to him.

444
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,009
这简直太诱人了
That was hugely seductive.

445
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,068
我与这个岛对视
I've looked into the eye of this island,

446
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:51,011
我发现它美极了  我从未听人说过
and what I saw was beautiful. I never heard the voice that said,

447
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,039
"岛是有眼睛的
"This is the eye of the island,

448
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:54,054
你正与它对视  John
and you're looking into it, John."

449
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:57,039
但是他将它解释为与岛有特殊的关系
But he interpreted it as having a special relationship

450
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,021
也的确如此
with the island. He made that.

451
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,097
我们被带到这来是有原因的
We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason--

452
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,074
我们所有人  
All of us.

453
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,010
是谁带我们来的  John
And who brought us here, John?

454
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:05,078
这个岛  我一直有种感觉
The island. I always had a sense,

455
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,053
Jack与Locke的分歧将是
you know, that that was gonna be

456
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:11,060
本剧最主要的矛盾
a fundamental battle in the show was the jack/locke dynamic.

457
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,050
我想这就是为什么
I think that's why

458
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,064
你和我看法不一致  Jack
you and I don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack,

459
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:18,020
-因为你是个相信科学的人  -你在想什么
- Because you're a man of science.  -What does that make you?

460
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,057
我是个相信信仰的人  我很容易
I'm a man of faith. It was easy

461
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,079
将Locke的方方面面联系起来
for me to relate to all these aspects of Locke.

462
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,025
我只想待在岛上  住在树林里
I just wanted to stay on the island, live in the woods,

463
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:26,016
-给大家提提建议  -今天是我生日
- give people good advice.  - It's my birthday today.

464
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,091
至少你和你的孩子  你们生日挨得很近
At least your birthdays will be close together, you and your baby.

465
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:30,058
-这是好运  -你相信这是好运吗
- And that's good luck.  - You believe in that?

466
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,024
我相信很多事情
I believe in a lot of things.

467
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,007
生日快乐  Claire
Happy birthday, Claire.

468
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,062
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,072
Charlie与Claire

470
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,098
第一次坠机吧
So... First plane crash?

471
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:45,050
-怎么猜到的  -我总能嗅到菜鸟的味道
- What gave it away?  - Ah, I can always spot the newbies.

472
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:49,046
Claire Littleton在坠机前孤身一人
Claire Littleton was alone at the time of the crash,

473
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:51,075
但很快与Charlie Pace结为好友
but found a friend in Charlie Pace.

474
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,008
他们的关系非常微妙
They had a very interesting relationship.

475
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:57,094
有很多美好的瞬间  比如花生酱罐子
So many moments were so sweet, like the peanut butter jar.

476
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,057
花生酱
Peanut butter?!

477
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,075
是你点的呀
Just like you ordered.

478
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,055
谢天谢地  是假的花生酱
Thank god it was fake peanut butter

479
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,028
因为我对它过敏很厉害
'cause I'm terribly allergic.

480
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,014
我读这段剧本的时候  我就想  真棒
So I'm reading that. I'm like, oh, great!

481
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,042
我唯一不能吃的东西  他们偏偏给了我
The one thing I can't eat, they got me.

482
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,006
超细腻
Extra smooth.

483
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:12,098
这是我吃过的最棒的花生酱
It's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted.

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,077
这个角色非常好
She's a very sweet,

485
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,050
是那种不会怀揣怨恨的女孩
doesn't-hold-grudges kind of girl.

486
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:20,019
而她的内心又惊人的坚强
But has this just incredible sort of inner strength,

487
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,044
她不得不在那种荒郊野岭
Having to deal with being pregnant and having a child

488
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:26,035
挺着大肚子  还要生孩子
in not the comfiest location for that to happen,

489
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,081
很难想象
I would imagine.

490
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:31,005
Claire  你在这干什么
Claire? What are you doing out here? Mm.

491
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,088
没什么  不用管我  谢了
Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.

492
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,078
有一集我走开了  我当时想
One of the episodes that I walked away from and thought,

493
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:40,036
哇塞  太妙了
Holy crap, that was so... boop--good,

494
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:42,036
那集Boone死了
was the episode where Boone dies

495
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,049
小Aaron出生了
and little baby Aaron is born.

496
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,028
准备好了吗  来吧  再来一遍
Ready? Come on. One more.

497
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,005
使劲  使劲  使劲
Push! Push! Push, push, push, push!

498
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:00,045
生与死
You know, the death and the birth

499
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:02,049
一条逝去的生命
and the falling away of one thing

500
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,014
换来一个新生命
to give life to a new thing--

501
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,020
这简直太神奇了
It was just executed so dramatically.

502
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,004
那一集真的相当棒
That was a really special episode.

503
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,033
Charlie因此成为了
And Charlie has become

504
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:14,037
孩子的养父  他们三个
sort of the surrogate father for the child. The three of them

505
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:16,067
俨然成了《Lost》中出现过的
kinda comprised the closest thing to a nuclear family

506
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,016
最和睦的家庭
that exists on "Lost"

507
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,010
我爱你
I love you.

508
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,036
我们要找什么来着
What are we looking for again?

509
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:25,014
长的金属或塑料管子
Uh, any long piece of metal or plastic tubing.

510
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,026
只要看上去能做支架的
Anything that looks like, uh, it'll work as a frame.

511
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,063
这部剧第一个真正打动人的情景
The first really profound moment of the show

512
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,011
就是第一季的结尾
was at the end of the first season

513
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,060
-木筏下水起航了  -我觉得这棒极了
- When we had the raft launch.  - Oh, I thought it was pretty great.

514
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,093
能下水  看上去真的像个木筏
You know, pretty seaworthy. I mean, it looked--it was a raft.

515
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:39,025
这些人找了些看上去能在岛上找到的材料
Those guys made it out of materials that they found

516
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,025
并将其做成了木筏
and could have been on the island.

517
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:46,032
实际上它比镜头上所看到的更加结实耐用
It was, uh, actually more stable than the camera boat.

518
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,058
组装的真快
It's coming together fast.

519
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:50,024
这个木筏给这个剧带来了希望
The raft was this real measure of hope for the show--

520
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,055
因为它可能真的能带大家离开这个岛
The idea that they could actually get off the island.

521
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:56,089
和Jack待在一起  他会照顾你的

522
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,061
那谁来照顾你呢

523
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,048
我觉得这像是达到了一个高潮
I felt like it was a culmination of all the work

524
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:06,043
大家为此辛苦了一整年
that people had put in for a very difficult year.

525
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:08,093
我感觉像是在庆祝
And I felt like it was a celebration

526
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:12,077
这部剧的起源与发展
of where the show started from and where it had come.

527
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,076
起航  保持直行
Lift! And keep it straight!

528
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:19,037
这个场景让你真正意识到
It's one of those moments where you really understand

529
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,028
制作一部电视剧 需要大家共同努力付出
making of a television series is an incredibly collaborative effort.

530
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,037
推  推  推
Go! Go! Go!

531
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:27,070
实际上大约有300人共同合作
It's about literally 300 people doing something in unison.

532
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:35,058
我们写了剧本  然后你们看到成片
You know, we had written the scene, but then you see the film

533
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:37,072
你们看到Jack Bender[导演]是如何执导的
and you see the way Jack Bender executed the scene,

534
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:40,043
并感受到所有演员带来的情感冲击
and then you see the emotion that all the actors brought.

535
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:42,069
我跟你说什么来着
Ah! What'd I tell you, huh?

536
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,077
除此以外  我们与Michael Giacchino[配乐]一起
Then on top of that, we went to the scoring stage

537
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:49,033
去了录音棚  背景音乐实在太美了
with Michael Giacchino, and the cue was so beautiful

538
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,086
当它结束时  所有人都哭了
That when it was over, everybody was crying,

539
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,093
因为听着音乐响起
Because it was playing

540
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:54,042
看着木筏起航的画面
and the images of the raft launch were going on,

541
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,036
演奏完之后大家都用弓子
and they all started tapping their bows

542
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:58,041
敲击乐器  热烈鼓掌
against their instruments and clapping.

543
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,099
那一瞬间感情全部爆发出来
And it was just this profound emotional moment.

544
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:03,008
看到电视魔术般的将那一场景
To see the magic of television

545
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,082
变得如同史诗一样
make that into a scene that became as epic as it was...

546
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:09,005
-没错  -简直太神奇了
- Yeah.  - You know, it's almost mythological.

547
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:11,005
就像荷马创作《奥德赛》一样
It's almost like Homer taking off on his Odyssey.

548
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:12,017
这是一次英雄般的航行
It's a heroic journey,

549
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:15,024
-令人敬畏  叹为观止  -没错
- And it was awe-inspiring for me. Literally awesome. - Yeah.

550
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,088
《Lost》的故事需要一个独特的背景
The story of "Lost" required a unique backdrop

551
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:33,035
使得生存与神秘的故事情节得以展开
where its dramatic tale of survival and mystery could unfold.

552
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:37,087
夏威夷的欧胡岛成为了最终的选址
The island of Oahu in Hawaii proved to be the ultimate location.

553
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:40,017
我说"亲爱的  我们要去夏威夷啦"
I said, "Honey, we're going to Hawaii."

554
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,062
Henry Ian Cusick扮演Desmond

555
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:41,086
然后她问"在哪"  我们就找地图
And she went, "Where is that? " We looked on the map.

556
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,049
我们看着太平洋那片就想  老天啊  就在那吗
And we looked at the pacific and thought, Jeez, that's it?

557
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,008
-周围什么都没有  -夏威夷太棒了
- That's in the middle of nowhere.  - Hawaii's been amazing.

558
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:50,090
对我们这部剧来说简直太太完美了
It's the perfect, perfect set for our show.

559
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,062
-你们岛在那边  -我真的很喜欢这里
- That's your island.  - I've really enjoyed that.

560
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:55,037
剧集的大部分场景都在外景拍摄
So much of the show is shot outdoors.

561
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,085
那些山都很美
It has incredible mountains.

562
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:59,047
气候非常宜人  但是说变就变
The weather can be beautiful, but it can turn.

563
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:02,083
-雨说来就来说走就走  -雨马上就停  Hugo
- You can have incredible rain. - Storm's about to pass, Hugo.

564
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,079
有时也会有惊涛骇浪
The sea can be treacherous.

565
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,000
有时候会很惨很惨  泥巴会没过你的脚踝
It can be really, really tough. You're in mud up to your ankles,

566
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,062
有时还要在阳光下暴晒很久
or you just spend a ton of time in the sun.

567
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,099
但是剧组都非常非常敬业
And, you know, the crew has just been absolutely amazing.

568
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,068
很多时候我都不知道
I mean, there have been days where I just don't know

569
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:17,047
那些设备都是怎么搬进搬出的
how the equipment gets in and how the equipment gets out.

570
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,069
非常不容易  但是很值得
It's not easy, but it's worth it.

571
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:22,004
很美是吧  不论你在岛上待了多久
Beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend

572
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,085
你永远不会厌倦欣赏这些美景
on the island, you just never get tired of this view.

573
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,059
风景成了剧中的一个角色
This landscape is a character in the show.

574
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:25,099
Michael Emerson扮演Benjamin Linus

575
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,063
我不知道何时才能再来
I don't know when I'll ever work

576
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:33,061
像欧胡岛这样美的环境拍戏了
in as magical an environment as I have done here on Oahu.

577
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,046
在长达121小时的剧集中
In 121 hours of the series,

578
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:39,051
差不多只用到了夏威夷群岛的四处场景
all but 4 scenes were shot in the hawaiian islands.

579
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:42,002
回过头看  我觉得我们相当出色
Just looking back, I think we did pretty good job

580
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:44,008
剧情需要拍摄全球各地的场景
Being sort of all over the world

581
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:46,026
而我们都在夏威夷这就拍了
And shooting everything right here in Hawaii.

582
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,079
您是第一次来突尼斯吗  -不是
- Is this your first time in Tunisia?  - No.

583
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,042
从演员角度看  给我设计的剧情
From the acting point of view, that kind of production design

584
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:55,088
-有75%的打斗场景  -欢迎来到爱荷华
- is like, to me, 75% of the battle. - Welcome to Iowa.

585
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:58,039
而事实上他们在这里就能拍摄各地场景
And the fact that they manage to do it here, you know,

586
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,063
在檀香山市中心搭建德国和东欧的场景
in downtown Honolulu, to create Germany, Eastern Europe...

587
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:06,019
真不可思议  让角色们
The mind boggles. It was very daring

588
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:08,058
在全世界到处活动真是非常大胆
to allow characters to move between those worlds.

589
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:11,005
你父亲同意了

590
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,022
在美国电视剧历史上
In the history of American television,

591
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,061
还从来没有一部电视剧
we've never had a television show

592
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:21,091
在42分钟剧集中只有一半时间有字幕
with half of 42, you know, minutes being subtitled.

593
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,020
这是给你的

594
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:26,075
这上边列举了一些简单英文单词的读法

595
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:29,042
每个韩国人都懂一点英语
Every Korean person understands some words of English.

596
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,015
我踩到了该死的海胆
I stepped on a friggin' urchin!

597
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:37,014
当我听其他人对白的时候  我的任务是
You know, my task, when I was listening, was to pinpoint

598
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:39,043
尽可能抓住我认为Jin可能明白的词汇
the words that I thought that Jin would understand.

599
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:41,004
你得赶紧往我脚上撒尿  老兄
You're gonna have to pee on my foot, man.

600
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,096
快尿  尿在上面
Just pee! Pee on it!

601
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,089
-不  不  -快尿
- No! No!  - Pee on--

602
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:48,004
这样使得他能够理解这些词汇
So that he could hook onto those words

603
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,060
并让他能够与人交流
and give him the appetite to stay in the conversation.

604
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:54,030
Sun与Jin

605
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,047
我觉得那该归类于
I guess that falls under the category

606
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,097
"小心你想要的"
of "Be careful what you wish for."

607
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,097
你听懂了
You understood me.

608
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:03,023
你听懂了  对不对  你明白我所说的
You did, didn't you? You just understood what I said.

609
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:05,065
Sun很神秘
Sun was this mysterious,

610
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:09,071
非常传统  有时甚至逆来顺受
very traditional, um... even submissive at times,

611
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:12,072
但她陷入了一场糟糕的婚姻当中
Um, who was sort of trapped in a horrible marriage.

612
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:15,064
我去哪你都得跟着我

613
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,080
听明白了吗

614
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:21,026
这个人对他老婆非常刻薄  他只说韩语
This guy was really mean to his wife. He only spoke Korean

615
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,073
并不是一个好交往的人
and just was not a very pleasant guy to be around.

616
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:26,025
我当时想  我都不知道我是否能做到
And I thought, well, I don't know if I wanna do this.

617
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,075
很高兴我做到了
I'm so glad I did.

618
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:30,086
扮演这个角色挺有意思的
It's been so much fun playing her...

619
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:34,071
-怎么了  -我已婚了
- What's wrong?  - What's wrong is I'm married.

620
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:38,074
一直跟进了解她的所有秘密  非常有趣
And keeping up with her and all of her secrets.

621
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,009
尽管有语言障碍与婚姻冲突
Despite language barriers and marital strife,

622
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:43,075
但岛上的生活将Sun和Jin拉得更近
life on the island brought Sun and Jin closer,

623
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,091
并给他们带来了对新生活的期望
and offered them hope for a new chapter.

624
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,022
你怀孕了
You're pregnant.

625
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,063
这个孩子是  我的吗
Is the baby... mine?

626
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:57,066
他的故事发展非常鲜明
His evolution has been pretty marked

627
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:59,044
也非常有意义
and pretty significant.

628
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,010
我知道我过去

629
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,003
是个什么样的人

630
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:07,050
我会不惜一切保护你和孩子

631
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,017
我好爱你

632
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,097
无论他们是否幸福
Whether they were happy or unhappy,

633
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:16,008
我认为这都是个引人注目的爱情故事
it was the love story that I think a lot of people cared about.

634
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,001
有时候真的很滑稽
It was almost comical for a little while.

635
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,096
克服了种种困难  翻越了重重障碍
You know, every possible obstacle you could throw in the way

636
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,055
两个人的心终于回到一起
of two people getting back together.

637
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,020
你不希望他走  是吧
You don't want him to go, do you?

638
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,043
是的
No.

639
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:27,073
结果却只能隔岛相望
We were gonna be islands apart,

640
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:30,054
甚至相隔几十年的时空不得相见
And then we were gonna be literally decades apart.

641
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:35,007
Sun和Jin分开了两季多
Having Sun and Jin be apart for a good two seasons

642
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:37,071
不仅是在空间上分开  在时间上也是
not only in space but time,

643
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,093
我相信让他们两个重逢
I think it really drew the- the viewers

644
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,087
有个完美的结局
to root for them to get back together

645
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,017
一定会吸引观众的眼球
and have a happy ending.

646
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:46,066
他们充满信心  一定能找到对方
They had a lot of faith in each other and themselves

647
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:50,081
但是Sun和Jin并不是唯一一组
To keep searching. But Sun and Jin were not the only survivors

648
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:52,049
被分开的幸存者
to find themselves separated.

649
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:56,011
差不多每一季的结尾
At the end of... almost every season,

650
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:58,041
他们都会设法把大家分开
they would split up the tribe somehow.

651
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,071
你们要想活  就得跟我走
If you wanna live, you need to come with me.

652
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,029
我想第一次重大的分离是
I guess our first big split

653
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,069
一些人想住在洞里
was some people were gonna live in the caves

654
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:06,027
而另一些人想待在海边
and some people were gonna stay on the beach.

655
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:10,006
"出岛纪"那集中  一些人乘木筏离开了
And then "Exodus", some people go off on a boat,

656
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:12,095
另一些人则徒步去找"黑岩号"
and some of us go marching to "the black rock".

657
00:28:12,095 --> 00:28:15,070
第二季开始之后的很长一段时间里
And for a long time, at the beginning of season 2,

658
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,088
感觉好像我们在做两部不同的剧
it was like we were working on two different shows.

659
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:19,066
而最终  你们也知道
And then eventually, you know,

660
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,072
大家又重逢了  又都在一起了
they rejoined us and then we're back together again.

661
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,083
正像剧中角色那样
Like our characters on the show,

662
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:27,007
我们从全世界各个地方
we were, uh, we were brought here from all over the world

663
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,068
相聚于这美丽的夏威夷群岛
to this beautiful Hawaii island, and...

664
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,089
我们成了最好的朋友
we became best of friends.

665
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:33,031
因为我们曾一起乘船出行
Because we were sailing on this ship together

666
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:36,023
大家和睦相处  对彼此越来越了解
and it was doing well, and--and we were just getting

667
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:38,027
随着我们的关系逐渐加深
to know each other. As our relationships deepened,

668
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:40,030
我感觉我们成了一家人
I felt like we became family.

669
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,040
有很多片段
Those closing montages that we had a lot

670
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,064
镜头从大家身边走过
where you just kind of pan across everybody,

671
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:49,022
看到Sayid扔苹果  我往外倒鞋里的沙子
and Sayid throwing the apple, and I'm shaking sand out of my shoes--

672
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:52,035
这些都是美好的瞬间  说明"我爱大家"
Those are nice "I love these guys" Kind of moments.

673
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:07,090
我很可能是对信仰最感兴趣的人
I'm probably most intrigued by faith.

674
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,092
我很喜欢参演那些
I like being on a show

675
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:11,028
以信仰为主题的剧目
that just talks about faith as a general idea,

676
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,082
关于非常非常相信某事
About just really, really believing in something.

677
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:19,025
关于将对信仰的热忱付诸于实践
About having heart enough to step forward physically in faith.

678
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,030
为什么你觉得这么难相信
Why do you find it so hard to believe?

679
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,039
-为什么你觉得这么容易  -绝不容易
- Why do you find it so easy?! - It's never been easy!

680
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,013
Loche说"我是相信信仰的人
I mean, Locke said, "I'm a man of faith.

681
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,035
你是相信科学的人"  我总是觉得
You're a man of science. " I always thought

682
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:29,092
他只是在拼命地追求信仰
he was a man that was desperately seeking faith,

683
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:33,044
而并不是真正有信仰
not that he had faith.

684
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,093
我认为驱动他的是他需要有信仰
I mean, I think what drove him was the need for it.

685
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:39,002
如果他能找到有关联的事物
If he could simply find something to connect to,

686
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,059
能够把握住的事物
something to hold on to,

687
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,012
我觉得他一直在追求这些
and I think that's what he was always after.

688
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,062
Locke寻求关联的欲望在他发现
Locke's desire for connection was never more evident

689
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:47,001
地上那个舱门之前  从未那样强烈过
than when he found a hatch in the ground

690
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,022
他相信它将解开所有迷
And believed it held all the answers.

691
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,070
我已经完成了你要我做的一切
I've done everything you wanted me to do.

692
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:55,038
那你为什么还要这样  为什么
So why did you do this?! Why?!

693
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,045
当那一束光从舱门照出来的时候
When the lightbulb went on in the hatch,

694
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:02,005
我觉得那太奇妙了  真的
I mean, I just thought that was brilliant, actually.

695
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:05,014
一直以来都在铺垫"舱门到底是什么"
You know, you had this whole buildup as to "What is this hatch?"

696
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:08,068
紧接着一束光照出来  下面有人在走动
And then a lightbulb goes on and somebody walking around down there.

697
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:09,066
那人是谁
Who is that man?

698
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:15,051
早在大洋航班坠机之前很多年Jack就遇见过他
It was a man Jack met years before the Oceanic crash.

699
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,031
Jack
Jack.

700
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,036
我叫Desmond
I'm desmond.

701
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:21,076
祝你好运  兄弟  新生活中再见
Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah?

702
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,015
当我最初加入《Lost》剧组时
When I first worked on "Lost",

703
00:30:24,016 --> 00:30:26,016
我不太了解这部剧
I didn't really know anything about the show.

704
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,075
他们给我看了几集
And they gave me some episodes to watch,

705
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,069
我知道了我将扮演舱里那个人
and I realized that I was gonna be the man in the hatch.

706
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:33,057
放下枪  否则我打爆他脑袋  兄弟
Lower your gun, or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!

707
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:37,068
但我其实并不知道它将发展到多大程度
But I didn't really realize how big it was gonna be.

708
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:39,008
是你
You?

709
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:41,056
这部剧涉及了全世界各地
The show had sort of taken off around the world.

710
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,005
你真的要相信他吗
You're gonna take his word for it?

711
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:45,020
我们只知道他所说的  Jack
His word is all we have, Jack.

712
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:47,051
你大可不必相信我的话
You don't have to take my word for it.

713
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,080
看片子吧
Watch the film.

714
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,041
这个舱是有达摩组织建造的
The hatch was one of many research stations

715
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,068
众多研究站之一  上世纪70年代
built by the Dharma Initiative, a group of scientists

716
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,058
致敬![印度合十礼]  达摩计划

717
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:58,088
一批科学家来到该岛
Who came to the island in the 1970s

718
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:00,050
来研究这里奇妙的特性
to study its unique properties....

719
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:02,036
那种独特的电磁波动
unique electromagnetic fluctuations.

720
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:04,079
Desmond负责每108分钟按动一次按钮
Desmond was charged with pushing a button

721
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,040
用来控制岛上蕴含的
every 108 minutes to keep a massive amount

722
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:10,001
巨大电磁能量
of electromagnetic energy contained.

723
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,012
您不会经常看到他出场
You don't really see very much of him.

724
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:14,070
不会了解他的方方面面
You know, you don't know everything about him,

725
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,020
我觉得这让他更具魅力
which always makes him more attractive, I think.

726
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,034
Desmond是个非常有意思的角色
Desmond's a very, uh, a very interesting character

727
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:23,073
在《迷失》的世界里  他是个常量
within the world of "Lost. " I mean, he's the constant.

728
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:27,009
另外Desmond还是大洋号空难的原因
Desmond was also the reason for the oceanic crash.

729
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:30,000
他耽误了向计算机输入代码
He neglected to enter the code in the computer

730
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,038
此时恰逢815航班飞经该岛
just as flight 815 was passing over the island.

731
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,067
因此当Locke执意终止按动按钮之时
So when Locke chose to stop pushing the button,

732
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:39,061
Desmond意识到问题严重了  
Desmond knew the situation was serious.

733
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:40,098
你要害死我们了
You killed us all.

734
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,004
我喜欢Desmond的是
What I like about Desmond

735
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:45,076
对于他认为正确的事情
is that he always seems to be doing the best he can

736
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:47,050
他似乎总会倾尽全力
to do what he thinks is the right thing.

737
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:52,044
Desmond转动安全开关炸毁了天鹅舱
Desmond turned a fail-safe key to destroy the hatch...

738
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,032
避免了一场全球浩劫
And prevent a global catastrophe.

739
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:59,017
灾难中他活了下来  -嘿  伙计
He survived the ordeal. - Whoa, dude.

740
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:01,023
我在这样的丛林里醒过来
I woke up in the jungle like this.

741
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,002
那  天鹅舱把你内裤也炸飞了?
Like, the hatch... Blew off your underwear?

742
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,089
起初那段时间拍摄的确乐趣很多
Yeah, it was a lot of fun working in those early days,

743
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,081
而且Desmond的戏份
And we've come a long way

744
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:13,054
伴随了我们很长时间  -嘿  在这呢
with the character of desmond. - Hey! Over here!

745
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,076
幸存者随即在丛林中遇到另一个人
The survivors soon met another man in the jungle.

746
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:20,027
我叫Henry Gale  来自明尼苏达
My name is Henry Gale! I'm from Minnesota!

747
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:23,081
起初的计划是给Henry Gale三集的戏份
The original deal for Henry Gale was to be three episodes.

748
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,046
Rousseau把他困在了丛林里
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

749
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:27,094
-她认为他是个"其他人"  -什么"其他人"
- She believes he's an other. - An other what?

750
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:29,067
这个神秘人物
This mysterious man

751
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:31,068
应该就是"其他人"的一员
was presumed to be one of the others--

752
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:33,088
小岛的土著
The island's original inhabitants

753
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:36,072
他们与大洋航班幸存者之间时有冲突
who often clashed with the oceanic survivors.

754
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:40,004
你不会总是知道如何演绎一个人物
you don't always know exactly how to play a role

755
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,099
当你作为友情嘉宾出演时
when you come in as a guest player...

756
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:43,041
当然  如果我是他们一伙的...
Of course, if I was one of them--

757
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:46,054
那些被你们认为敌人的人...
These people that you seem to think are your enemies...

758
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:48,071
但对于这个角色我的确可以驾驭
But this one I had an instinct for.

759
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:51,042
很快我就上手了
I knew kind of what to do with it right off the bat.

760
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:54,000
我会派他们藏到一个隐秘的地方
I'd drawn 'em out to a real secluded place.

761
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,021
当你们的人到那里时  就会落入我们的埋伏
And when your friends got there, a bunch of my people

762
00:32:56,021 --> 00:33:00,034
接着他们就会用你们的人来换我
Would be waiting for 'em, and then they'd use them to trade for me.

763
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,028
所以我不是"其他人"是件好事吧
I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh?

764
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,054
你们有牛奶吗
You guys got any milk?

765
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,039
可结果证明Henry正是"其他人"的一员
As it turned out, Henry was one of them,

766
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,098
我叫Benjamin Linus
My name is Benjamin Linus, and I've lived on this island

767
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:15,016
打出生就住在这个岛上
All my life.

768
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:18,004
Benjamin Linus是"其他人"的首领
Benjamin Linus was the leader of the others,

769
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,028
为了保护小岛他会做任何事
And he would do anything in his power to protect the island.

770
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:24,088
演绎Benjamin Linus这个角色的妙处
Well, what's fun to play with Benjamin Linus

771
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,044
就在他的飘忽不定
Is the uncertain middle.

772
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,044
不打算交易吗
You're not gonna shake?

773
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:32,028
我的角色要经常挨揍
I get to be a-a vulnerable character.

774
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,008
Tom  一分钟内要是听不到我的声音
Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute,

775
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:36,027
就把他们三个都杀掉
Shoot all three of them.

776
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:42,008
但有时我必须要极端的冷酷无情
But I also get to be sometimes quite ruthless and cold.

777
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:44,024
Jack  十分遗憾
I'm so sorry, Jack.

778
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:53,059
本来我一直认为让人揍自己是Ben
I'd always thought that Ben used taking a beating as a tool

779
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,077
为了获取那些揍他的人情报的一种手段
To gain information about the people that were beating him.

780
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,053
-你失去了谁吗  -你知道我失去了什么
- Did you lose someone? - You know what I lost!

781
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:02,097
我可以冒昧的说在电视史上
I would venture to say that I am the most beaten character

782
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:04,036
我是挨揍做多的角色
in the history of television.

783
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:08,084
所以挨揍也就成了我每天的重头戏
So that's been a big part of every working day.

784
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,088
我特别嫉妒其他的演员
I'm so jealous of the other actors, who, you know,

785
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:15,063
涂点防晒霜  再把头发弄乱
they put a little sunscreen on and mess up their hair,

786
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,079
然后就可以拍戏了
And they're ready for work.

787
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:23,067
而我总得早早到片场
I always have to come in early to get

788
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:27,057
刀口  瘀青  伤痕通通都要弄在身上
these cuts and bruises and wounds and stuff put on me. Uhh!

789
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:30,024
在Ben脑海里  这是以最小的代价
In Ben's mind, it was a small price to pay

790
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:32,079
获取情报的手段
to get the informational advantage.

791
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:34,004
又见面了
Hello again.

792
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,096
如果这是个普通的角色
If he was anything simple at all,

793
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:39,044
观众恐怕早就厌倦了
the audience would have tired of him before now.

794
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:42,004
登上这条船  顺着3-2-5的罗盘方位
You're gonna take this boat and follow a compass bearing

795
00:34:42,004 --> 00:34:44,051
要是不出错的话
of 3-2-5, and if you do that exactly,

796
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:47,022
你们父子就得救了
you and your son will find rescue.

797
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:49,041
-就这样吗  -绝不食言
- That's it? - Deal's a deal.

798
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,032
编剧们让他在善恶两端
They keep moving him around fractionally

799
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:54,023
不断地游移
on the scale of good and evil.

800
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:58,030
就在观众认为这个人物善恶已定的时候
And just when the audience thinks they have him pinned down

801
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,078
编剧就会笔锋一转
then the writers change it up.

802
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:01,061
你们是谁
Who are you people?

803
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:06,005
我们是好人  Michael
We're the good guys, Michael.

804
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:19,003
在这6季播放过程中
Over the course of six seasons,

805
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:22,051
《迷失》赢得了全球成百上千万忠实粉丝
"Lost" has garnered millions of devoted fans around the world--

806
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:25,013
其中也包括演员本身
Among them, the actors themselves.

807
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:27,021
我看到《迷失》大受欢迎
I watch "Lost" to be entertained

808
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,011
看到它走向观众
and to be drawn into these people

809
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,061
走入他们的生活  也看到围绕它的各种争议
and their lives and what they're challenged by.

810
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,093
我儿子喜欢这部剧
I have a son who loves this show,

811
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:36,055
所以我们一家人一起看
and so we--we watch it together as a family.

812
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:38,078
我现在是这部剧的狂热观众
I'm a rabid viewer of the show now.

813
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:41,065
有些演员不看  可我得看
Some actors can't look at the show. I-I have to.

814
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:43,033
像其他每个人一样  无论他们是否说出来
Like everybody else, whether they'll say it or not,

815
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,009
我喜欢看剧中的自己  
I love watching myself.

816
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,068
我绝对是这部剧的粉丝
I'm a fan of the show on a lot of levels,

817
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,030
那种超级粉丝
kind of a clueless fan.

818
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,017
很多电视观众
There are many people at home

819
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,066
要比我理解得透彻
that have it much better figured out than I do.

820
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,038
有的人希望  为了观众着想
There's this expectation that

821
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:55,052
编剧应该将剧情简单化
you have to sort of dumb a show down to the audience.

822
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,092
我们却有些反其道行之  我们多少认为
We kind of went the other way. We sort of felt like,

823
00:35:57,092 --> 00:36:01,028
应当做一部我们真正欣赏的剧集
let's make a show that we would really appreciate as viewers

824
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:04,034
因为观众希望更聪慧  希望引入新事物
That tried to be intelligent, that tried to introduce things

825
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,043
那些基于哲学和物理学的深刻话题
That are sort of heavily thematic, based on philosophy or physics.

826
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:09,096
如果某位编剧特别喜欢Rousseau或Locke的教学
If one of the writers really loved the teachings

827
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:12,091
那为什么不将剧中人物起为
Of Rousseau or Locke, uh, why not name characters

828
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:13,048
哲人的名字呢  
After those philosophers?

829
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:15,019
你是Daniel Faraday[物理学家]吗
Are you Daniel Faraday?

830
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:16,003
Jeremy Bentham[哲学家]  
Jeremy Bentham?

831
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:18,056
Desmond David Hume[历史学家]  
Desmond David Hume?

832
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:19,013
你怎么知道我名字
How'd you know my name?

833
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:22,005
我们特别喜欢精心隐藏剧中的复活节彩蛋
What we do like to do is hide little easter eggs in the show

834
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:23,002
就是为了那些想与我们一起
for the people who want to

835
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:24,044
深入"兔子洞"去看得更细致的观众
go down the rabbit hole with us and

836
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:27,096
为了了解这些哲人的具体情况
look a little bit deeper. To kind of get at the source of who these people are,

837
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:31,038
我们查阅了很多资料  读了很多书
we looked at a lot of the things that we had, ourselves, read.

838
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,024
-《沃特希普高地》  -《绿野仙踪》
- "Watership down. " - "The wizard of oz."

839
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,003
-《螺丝在拧紧》  -《镜中缘》
- "Turn of the screw. " - "The looking glass."

840
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:37,057
现在该看《蝇王》喽
It's "Lord of the flies" time now.

841
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:39,067
Carlton最喜欢的作家之一是Walker Percy
One of Carlton's favorite authors is Walker Percy.

842
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,083
我们也就让Sawyer看他的书了  
Well, we have Sawyer reading walker percy.

843
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,079
你怎么会阅读的
How can you read?

844
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,036
我母亲教我的
My mother taught me.

845
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:47,060
一旦某本书被用作背景素材  我就想看看
A book that is used as a prop- I kind of want to read it, then,

846
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,087
给事物之间制造联系也很有趣
And it's fun to make connections

847
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:53,080
也许这有点书呆子气  不过我乐在其中
Between things--maybe a kind of eggheaded fun, but that's me.

848
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,027
因此无论是史蒂芬·金或《圣经》
So whether it was Stephen King, the bible

849
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,047
又或者是《星战》三部曲
or the "Star wars" Trilogy...

850
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,043
他可以随心所欲地冒出来  
He turns up whenever he wants,

851
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:00,071
就像Obi-Wan Kenobi[星战人物]
like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

852
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:03,035
所有这些迥异的人物
All of these disparate influences

853
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:05,055
都被我们设法拿来支持这部片子
we kind of tried to bring to bear on the show.

854
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:08,097
每次台词中将要提到这些人名的时候
Getting to do those references when they would show up...

855
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,008
-就像是...  每次都很震撼
- that was like a... was always a blast.

856
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,034
绝地武士般神奇
Jedi moment.

857
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,076
Hurley可能是《迷失》的粉丝
Hurley would probably be a fan of the show "Lost."

858
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:20,027
也可能是在《Expose》之后第二喜欢的剧集
It would probably be his second favorite show behind "Expose."

859
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:21,076
《Expose》是什么鬼东西
What the hell's "Expose"?

860
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,027
史上最牛的电视节目
Only the most awesome hour of television ever.

861
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,084
Hurley

862
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:28,051
Hurley在某种程度上是个啦啦队长
Hurley is kind of a group cheerleader in a way.

863
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,081
他要让整个队伍撑到明天
He was about getting the whole group

864
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,065
我赌4个木瓜
just to make it to tomorrow. I bet four papayas.

865
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:36,097
一旦你度过了一关  重点就成了
Once you get past surviving, there comes a point

866
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,023
人们多多少少想找些乐子
where people are gonna wanna be entertained somehow,

867
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,022
我也不知道能有什么乐子  不过我觉得
And I wasn't sure what it'd be, but I felt like Hurley should

868
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:44,017
Hurley总会弄出些花样  创意节目之类的
do something like put together a talent show or something.

869
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:46,041
于是就有了高尔夫比赛  那很有效果
Then the golf game showed up, so that works.

870
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,033
伙计们  要是我们困在这里
Dudes, listen, if we're stuck here,

871
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,077
光想着活下去可不够
Then just surviving's not gonna cut it.

872
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:52,027
我们得想些办法出来
We need some way that we can,

873
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:54,063
-得找点乐子  此前他们告诉我说
- you know, have fun. I was told early, like,

874
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,022
"你这个角色的故事就是
"Okay, here's what we got for your story.

875
00:37:57,022 --> 00:38:01,007
他中了彩票"  -本期的特选号码是42
It's like, he's a lottery winner. "...With the mega number 42.

876
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:04,046
很好  可我的奇幻点在哪儿呢
Okay, great, but what's my "Twilight Zone" Thing?

877
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:09,011
比如我的什么举动每每令他人发出惊呼
Like, where's my twist that makes people go "What?!"

878
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:10,085
起初我还搞不清楚  直到最后我读了剧本
And I didn't get that till I finally read the script

879
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:13,004
剧本里说那组数字毁了他的生活
where the numbers that had

880
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:16,017
最后出现在了舱口上
ruined his life, essentially, end up being on that hatch.

881
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:17,096
停  那组数字是邪恶的
Stop! The numbers are bad!

882
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:20,063
接着又在各处钻出来  时钟
And then just popping up everywhere--clocks,

883
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,066
球衫后背  大黄蜂的里程表
Soccer jerseys, the odometer on the camaro.

884
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,011
这就变得有意思了  不管在哪儿
That became kind of a fun thing just-- just everywhere

885
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,099
都能看到它们出现
That stuff like that shows up.

886
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,064
Hurley总是有些霉运伴着
Hurley kind of always had this cloud over him,

887
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,010
每当有倒霉事发生在Hurley身上
And everything bad that happened to Hurley

888
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,037
或者确切说发生在他身边的人身上
Or that--really, that happened to people around Hurley--

889
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:40,083
他总会埋怨自己  -我真有可能办到
He always blamed himself for. -I could really use a victory.

890
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,051
我们来发动车子  我们来创造自己的运气
Let's get this car started. Let's make our own luck.

891
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:47,082
Dharma的车对他来说堪称一个重大转折
And the Dharma van is kind of a big turnaround moment for him.

892
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:51,020
他摆脱掉了生命中的诅咒
He wasn't gonna let the curse control his life anymore.

893
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,076
-Hurley  -好运就在自己手中
- Hurley! - Make your own luck.

894
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:55,004
根本没有诅咒
There is no curse!

895
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,061
这个死胖子
Son of a bitch.

896
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:03,088
-知道咱一起的哪个场景我最喜欢吗  -哪个
- You know what my favorite scene was together? - Which one?

897
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,040
就是我们一起坐在货车里那场
The one we're sitting in the van,

898
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,031
-我们还搞到了啤酒  -对  没错儿
- And we've got those beers. - Oh, yes!

899
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,049
你正教我英语
And you're teaching me... English.

900
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:10,086
某人还迷上了发音
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

901
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,091
你教我学习
You're teaching me the

902
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:14,031
-那些重要的短语  -对  印象深刻
- important phrases to know. - Yes, that was epic.

903
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:16,062
这条...  裤子...
Those... Pants...

904
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,077
你穿上...  不显胖
Don't make you look... Fat.

905
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,086
女人只需要听三样东西
Only three things a woman needs to hear.

906
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:25,005
能放松一下
To kind of be able to relax and, you know,

907
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:28,079
随便地斜躺着  大家轻松地相互逗着
literally lean back and just have a casual, fun scene

908
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,038
真是让人惬意

909
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,010
什么声音
what's that?

910
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,082
直升机
it's a helopter.

911
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,023
救援到了
Rescue.

912
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:45,036
货船

913
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:45,071
退后
stand back!

914
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:48,093
在岛上经历了90天之后
After 90 days on the island,

915
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:52,035
幸存者第一次跟外部世界有了联系
the survivors made their first contact with the outside world.

916
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,067
Desmond
Desmond.

917
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:55,006
一个女人由岛外一只货船
A woman had arrived

918
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:57,061
来到了这里
from a freighter off the coast of the island.

919
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,041
据说这艘船
The boat was allegedly sent

920
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,094
是由Desmond女友Penny Widmore派来的
by desmond's girlfriend, penny widmore.

921
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:04,044
但取得联系绝非易事
But making contact would be difficult.

922
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:07,005
Dharma一个水下舱
An underwater Dharma station was jamming

923
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,009
屏蔽了岛上发射的所有无线电信号
all the radio signals from the island.

924
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,059
-问题就是我们怎么阻止它  -我来
- The question is, how do we get it to stop? - I'll do it.

925
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:14,074
对我来说  最震撼的一集
For me, the most shocking episode

926
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:17,008
就是关于Charlie之死那集
was the one that dealt with Charlie's death.

927
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:20,034
Charlie显然是个非常招人喜欢的角色
Charlie obviously was a very likeable character.

928
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,001
我不会没事的  Claire
I'll be fine, Claire.

929
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,094
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

930
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,060
他们觉得彼此相识已久
They felt like they'd known each other a lot longer.

931
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:35,044
事情刚刚开始趋于完美
It just evolved into something that was just perfect,

932
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:37,049
却又陷入无比的悲凉
And now, you know, really sad.

933
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,055
Charlie游向了水下舱
Charlie swam to the underwater station

934
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:43,068
关掉了屏蔽信号
And turned off the jamming signal...

935
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,015
使他的朋友们有机会呼救
Giving his friends a chance to call for help.

936
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,096
我是Penelope Widmore
This is Penelope Widmore.

937
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:51,052
-你们如何获取了这一频点  -Desmond
- How did you get this frequency? - Desmond!

938
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,052
你刚才说"Desmond"吗
Did you just say "Desmond"?

939
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:57,030
-是  你是在船上吗  -什么船  我不在船上
- Yeah. Hey, are you on the boat? - What boat? I'm not on a boat.

940
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,036
对于我们《迷失》编剧们来说
One of the hardest things for us to do

941
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:04,008
最艰难的事情之一就是杀掉角色
As storytellers on "Lost" Is to kill characters...

942
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,092
很多时候这些角色都是好人
In many ways these characters are friends.

943
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:14,029
在第三季最后一集我们杀掉Charlie之时
When we killed off Charlie in the season 3 finale,

944
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:17,031
这令我们考虑了很久
It was something that we deliberated over for a very long time.

945
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,064
不是Penny的船
NOT PENNY'S BOAT

946
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:23,098
他的死实在太让人感动  我不得不说
How he died was just so moving, and--and I have to say

947
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:27,077
当我看到Charlie被淹没时留下了眼泪
I was crying my eyes out when I saw Charlie drown.

948
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:30,025
这真是让人心痛  因为每个人都喜欢他
It really hit home, because everybody loved him.

949
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:34,000
这对于每个人都产生了很大的影响  
It affected everyone a lot more than we expected maybe, too.

950
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:37,069
也超乎我们预料  当我们走进剪辑室时
when we actually went into the editing room,

951
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:39,044
Charlie之死的那一刻
the moment when Charlie actually dies

952
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,010
竟是如此令人难过
was this profoundly upsetting thing.

953
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:44,049
像是失去了自己所爱的人  尽管只是拍戏
It felt like losing a loved one even though it was just pretend.

954
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:48,083
嘘  Aaron
Shh. Aaron.

955
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,066
-Charlie让我们得救了  -喂
- Charlie just got us rescued. - Hello?

956
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,084
随着屏蔽信号的解除
With the signal cleared,

957
00:41:56,032 --> 00:41:58,024
呼救电话终于有了回应
the call for help was finally answered.

958
00:41:58,037 --> 00:42:01,016
我是大洋815航班的幸存者之一
I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815.

959
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:04,085
-你能否确定我们的方位  -当然可以
- Can you get a fix on our location? - Hell, yeah, we can!

960
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:27,023
松糕把我手给烫了
I burnt my hand on my muffins.

961
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,036
从片子的角度来说
I'm interested in the ways that relativity is an issue

962
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:33,096
我对事物之间相对性的形式很感兴趣
in our show point of view.

963
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,047
这哪儿是什么文学  也就是快餐
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

964
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,046
什么
Excuse me?

965
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,089
真实只是从某个角度呈现出来
Reality presents itself from one angle,

966
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:44,028
假如你换个角度换个距离再观察的话
but then if you step to the side or you pull the lens back,

967
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,080
你会意外发现根本不是那么回事
Then suddenly you see it differently.

968
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:48,047
我倒是觉得自由意志
Here I am, thinking that free will

969
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:51,061
仍然还存在于...
still actually exists on...

970
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:54,070
六季的《迷失》告诉我们
Six seasons of "Lost" have taught us

971
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,068
不是每件事物都是起初看起来那样
that not everything is what it initially appears to be.

972
00:42:58,062 --> 00:43:00,061
当别人问起我这部剧时我都会说
I always to say to people when they ask me about the show,

973
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,099
眼见的并不总为事实
what you see is not necessarily what you get.

974
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:04,095
对前三季来说
For the first three seasons,

975
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:06,077
角色的闪回揭示了
character flashbacks explored the lives

976
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,018
大洋航班幸存者们
of the oceanic survivors

977
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:09,091
坠机之前的生活
before they crashed on the island.

978
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:13,082
但在我们认为的一次闪回中
But everything changed when Jack, in a time of crisis,

979
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:17,015
当陷入危机的Jack出现时  一切均改变了
was seen in what was perceived to be a flashback.

980
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:18,031
是我
It's me.

981
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:22,021
等等  别挂  求你了
Wait. Don't- don't hang up, please.

982
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,016
我只是想见见你
I just need to see you.

983
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,003
但当Kate出现时
But when Kate appeared,

984
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,038
《迷失》向未来跃出了一大步
"Lost" took a giant step to the future

985
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:31,033
在大结局之前幸存者们
And shattered the expectation

986
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:33,014
不会离开小岛的希望
that the survivors would not leave the island

987
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,003
也被彻底粉碎
before the end of the series.

988
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:38,037
我们...  本来不应该离开小岛
We... were not supposed to leave.

989
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:40,031
不  我们该离开
Yes, we were.

990
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:43,055
这是剧中第一次利用"闪前"
It was the first in a series of flash-forward storylines

991
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,023
来展现六名幸存者生活的主线
that followed the experiences of six survivors

992
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:51,018
他们在被营救之后称作"大洋六人组"
who found rescue and became known as the oceanic six.

993
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:53,026
"我想知道自己夜里是不是变了
"'I wonder if I've been changed in the night.

994
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:56,029
让我想想  早晨起床我还一样吗"
Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?'"

995
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:59,020
Jack和Kate生活在了一起
Jack and Kate began a life together

996
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:00,098
共同来抚养Claire的儿子Aaron
Raising Claire's son Aaron.

997
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:03,025
作为观众  我们总有这样一种感觉
As an audience, we always got the sense

998
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,084
他们会一起好好相处
that they would be good together.

999
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,086
真高兴你在这里  
I'm so glad that you're here.

1000
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:08,022
和Kate一起的那集
That episode with Kate,

1001
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:10,059
他们两人貌似沉浸于爱河之中
we're they're sort of living in a world where they're in love

1002
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:14,086
-然后一起结婚  -当然愿意  我愿意
- and they're gonna get married... - of course I will. Yes.

1003
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,071
事情看起来相当圆满
Things seemed to be really beautiful,

1004
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,075
但潜伏其下却有件事令Jack纠结
but underneath that is this thing pulling at Jack.

1005
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:21,077
那座遥远的小岛似乎一直在折磨着他
It was like the island was destroying him from afar.

1006
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,026
我认为Jack和Kate之所以纠结不堪
I think Jack and Kate struggled as much as they did

1007
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,029
完全是因为Kate并不是Jack生活的目的
because ultimately Kate was not Jack's purpose in life,

1008
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,061
同时Jack也不是Kate的生活  
And jack wasn't kate's purpose.

1009
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:30,047
你不能这样做
You can't do this.

1010
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,047
是你的问题  你得想想清楚
You have problems. You need to figure them out.

1011
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,063
世间最大的杯具莫过于此:
There's nothing more sad and tragic

1012
00:44:34,075 --> 00:44:36,017
你认为两人
than two people that you really feel

1013
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,042
本应该好好在一起
would have been great together.

1014
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,067
但他们所处的现实情况
But the circumstances that they find themselves in

1015
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:42,034
却无法让他们
doesn't really afford itself to having the opportunity

1016
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,067
幸福地长厢厮守
to make a really good, pure connection.

1017
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,074
这个让Jack和Kate
And the circumstances that led

1018
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:49,024
最终离开小岛的现实就是
to Jack and Kate's eventual departure from the island

1019
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,037
从船上派出的直升机登岛引起的
all began when a chopper arrived from the freighter.

1020
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,053
-你是谁  -我是Daniel Faraday
- Who are you? - I'm Daniel Faraday.

1021
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:57,049
我来这儿是救你们的
I'm here to rescue you.

1022
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:00,059
Faraday是位物理学家  他与一个科学小组
Faraday was a physicist who came to the island

1023
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,002
和飞行员Frank Lapidus一起来到了岛上
with a science team and their pilot, Frank Lapidus.

1024
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:06,011
但营救并非他们的主要目的
But rescue was not their primary mission.

1025
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:08,080
这是Charles Widmore  
This is Charles Widmore-

1026
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,011
他的船就停在岛外水域
the man whose boat is parked offshore.

1027
00:45:10,037 --> 00:45:13,007
Charles Widmore曾经是"其他人"的首领
Charles Widmore was once the leader of the others

1028
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:15,091
直到被Ben驱逐出岛
before he was banished from the island by Ben.

1029
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,070
小子  后会有期
I'll be seeing you, boy.

1030
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:19,076
Widmore计划复仇
Widmore sought vengeance,

1031
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:21,095
因此派出货船来岛
so he sent the freighter to the island,

1032
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,038
船上有一干雇佣兵来抓捕Ben
which also carried a team of mercenaries to capture Ben.

1033
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:28,025
走吧  雀斑女  我可在这破地儿待够了
Let's go, freckles. I've seen enough of this rock.

1034
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:32,038
Jack和Sawyer引领一班人向Widmore的船进发
Jack and Sawyer led a group to widmore's freighter...

1035
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:34,062
但是直升机却燃油泄漏
But the chopper began leaking fuel.

1036
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:37,078
要是我们能轻个几百磅
I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we were

1037
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:39,007
我可就感觉舒服多了
a few hundred pounds lighter!

1038
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:40,025
嘿
Hey.

1039
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:42,089
这样Sawyer做了个重大决定
So Sawyer made a fateful decision.

1040
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:45,031
我不知道Kate和Sawyer俩人
I wonder how much of a relationship

1041
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,004
究竟该是个什么关系
Kate and Sawyer were supposed to have.

1042
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:50,059
首播那集当我俩拍手枪那个场景时
In that pilot when we did that little gun scene

1043
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:51,087
我把她拉到身前  
and I pulled her in close...

1044
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:53,039
我跟你这样的妞儿相处过
I've been with girls like you.

1045
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:56,055
他们都在说  喔  还真来电
They were all talking about, oh, the chemistry there.

1046
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:58,050
不知道是那个场景给了他们灵感
I don't know if that gave them any ideas

1047
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:00,032
还是他们早已计划好了一切
or if they had all that planned already.

1048
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:02,041
在这破岛经历了这一切之后
After all we've been through on this damn island,

1049
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:06,008
我们不该享受下美好生活吗  我总觉得
don't we deserve somethin' good? I always felt, in their flaws,

1050
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:07,063
他们同是天涯沦落人
they were well-matched.

1051
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:09,057
不过共患难让他们
But there is a sort of sweetness about two people

1052
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,078
命运纠缠在一起
who know how to stumble together,

1053
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:15,004
而并非是双宿双栖
as opposed to two people who know how to fly together.

1054
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,047
Sawyer
Sawyer!

1055
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:22,070
对一个角色来说那有多英勇  
how heroic is that for a character?

1056
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,066
绝对的英雄
That was extremely heroic.

1057
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:25,047
有人要说  "我们会成功的"
A guy that would say, "You know, we're not gonna make it."

1058
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:26,037
我喜欢  -我跳了
I loved it. - "I'm jumping.

1059
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:27,055
"实际上就如同Josh的真实生活
" Just like Josh in real life, actually.

1060
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:31,056
没错啊  我喜欢那样  我只知给予
It is. I'm--I'm like that. I'm a giver.

1061
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:33,077
Sawyer设法游回了小岛
Sawyer made his way back to the island,

1062
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:37,051
此时Ben已经逃离了雇佣兵
where Ben had escaped the mercenaries...

1063
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:38,090
谢谢你过来  Richard
Thank you for coming, Richard.

1064
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,088
并下入一个地下洞窟
and descended into an underground cavern

1065
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,087
试图最后保护小岛
in a final attempt to protect the island.

1066
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:47,002
直升机到了Widmore的船
The chopper reached Widmore's freighter,

1067
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:49,044
可船上却被装上了炸药
but it was rigged with explosives.

1068
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,036
你要去哪儿  我们得走了  
Where you going? We gotta go.

1069
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:51,013
Jin和Michael还在下面
Jin's below with Michael.

1070
00:46:51,027 --> 00:46:52,060
不  不  没时间了
No, no, there's no time. There's no time.

1071
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,068
-我们必须走了  -我不会离开他的
- We have to go. - I won't leave him!

1072
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,093
每次我俩分别的时候都令我难忘
Every time we get separated, it is memorable to me

1073
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,042
因为我总会想  会不会这次就是永别了
because I often think, well, maybe this is it.

1074
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:01,061
不  是Jin
No! It's Jin!

1075
00:47:01,075 --> 00:47:02,097
我觉得
I think it was

1076
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:04,082
这是我拍摄最艰难的场景之一
one of the hardest scenes I had to shoot.

1077
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,060
我的双手在颤抖
My hands were shaking.

1078
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:20,036
不  别掉头
We're not! Turn back!

1079
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:22,087
Sun  Sun  Jin已经死了
Sun! Sun! Jin's gone.

1080
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:26,062
那有可能是他们最后一次相见
That might be the last time they see each other,

1081
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,098
所以是非常有意义的  也是Sun相信Jin
so it was significant, and significant for sun

1082
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,024
已经死了的标志
in that she believed that jin was dead.

1083
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:35,000
Lapidus  掉头飞回岛上去
Lapidus! Fly us back to the island!

1084
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:36,079
随着货船的爆炸
With the freighter destroyed,

1085
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:38,064
直升机只能原路返回
the chopper made its way back,

1086
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:42,011
同时Ben Linus也转动了神秘的转盘
just as Ben Linus turned a mysterious wheel,

1087
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,077
这座岛
causing the island...

1088
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:46,011
消失了
to vanish.

1089
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:48,042
岛去哪儿了
Where the hell's the island?!

1090
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:52,032
不行了  我们快没燃料了
That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

1091
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:10,039
-你回来干什么  -我想洗个澡
- What are you doing here? - I decided to take a dip.

1092
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,069
不过我希望人们能记住《迷失》的
But I hope "Lost" is mainly remembered

1093
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,020
人物塑造
as a character-driven show...

1094
00:48:14,037 --> 00:48:17,042
-你庆祝什么呢  -我没庆祝
- Whatcha celebratin'? - I'm not celebrating.

1095
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:19,085
处理人性问题的方法
That dealt with human issues...

1096
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,047
-那个是我们的船吗  -曾经是
- Is that our boat? - It was.

1097
00:48:22,076 --> 00:48:26,040
采用的不同视角真的能让你大开眼界
That really opened your mind to different perspectives

1098
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:28,004
甚至你以前想都没想过
that you hadn't thought of before.

1099
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:29,036
我预想过
I have a sneaking suspicion

1100
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:30,068
这部电视剧会是独一无二的
that it might stand alone.

1101
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,019
如果10年  15年或者20年过后
I wouldn't be surprised that if you look back on it, you know,

1102
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,053
你再看一次的话我也不会惊讶  还会说
10, 15, 20 years from now and say,

1103
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:39,011
-那是过去的电视剧  -John  欢迎回来
- "That was kind of a one-time thing." - " Hello, John. Welcome home."

1104
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:42,019
就所创造的这个世界来说  你可以逃避现实
In terms of creating a world that you can escape in,

1105
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:43,086
我指的是逃避现实的电视剧
you know, I mean, escapist television--

1106
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,052
我觉得没有比这个还好的
I don't think it gets any better than this.

1107
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:56,012
有人吗
Anyone?!

1108
00:48:56,075 --> 00:48:58,026
时间旅行

1109
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,084
当Benjamin Linus转动转轮移动小岛时
When Benjamin Linus turned the wheel to move the island...

1110
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:05,076
他在传送的途中
he was transported halfway around the world

1111
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:06,099
被传到了突尼斯沙漠
to the tunisian desert,

1112
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:10,011
然后他就开始联系已经获救的
and he began making contact with the oceanic six,

1113
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:12,060
-大洋六人组  -你好  Hugo
- who had already found rescue. - Hello, hugo.

1114
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,087
不过还在小岛上的Locke  Sawyer  Juliet
But back on the island, Locke, Sawyer, Juliet

1115
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:17,050
还有剩下科学小组成员
and the remainder of the science team

1116
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:19,051
开始了时间旅行
began flashing through time.

1117
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,015
在一次时间旅行时
and during one flash...

1118
00:49:22,036 --> 00:49:23,083
-Jin  -Sawyer
- Jin? - Sawyer?

1119
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:26,045
他们发现Jin还活着
They found jin very much alive.

1120
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,098
-我们得回到兰花站  -你说什么
- We have to go back to the orchid. - Excuse me?

1121
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,029
那是一切开始的地方
That's where all this started.

1122
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:31,048
也许也是能终止一切的地方
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

1123
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,030
所以Locke再次转动了转轮
So Locke turned the wheel again,

1124
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:36,098
然后时间旅行就停止了  
And the time flashes stopped.

1125
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,054
我想已经结束了
I think it's over.

1126
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:41,012
-我觉得是John成功了  -现在怎么办
- I think John did it. - Now what?

1127
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,002
现在我们就等他回来
Now we wait for him to come back.

1128
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,049
达摩营地 1974

1129
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,090
在Locke转动转轮后
After Locke turned the wheel,

1130
00:49:46,004 --> 00:49:49,039
Sawyer和Juliet就被留在了1974年
Sawyer and Juliet were left stranded in 1974.

1131
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:51,060
一起留下来的还有Jin和Miles
And with Jin and Miles,

1132
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,067
他们都加入了达摩组织
they joined the Dharma Initiative.

1133
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:56,019
用装土豆的袋子做成的连身衣非常搞笑
That potato sack of a jumpsuit was hilarious, man.

1134
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:59,037
你必须每天都得穿着它  你就像是  好吧
You come put that on every day. You're like, wow. All right!

1135
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:01,057
我认为那时候的人都有鬓角
And I think dan had the big sideburns.

1136
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:05,019
我喜欢  在70年代生活也很有意思
I liked it. It was fun to be '70s, you know?

1137
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,003
晚上好  boss
Evening, boss.

1138
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:08,096
Sawyer成了保安队的队长
Sawyer became head of security,

1139
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,060
Juliet当上了机修工
Juliet was a mechanic...

1140
00:50:10,098 --> 00:50:12,007
闻起来真香
Somethin' smells good.

1141
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:15,015
-两人也相爱了  -是送给我的吗
- And the two fell in love. - Is that for me?

1142
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:19,074
不过鉴于Kate和我用了三年时间建立的关系
Whereas Kate and I had three years to earn that relationship,

1143
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:21,003
他们给了我们两种剧本
They gave us two scenes.

1144
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:24,096
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you, too.

1145
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,022
但是我看了  我十分确信
But I watched it, and I was convinced.

1146
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:31,001
我几乎马上就支持了Sawyer和Juliet的剧本
I was rooting for Sawyer and Juliet almost immediately.

1147
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:32,001
我是说  Sawyer
I mean, Sawyer--

1148
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:34,063
当暴风雨过去  他和Juliet谈话的那晚
when he was talking to Juliet at night after the big storm,

1149
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,065
有点像倾诉关于Kate的心事
you know, sort of pouring his heart out about Kate.

1150
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:38,062
你为什么不现在告诉我呢
Why don't you tell me now?

1151
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:41,001
我无意识的就在想
I involuntarily in my head was thinking,

1152
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:43,090
吻她  吻她
Kiss her! Kiss her!

1153
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:46,044
Locke的旅程

1154
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:50,025
在转动转轮之后  Locke被传送到了
After turning the wheel, Locke was Transported

1155
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:52,069
3年后的2007年
3 years in the future to 2007.

1156
00:50:53,043 --> 00:50:55,023
他开始寻找大洋六人组
He began searching for the oceanic six

1157
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,043
让他们相信他们必须回到岛上去
to convince them to return to the island.

1158
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:00,008
-我是不会回去的  -答案是  不回去
- I'm not going back. - The answer is "No."

1159
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:02,067
-不  我哪儿都不和你去  -别来找我
- No, I'm not going anywhere with you! - You leave me alone,

1160
00:51:03,082 --> 00:51:05,074
你也别再去找他们
And you leave the rest of 'em alone!

1161
00:51:07,048 --> 00:51:11,011
Locke失败了  当他失去希望的时候
Locke had failed, and when he lost all hope...

1162
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:14,079
等等  John  停
Wait, please! John, stop.

1163
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:17,009
Benjamin Linus找到了
Benjamin Linus saw a chance

1164
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:19,058
重新当上小岛首领的机会
to reclaim his role as the leader of the island.

1165
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:21,033
你是  你在这干什么
Who--what-- what are you doing here?

1166
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:24,010
那天在那个地方有一种很特殊的干劲
There was a special energy in the room that day.

1167
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:25,013
John  冷静  
John, just calm down.

1168
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:26,007
你到底想从我这得到什么
What do you want from me?

1169
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:28,003
-先让我把话说完  -回答我的问题
- Please, let me talk. - Answer the question!

1170
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:32,030
我一直希望Terry能演一场很棒的戏
I always expect Terry to play a great scene,

1171
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:36,013
不过那天他入戏太深了
but he went somewhere further and darker that day.

1172
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,034
我不知道我们能从那去哪儿
I don't know where we go from there,

1173
00:51:37,048 --> 00:51:39,008
不过我们会弄明白的  
But we'll figure something out.

1174
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:40,001
镜头非常犀利
Focus becomes very sharp.

1175
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:42,077
因为这个原因那天也非常紧张和有意思
It was an intense and really fun day for that reason.

1176
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:47,025
我知道我们要去哪儿  在洛杉矶有个女人
I know where we go. There's a woman here in Los Angeles--

1177
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,066
叫Eloise Hawking  
Eloise Hawking.

1178
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,011
Eloise Hawking  你确定
Eloise Hawking? You sure?

1179
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:51,093
对 怎么了  你认识她  
Yeah. Why? Do you know her?

1180
00:51:51,093 --> 00:51:53,065
没错  John  我认识她
Yes, John. I know her.

1181
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,071
我会想念你的  John  真的会想你的
I'll miss you, John. I really will.

1182
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:09,074
我会说那是我面对镜头以来
I would say it was the most intense day's work

1183
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:11,008
工作的最紧张的一天
I ever did in front of the camera.

1184
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:14,082
Locke死去的消息深深的影响了Jack
The news of Locke's death profoundly affected jack

1185
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,055
同时也刺激他
and was the catalyst

1186
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:18,061
做出决定返回小岛
in his decision to return to the island.

1187
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:20,016
那里发生了一些事
There was something happening there

1188
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:22,045
甚至与Jack自己都没什么关系
that didn't even have to do with Jack himself.

1189
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:25,090
而是有关他的信念  他和Locke之间的斗争
It had to do with his faith- that whole battle

1190
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:28,094
还有他打算做的事情
with him and Locke and what he's meant to do.

1191
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:32,033
因为他的自由意志他没办法放下那些念头
He cannot let go of the notion that he has free will,

1192
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:34,000
与此同时  这也在不断的摧毁着他
and at the same time, it's destroying him.

1193
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:36,035
他说我必须要回去
He said that I had to come back.

1194
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:39,081
你们所有人都必须要回去
All of you have to go back.

1195
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:42,024
我们也要带他一起回去
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

1196
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:47,066
Jack和Ben两人都想回到岛上去
Jack and Ben both wanted to return to the island,

1197
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:49,052
所以他们找到了一个方法
so they found a way.

1198
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,034
Ajira航线  一条航班为3-1-6
Ajira airways flight 3-1-6.

1199
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:55,099
大洋六人组开始了他们回归的旅程
The oceanic six began their journey back.

1200
00:52:56,097 --> 00:52:57,094
对于Kate来说  
For kate,

1201
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:59,098
是一次让Claire和Aaron团聚的机会
it was a chance to reunite Claire with Aaron.

1202
00:53:00,066 --> 00:53:02,058
Shephard先生  你和死者的关系是
Mr. Shephard... Your relation to the deceased?

1203
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:04,045
他  是我的一个朋友
He was, uh, a friend.

1204
00:53:05,054 --> 00:53:07,060
为了重现当时航班的飞行条件
To recreate the conditions of the original flight,

1205
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,019
John Locke的尸体也被带上了飞机
the body of John Locke was brought on the plane.

1206
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:15,089
在大洋的高空
High over the pacific... Aah!

1207
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,025
一道道强光横扫航班
A series of flashes swept through the plane.

1208
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:20,039
那是跑道吗
Is that a runway? !

1209
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,076
最后一个引擎也停了  我们要进行迫降
Massive instrument failure! We're puttin' her down!

1210
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:25,068
坚持住
Brace for pact!

1211
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:33,023
Lapidus  Sun还有Ben降落到了现在的2007年
Lapidus, Sun and Ben landed on the island in present day 2007.

1212
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:35,000
-Frank  -他们去哪儿了
- Frank? - Where'd they go?

1213
00:53:35,017 --> 00:53:36,003
他们不见了
They're gone.

1214
00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:41,021
但是Jack  Kate  Hurley还有Sayid
But Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid...

1215
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:45,018
则到了30年前的这座岛  1977年
returned to the island 30 years earlier in 1977...

1216
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:48,083
-Jin  -和Jin还有Sawyer重聚了
- Jin? - And were reunited with Jin and Sawyer.

1217
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:49,094
难以置信
I can't believe it!

1218
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:54,057
你们为什么穿着以前达摩组织的连身衣
So what's up with you guys in the old Dharma jumpsuits?

1219
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:58,042
我们加入了达摩组织  现在是1977年
We're in the Dharma Initiative. It's 1977.

1220
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:01,069
大家一起说"致敬"  "致敬"
Everybody say "Namaste. " Namaste!

1221
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,061
Sawyer带他们进入了达摩组织
Sawyer ushered his friends into Dharma society.

1222
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:06,058
别忘了试试这个蘸酱
And don't forget to try the dipping sauces.

1223
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,071
他们还做火腿  
They really bring out the ham.

1224
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:10,014
Daniel Faraday也成了70年代
Daniel Faraday was also a member

1225
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:12,056
达摩组织的成员
of the 1970s Dharma Initiative...

1226
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:14,068
-你好  James  -他花费了他所有的时间
- Hey, James. - And he spent his days

1227
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:18,007
来找到能阻止大洋815航班
trying to find a way to prevent the crash of oceanic 815

1228
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:21,099
-坠毁的方法  -在天鹅站工地的那些人
- from ever happening. - The Dharma folks at the Swan Worksite--

1229
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:23,034
他们要钻探地下
they're gonna drill into the ground

1230
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:24,085
然后他们会偶然挖到
and accidentally tap into a

1231
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:27,019
-巨大的能量区  -Daniel Faraday说
- massive pocket of energy. - Daniel Faraday says,

1232
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,018
如果我们引爆一颗氢弹
if we can detonate a hydrogen bomb,

1233
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:32,032
地下的巨大电磁能量
this massive amount of electromagnetic energy that

1234
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:34,092
那个供研究用的铁舱就会没有用
that hatch is being built to study will be negated.

1235
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:36,062
那个铁舱就不会被造出来
And that hatch will never be built,

1236
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:39,053
你们的飞机就会降落到它的目的地
and your plane will land, just like it's supposed to.

1237
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,078
他的想法鼓舞了Jack
His idea inspired Jack.

1238
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:44,045
当Faraday被杀后
And when Faraday was killed...

1239
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,070
Jack就去完成了这次任务
Jack carried out the mission.

1240
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:48,019
他们认为这颗炸弹就像是复位按钮
They think that the bomb is like a reset button.

1241
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:51,004
815航班的乘客就回到飞机上
The passengers of flight 815 will be back on the plane,

1242
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:53,078
他们就会从悉尼飞到洛杉矶
they'll be flying to Los Angeles from Sydney,

1243
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:55,084
他们的生活还会继续
and their lives will go on

1244
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,091
就好像这次坠机没有发生过
as though there never was a plane crash.

1245
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:00,042
但是这颗氢弹没有爆炸
But the bomb did not detonate...

1246
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,094
这里看起来可不像是洛杉矶机场
This don't look like L.A.X.

1247
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,065
巨大的电磁能能量
And a surge of electromagnetic energy... uhh!

1248
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,038
困住了Juliet
Aah! Had Juliet trapped.

1249
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:12,048
-Juliet  -不
- Juliet! - No! Aah! Ohh!

1250
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:14,044
你以为你能去哪儿  金发妞
Where do you think you're going, blondie?

1251
00:55:14,074 --> 00:55:18,087
那是非常棒的一场戏而且也是很好的拍片经验
That was quite a scene and a great experience to film.

1252
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:21,003
-别留下我一个人  -没事的
- Don't you leave me. - It's okay.

1253
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:22,031
别留下我一个人
Don't you leave me!

1254
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:25,083
很艰难的决定  但是是值得的
Tough stuff, but it was- it was rewarding.

1255
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:29,015
我爱你  James  非常非常爱你  
I love you, James. I love you so much.

1256
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:31,071
不  不  别放手
No! No, don't let go! Aah!

1257
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,070
Juliet
Juliet!

1258
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:35,077
我感觉结束了
I feel like it rounded out

1259
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,040
真的以我们的关系
and really honored that relationship we had

1260
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:41,010
或者是角色中我们的爱情为荣
or the love that we shared as characters.

1261
00:55:44,023 --> 00:55:46,006
Juliet引爆了氢弹
Juliet survived the bomb...

1262
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:48,067
完成了他们开始的任务
And finished what they'd started.

1263
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:53,038
爆炸啊  快啊
Come on! Come on!

1264
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,014
爆炸啊  狗娘养的
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1265
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:10,056
最大的疑问就是
as we move into the final season of the show is,

1266
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:13,040
Juliet引爆那颗氢弹的结果是什么
what is the consequence of Juliet tapping that bomb?

1267
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,029
所以在第六季的开始
So at the beginning of the sixth season,

1268
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,045
我们是从大洋815航班开始的
we start on oceanic flight 815.

1269
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:23,012
看上去好像氢弹起了作用
And it appears that the bomb has actually worked,

1270
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,070
我们的乘客也正飞向洛杉矶
and our passengers are flying to Los Angeles.

1271
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:28,024
-好像我们没事了  -当然没事了
- Looks like we made it. - We sure did.

1272
00:56:28,037 --> 00:56:30,001
可是  我们开始认识到
However, we start to realize

1273
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,024
这一群人和我们最初看的
that there are subtle differences

1274
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:34,004
电视剧中的那些飞机上的人
between this group of people and what we saw initially

1275
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:36,026
你真的不应该告诉别人
You know, you really shouldn't tell people

1276
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:38,058
-你中了彩票  -谢谢你的提醒
- you won the lottery. - Thanks for the advice, dude,

1277
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:40,045
不过还没有什么坏事发生在我身上
but nothing bad ever happens to me.

1278
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:42,003
我是最幸运的人了
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

1279
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:44,008
在《迷失》里  我们采用了闪回
On "Lost," We've had flashbacks

1280
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:45,084
然后有闪现了未来
and then we had flash-forwards,

1281
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:47,036
现在在最后一季的节目里
and now in the final season of the show

1282
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:49,091
-我引入了平行世界  -有什么不对吗
- we have these things called flash sideways. - Something wrong?

1283
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:53,050
没有  没有  我以前在哪见过你吗
No. No, you just... do I know you from somewhere?

1284
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:56,008
-我也不是很确定  -有很长一段时间
- Well, I'm not sure. - For so long,

1285
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:58,023
这些人的故事都是基于一个想法
these people's stories have basically been governed

1286
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:00,029
这个想法就是这座岛把他们召唤过去的
by this idea that the island is pulling them to it.

1287
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,095
我们今年想要讲述的故事
We wanted to tell stories

1288
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,088
是出于一个非常特殊的原因
for a very specific reason this year

1289
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,085
这座岛其实并没有起到作用
where the island was not in play.

1290
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:08,009
这一次  小岛沉没了
This time around, the island has sunk.

1291
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:09,080
它现在处于大洋的海底
It is now on the bottom of the ocean.

1292
00:57:10,084 --> 00:57:12,060
所以在815航班的乘客
And so the passengers of flight 815--

1293
00:57:12,072 --> 00:57:14,076
他们正从悉尼飞到洛杉矶的路上
they're flying to Los Angeles from Sydney

1294
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,040
就好像从来没发生过坠机
as though there never was a plane crash.

1295
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,032
当我们看见飞机
When we actually saw the plane

1296
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:22,046
真的平安降落到洛杉矶机场的时候  我有点
land safely in "L.A.X.," I was just like,

1297
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,040
非常非常的激动
it was--it was very emotional.

1298
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:29,015
从飞机上走下来太有意义了
Walking off the plane was so significant.

1299
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:31,008
他们没事了
Wow! They made it.

1300
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,041
然后我们的大脑就一直在说
And our brains are telling us,

1301
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:36,016
这是怎么回事  是不是因为
okay, how did this happen? Did it happen because

1302
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,017
那个氢弹炸沉了小岛才会这样的
the a-bomb went off and it actually sunk the island?

1303
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:42,045
-又或者是发生了其他什么事情  -有人吗
- Or is there something else going on here? - Hello?!

1304
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,020
在那之后不久
then shortly after that,

1305
00:57:44,032 --> 00:57:46,048
我们就看到了这些人还在岛上
we see our characters are on the island,

1306
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,083
他们引爆了氢弹  可是没起作用
and they've detonated the bomb, and it didn't work.

1307
00:57:50,024 --> 00:57:53,015
-不  -他们一下又回到了"现在的小岛"
- No. - They get jumped to what we call "Island present,"

1308
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,095
不过他们还是被困在了岛上
but they are still stuck on the island.

1309
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,053
你把我们又炸回到了最开始的地方
You blew us right back where we started!

1310
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:59,028
对不起  我以为会起作用的  
I'm sorry. I thought it would work.

1311
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:00,003
没起作用
Well, it didn't!

1312
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:02,029
所以观众就要去适应这一切
So the audience is left trying to reconcile,

1313
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,021
我们会不会
how is it that we can be watching one story

1314
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:06,014
是在看这些人在岛上
in which our characters are on the island

1315
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:08,092
-深度昏迷时候的一个故事  -是你干的
- and they're in a state of deep misery... - You did this.

1316
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:11,034
我们也看的是这些人
And we're also watching a story in which our characters

1317
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,007
在洛杉矶降落下飞机的故事
are landing in Los Angeles, getting off the plane.

1318
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:15,054
然后我们这些观众就向想知道
and so we as an audience are wondering,

1319
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:18,021
-为什么会有这些差别  -非常感谢
- why do these differences exist? - Thank you so much.

00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:26,090
谢谢  -Kate仍然是一名逃犯

1325
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,018
不过很快就逃脱了
and quickly makes her escape. Uhh! Ohh!

1326
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:34,005
穿好你的衣服  Jim

他们能再找到其他人吗

他们还会影响到其他人的生活吗

如果没有这座岛的介入

00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:24,060

和一个你一点都不认识不了解的人
It's really cool having these moments with somebody

1365
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,024

1366
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,041
不过你会马上就信任他
But you just immediately trust

1367
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,044
-甚至你自己都不知道是为什么  -在平行世界
- and you don't even know why. - In the sideways,

1368
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:19,053
Kate感觉到了她和这个孕妇之间
Kate feels this strange connection with this woman,

1369
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:21,050
有一种奇怪的联系  她想要帮她
This pregnant woman. She wants to help her.

1370
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:22,053
情况很好
Everything is just fine.

1371
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:25,032
你的孩子就是想换个姿势而已
Your boy just likes to move around.

1372
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:26,054
对于我来说
The prospect of that,

1373
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:28,040
对孩子的期望会让我很兴奋
for me, was really exciting.

1374
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:32,040
我喜欢挖掘"如果…将会怎么样"的想法
I loved the idea of exploring the "What if?"

1375
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,078
-John Locke丢了工作  -伙计
- John Locke lost his job... - Dude!

1376
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,033
有引向了另一段联系
Which led to another connection.

1377
01:00:36,054 --> 01:00:38,056
结果是Hurley
Hurley, it turns out, is actually the owner

1378
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:40,020
就是John Locke
of the very company that John

1379
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,096
-所工作的公司的老板  -我开了一家中介
- Locke has been working for. - I own a temp agency, too.

1380
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:45,015
而Hurley则反过来给了John Locke
And Hurley, in turn, gets John Locke a job

1381
01:00:45,028 --> 01:00:48,018
在这个学校一份代课老师的工作
as a substitute teacher at this school.

1382
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,036
有一些老师则是非常熟悉的脸孔

1383
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:52,059
最明显的就是Benjamin Linus  
Most notably Benjamin Linus.

1384
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:53,040
我觉得我们没见过
I don't believe we've met.

1385
01:00:53,064 --> 01:00:56,005
-John Locke  代课老师  -欢迎
- John Locke. Substitute. - Well, welcome.

1386
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:58,088
还是和现实之间
there's little moments of bleed through

1387
01:00:59,024 --> 01:01:02,004
-有一些渗透  -也许应该让你来当校长
- between the realities there. - Maybe you should be the principal.

1388
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:05,049
有好几次Ben都以为
There have been times when Ben thinks

1389
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:09,050
以前在什么地方见过他  到底是什么呢
he knows this guy from somewhere. What is it?

1390
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:11,077
你不记得我了  是不是
You don't remember me, do you?

1391
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:13,046
我应该知道你是谁吗
Should I?

1392
01:01:13,072 --> 01:01:16,004
这一季会让你来演绎
It kind of gives you a little something new

1393
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:17,056
一些新的东西
to play this season

1394
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:20,067
当扮演他们的时候
In kinda getting to see the other sides of people

1395
01:01:20,082 --> 01:01:21,092
就会看到他们另一面
as they played them.

1396
01:01:22,004 --> 01:01:23,067
比如说Sun  解开
For sun, the whole buttoning

1397
01:01:23,082 --> 01:01:26,008
系上毛衣的扣子
the sweater and unbuttoning it--

1398
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:28,020
在Sun和Jin的平行世界中
She sort of takes that full circle

1399
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:30,062
她有点像在绕圈子
in Sun and Jin's flash sideways--

1400
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:33,002
在Jin的面前脱下毛衣
You know, taking off that sweater right in front of Jin

1401
01:01:33,014 --> 01:01:34,095
引诱他
to seduce him.

1402
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:36,082
可是当Sun的父亲发现她的秘密之后
But when Sun's father uncovered her secret,

1403
01:01:36,097 --> 01:01:39,027
他就雇人来杀掉Jin
he hired two men to kill Jin.

1404
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:43,031
Jin击败了他们
Jin defeated them.

1405
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:47,031
但是Sun却在交火中中枪了
But Sun was caught in the crossfire.

1406
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:51,040
尽管Sun中枪了
Although sun was shot...

1407
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:54,022
可是一切看起来都还很好  而且
everything seems to have turned out okay, and currently,

1408
01:01:54,037 --> 01:01:56,048
她恰巧也是和其他人在同一家医院
she's convalescing in the same hospital

1409
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,096
慢慢回复健康
where a number of our other characters happen to be.

1410
01:01:59,013 --> 01:02:00,046
-你想怎么样  Jim  -好吧
- What is your deal, Jim? - All right,

1411
01:02:00,046 --> 01:02:02,042
听着  我和她一起出去  你别来烦我
look, I go out with her, you gonna leave me alone?

1412
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:05,058
在平行世界中  Sawyer的生活中
In the sideways, Sawyer is a little bit at a loss

1413
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:08,010
在女朋友的事情方面有些不知所措
in his own life in terms of his romantic interests,

1414
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:10,027
Miles则一直试着给他介绍女朋友
his partner, is trying to fix him up

1415
01:02:10,045 --> 01:02:12,073
什么人都有  包括Charlotte
with various people, including Charlotte,

1416
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:14,037
也是我们在岛上见过的
who we met on the island.

1417
01:02:14,055 --> 01:02:15,092
很高兴见到你  女士
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

1418
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,062
但是Sawyer却搞砸了
but then Sawyer kind of blows that up.

1419
01:02:17,098 --> 01:02:20,066
当他继续着警察生活的时候
As he's going about his life and duties as a cop...

1420
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:25,032
Kate Austen又闯进了他的生活
who runs into him again but Kate Austen.

1421
01:02:27,016 --> 01:02:28,045
然后他抓了Kate Austen  
And he takes Kate Austen

1422
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,009
并把她关进了拘留所
and he locks her up in jail,

1423
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,044
他还是和她有一种奇怪的联系
and yet he's still got this strange connection with her,

1424
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:33,060
可是他却不是很明白是怎么回事
and he doesn't really quite understand it.

1425
01:02:33,071 --> 01:02:35,095
洛杉矶有那么多车  你偏偏撞到了我的车
Of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine.

1426
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,028
感觉就像有人非要把我们凑到一起
Almost like someone's trying to put us together.

1427
01:02:38,072 --> 01:02:40,010
你在和我调情吗
Are you hitting on me?

1428
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:42,018
但是Kate并不是
But Kate isn't

1429
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:43,077
唯一一个吸引Sawyer注意力的人
the only one who captured Sawyer's attention.

1430
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,007
一个自动取款机的监控录像
An A.T.M. Surveillance camera

1431
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:48,032
拍到了这个人从犯罪现场逃走的画面
grabbed this jaboney fleeing the scene.

1432
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:50,082
好的  那他叫什么名字
All righty. And the name of that face?

1433
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:52,091
Sayid发现了自己卷入了
Sayid finds himself in a set of circumstances

1434
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,005
犯罪活动的事实
where he gets involved in some criminal activity.

1435
01:02:57,004 --> 01:03:00,037
还是一个与暴力密切相关的角色
It's still a character that's, uh, near to violence.

1436
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:02,053
就像是相似的命运困住了他
Somehow the same destiny seems to have trapped him.

1437
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,092
结果  他逃跑的时候发现自己
As a result, he goes on the run and finds himself

1438
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,037
是被Sawyer和Miles追捕的
being pursued now by Sawyer and Miles.

1439
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:09,060
Jarrah女士  我是探员Straume  
Mrs. Jarrah, I'm detective Straume.

1440
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,018
所以换句话说
So in another way,

1441
01:03:10,032 --> 01:03:12,063
我们发下这些角色都是互相有联系的
we find that our characters are all connecting.

1442
01:03:12,063 --> 01:03:14,036
在我们看来我们所做的
We do seem to be that the sum total

1443
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:16,085
-那些决定的实质是有联系的  -你被捕了
- of the choices that we make. - You're under arrest.

1444
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:20,081
那些特定的选择能导致很多种结果
Certain choices are invariably full of consequence,

1445
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,071
其中的一些结果是非常有害的
and some of those consequences can be quite damaging.

1446
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:24,080
先生  您是医生吗
Sir, you're a doctor?

1447
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:26,031
-是的  -您能跟我来吗
- Yes. - Could you come with me, please?

1448
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:28,019
平行世界中还有一个角色
There's one character in the

1449
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:31,000
-就是Charlie Pace  -他没有呼吸了
- sideways--Charlie Pace... - He's not breathing.

1450
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:33,088
由于他想要藏起来的一小袋
who basically is choking on this bag of heroin

1451
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:36,033
海洛因差点让他窒息  他说他有了一次
That he is trying to conceal. He says that he had

1452
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:39,062
濒死体验  他看见了他所爱的人的画面
a near-death experience, and he saw this image of love.

1453
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:45,008
一个女人  金色头发  非常漂亮
A woman--blonde, rapturously beautiful.

1454
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,052
我们知道Charlie爱着Claire
We know that Charlie loved Claire.

1455
01:03:46,064 --> 01:03:48,040
在平行世界里  他们从未遇见过
In the sideways, they've never met,

1456
01:03:48,053 --> 01:03:50,048
但他却能描述地如此详细
But he's describing her to a tee.

1457
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,062
这真是有点诗情画意了  兄弟
Well, that's just... poetry, brother.

1458
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:56,032
Desmond为Charles Widmore工作
Desmond works for Charles Widmore...

1459
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:58,027
-欢迎来洛杉矶  朋友  -谢谢
- Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend. - Thank you.

1460
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:00,081
他被派去监督Charlie
And was assigned to be Charlie's chaperone.

1461
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:02,094
你听过一个叫drive shaft的乐队吗
Have you heard of a band called drive shaft?

1462
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,064
不 没听到过
No, can't say I have.

1463
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:07,061
他的生活很空洞  虽然他并没有沮丧
He was leading an empty life. He wasn't depressed,

1464
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,013
但是就是少了些什么
But it was just- there was something missing,

1465
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,076
他知道生活中少了些什么
And he knew there was something missing,

1466
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:11,084
但是他不知道到底是什么
and he couldn't put his finger on it.

1467
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:14,036
Charlie借机让Desmond看了他看到的东西
Charlie took the opportunity to show Desmond what he saw.

1468
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,048
所以Charlie猛转方向盘
So Charlie grabs the wheel.

1469
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,024
他让Desmond的车冲出了码头
He takes Desmond's car off this pier,

1470
01:04:18,036 --> 01:04:19,056
他们掉进了水里
And they go into the water,

1471
01:04:19,075 --> 01:04:23,006
Desmond竭力想把Charlie从车里弄出来
And as Desmond is trying to extricate Charlie from the car,

1472
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,016
Charlie把他的手放到了车窗玻璃上
Charlie puts his hand up against the window,

1473
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:28,064
Desmond突然看到了Charlie死时的片段
And Desmond suddenly has this flash of when Charlie died,

1474
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,097
写在Charlie手上的是"不是Penny的船"
And written on Charlie's hand is " Not Penny's boat."

1475
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:32,075
当然Demond从没有遇见过Penny
Desmond, of course, has never met Penny,

1476
01:04:32,086 --> 01:04:34,069
他没听说过这个名字  但是强烈地
Doesn't know that name, but he has this sort of

1477
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:37,093
感觉到了你无法体会的似曾相识感
profound sense of the most ultimate deja vu

1478
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:40,040
这对他来说意义非凡
you could ever experience. This means something to him.

1479
01:04:40,052 --> 01:04:42,008
Desmond
Desmond.

1480
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:44,088
我觉得我好想看到了什么  我看到了光
And I thought, ah, I've seen something. I've seen the light.

1481
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,018
不过我觉得远远不止这些
But I think it's even beyond that.

1482
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,032
我想他被点通了  
I think he's become more enlightened.

1483
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:48,012
谁是Penny
Who's Penny?

1484
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,003
Desmond醒悟了
Desmond's awakening

1485
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:52,038
计划好了一系列的行动
Set a series of key events in motion.

1486
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,031
两个世界开始移动
These two worlds are starting to move

1487
01:04:54,045 --> 01:04:56,022
渐渐靠近  
A little bit closer together,

1488
01:04:56,036 --> 01:04:58,079
这是因为Desmond Hume有了片刻的觉醒
and the reason is that Desmond Hume had a moment of awareness.

1489
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,099
他在岛上的回忆似乎都回来了
He seems to have some complete and total memory of the island.

1490
01:05:02,008 --> 01:05:04,008
你能帮我弄到悉尼那趟航班的旅客名单吗
Can you get me the manifest from our flight from Sydney?

1491
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,027
大洋815号  
Oceanic 815.

1492
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,086
我能问一下要来干嘛吗
Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?

1493
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:12,018
我只是想让他们看点东西
I just need to show them something.

1494
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,028
在《迷失》的最后一季 
During the final season of "Lost"...

1495
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:27,017
快跑  快跑
Run! Run!

1496
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:32,029
岛上的事情越来越虚幻
The story on the island dove deep into mythology

1497
01:05:32,043 --> 01:05:34,024
而且越来越神秘  
And explored its great mysteries.

1498
01:05:34,025 --> 01:05:37,007
想知道一个秘密吗  Jack
You wanna know a secret, Jack?

1499
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,007
我很久很久以前就知道的一个秘密
Something I've known a long, long time?

1500
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:41,016
我们不在岛上  从来没有
We're not on an island. We never were.

1501
01:05:41,093 --> 01:05:43,039
我们在地狱里
We're in hell.

1502
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:47,022
我12岁的时候就认识他了
I've known him since I was 12 years old.

1503
01:05:47,035 --> 01:05:49,033
他那时候的样子就和现在一样
Richard looked just like he does today.

1504
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:50,069
我开始看出一些端倪
I started to get an inkling

1505
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:53,073
他很特别  比我想象中还特别
That he was a little different than- -than I'd imagined,

1506
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:57,029
我发现他不会变老的时候知道的
Um... I guess when I found out that he didn't age.

1507
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,034
这到底是怎么回事
And how the hell do you think that happened?

1508
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:01,032
很久以来  看剧的观众一直想知道
For a long time, people on the show wondered,

1509
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:03,020
Richard Alpert有什么故事
What is the story with this guy Richard Alpert?

1510
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,065
这家伙不会变老
The guy doesn't appear to age.

1511
01:06:04,078 --> 01:06:06,059
他好像涂了睫毛膏
It looks like he's wearing mascara,

1512
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:08,081
-画了眼线  -这跟他不会变老有关系吗
- uh, eyeliner. - Are these two things related?

1513
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,083
-有没有关系  -是啊
- Are they related? - Yeah.

1514
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:11,089
我们确定的是  首先
And we learned definitively, number one,

1515
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,044
他没有画眼线
He is not wearing eyeliner.

1516
01:06:14,087 --> 01:06:18,061
Richard Alpert的闪回真是让人激动不已
The flashback with Richard Alpert was killer.

1517
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,053
我想每个人都喜欢那集  当然我也是其中之一
I think everyone loved that, and I was right in that crowd.

1518
01:06:21,068 --> 01:06:24,042
Alpert是19世纪60年代
Alpert was a poor field-worker

1519
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:26,075
加那利群岛上贫困的农民
in the canary islands of the 1860s.

1520
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:27,095
我去请医生

1521
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,097
那是一段古装戏  我的意思是  
It was a period piece. I mean,

1522
01:06:31,006 --> 01:06:32,064
在"迷失"里这段就像一部迷你片
it felt like a mini movie within the context of "Lost."

1523
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:34,086
洋溢着古典的主题和元素
And it had sort of classic themes and elements.

1524
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:38,075
一系列悲惨的事件导致了Alpert的被捕
A series of tragic events led to Alpert's arrest.

1525
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,087
他被卖作了奴隶
He was sold as a slave

1526
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:44,025
禁闭在前往新世界的一艘船上
And confined on a ship bound for the new world.

1527
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,038
船开往了小岛
The vessel was drawn to the island

1528
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,013
在凶猛的暴风雨中船化作了碎片
And shipwrecked during a violent storm.

1529
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,003
很多年来  观众一直在想
For many years, the audience has been wondering,

1530
01:06:53,015 --> 01:06:55,042
黑岩号怎么会在丛林中间的
How the heck did that ship get in the middle of the jungle?

1531
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:58,023
在这一集里  我们就能知道原因了
And in this episode, we actually finally learn what happens.

1532
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:01,021
备受折磨地过了六天
After six torturous days,

1533
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:03,050
黑衣人把Alpert放了
Alpert was freed by the man in black...

1534
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:05,066
很高兴看到你摆脱枷锁
It's good to see you out of those chains.

1535
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:08,078
但很快他成了黑衣人和Jacob拉锯战中的棋子
But soon became a pawn in his age-old war with Jacob.

1536
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:11,006
我不知道他们会真的
I didn't know that they would really go

1537
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:13,039
在这集里挖得这么深
Into the depths that they did with this--with this episode,

1538
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:14,047
我真的不知道
And I certainly didn't know

1539
01:07:14,056 --> 01:07:16,034
这集会和迷联系在一起
That the episode would be tied to the mythology.

1540
01:07:16,052 --> 01:07:18,013
我叫Jacob
My name is jacob.

1541
01:07:18,027 --> 01:07:22,076
Alpert成了Jacob的顾问  因此得来了永生
Alpert became Jacob's advisor in exchange for eternal life.

1542
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:25,052
我很高兴  不仅因为我参与其中
I was thrilled when I got to not only partake in that

1543
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:28,090
还因为作为捞饭我能知道岛上发生了什么
But also just learn as a fan about what was at play on the island.

1544
01:07:28,095 --> 01:07:31,095
把这酒想做你们说的地狱
Think of this wine as what you keep calling hell.

1545
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:33,061
邪恶  魔鬼
Malevolence. Evil.

1546
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:35,001
瓶塞
The cork...

1547
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:38,046
是这个岛  也是唯一一个
Is this island, and it's the only thing

1548
01:07:38,056 --> 01:07:40,083
能禁锢住邪恶的东西
Keeping the darkness where it belongs.

1549
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:43,073
初识Jacob和黑衣人的时候
When you're first introduced to Jacob and the man in black,

1550
01:07:43,082 --> 01:07:46,020
我们会觉得也许他们是上帝和恶魔
Our assumption is, maybe they're the god and the devil,

1551
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:48,061
他们代表了正与邪  但他们到底是什么呢
Maybe they're good and evil. Who are these guys exactly?

1552
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,061
而我们最近才知道  他们是人
And we recently learned, well, they're guys.

1553
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:52,002
要知道  他们是有故事的人
You know, they have a history

1554
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:54,007
就像这个剧里的其他角色一样
Just like any other character on the show.

1555
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:56,086
Jacob和黑衣人是两兄弟
Jacob and the man in black were brothers,

1556
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:59,034
很久以前出生在岛上
Born on the island a very long time ago.

1557
01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:02,005
他们由一个妇女抚养长大
They were raised by a woman

1558
01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:04,011
那个妇女是小岛的保护者 
Who was the protector of the island.

1559
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:05,024
这是什么地方
What is this place?

1560
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,004
这是我们待在岛上的原因
This is the reason we're here.

1561
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:10,060
男孩长成了大人  他们被灌输了一个观念
The boys grew into men and were led to believe

1562
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:12,014
岛外什么都没有
There was nothing beyond the island.

1563
01:08:12,014 --> 01:08:13,057
Jacob我要走了
I'm leaving, Jacob.

1564
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:15,086
不  那不可能  根本没有出岛的路
No, that's impossible. There is no way off the island.

1565
01:08:16,015 --> 01:08:19,055
最后Jacob被选作了新的守护者
Eventually, Jacob was chosen as the new protector...

1566
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:22,068
现在你和我一样了
Now you and I are the same.

1567
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:25,059
而黑衣人发现他被骗了
And the man in black learned he'd been deceived.

1568
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:29,019
最后  这酿成了莎士比亚式的悲剧
And eventually, this builds to this great sort of shakespearean tragedy

1569
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:32,036
黑衣人杀了自己的母亲
In which... The man in black kills his own mother.

1570
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:35,004
你想离开这里吗  兄弟  那你走吧
You wanna leave this place, brother?! Then go!

1571
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,051
Jacob抓住了黑衣人
And Jacob takes the man in black

1572
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,027
把他丢进了神秘的洞穴中
And throws him down into this mysterious cavern,

1573
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,014
之后黑烟就出现了
And the monster emerges.

1574
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:47,009
这就是
this is the origin of

1575
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:48,069
黑衣人变成黑烟的起源
how the man in black turned into the smoke monster.

1576
01:08:48,088 --> 01:08:51,014
成了黑烟之后  
Once he is the smoke monster,

1577
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:52,084
它只能变成岛上死去的人的样子
he only can assume the form of dead people on the island.

1578
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:55,083
黑衣人变过Christian Shephard
The man in black appeared as Christian Shephard.

1579
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:59,048
他最多的变成了John Locke的样子
He most notably takes the form of John Locke.

1580
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:01,060
很高兴见到你挣脱那些枷锁
It's good to see you out of those chains.

1581
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:03,060
黑衣人同样也可以
But the man in black can also take the form

1582
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:06,073
变成自己的样子  要离开小岛
Of his own corporal body. To leave the island,

1583
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,070
黑衣人必需杀了Jacob
The man in black had to kill Jacob,

1584
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:11,093
但是受规则所限他自己杀不了Jacob
But rules prevented him from doing so himself.

1585
01:09:12,008 --> 01:09:14,032
-让我走吧  Jacob  -只要我还活着
- Just let me leave, Jacob. - As long as I'm alive,

1586
01:09:14,032 --> 01:09:15,056
你哪也去不了
you're not going anywhere.

1587
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:17,084
我会杀了你的  Jacob
I will kill you, Jacob.

1588
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:19,064
即使你杀了我  也会有人代替我的
Even if you do, somebody else will take my place.

1589
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:21,064
那我把他们也杀了
Well, then I'll kill them, too.

1590
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:25,020
接班人

1591
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:26,073
你不会再偷东西了  是吗
you're not gonna steal anymore, are you?

1592
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:28,036
乖乖的  小Kate
Be good, katie.

1593
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:30,036
我们可以从闪回中看到基本上
We see in flashbacks that basically

1594
01:09:30,048 --> 01:09:33,008
在幸存者过去的生活中
Jacob has touched our plane survivors

1595
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,070
Jacob都去接触过他们  
In their past lives.

1596
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:35,070
选择权在你  Hugo
It's your choice, Hugo.

1597
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:38,036
Jacob的触摸让他们免于死亡
Jacob's touch protected them from being killed

1598
01:09:38,051 --> 01:09:41,036
并把他们列入了接班人的行列
And marked them as candidates to be his successor.

1599
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:43,077
所以黑衣人知道这些接班人是谁
So the man in black knows who the replacements are,

1600
01:09:43,093 --> 01:09:46,013
他知道大洋815号失事后
And he knows when oceanic 815 crashes

1601
01:09:46,027 --> 01:09:48,043
Jacob接班人中的有一些人
That some of Jacob's precious candidates

1602
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:49,072
实际上在那架航班上  
Are, in fact, on that plane,

1603
01:09:49,072 --> 01:09:51,014
所以他开始寻找到底谁会来接班
so he starts to check 'em out.

1604
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:53,069
我们第一次看到黑衣人
We might just have, uh, first been introduced

1605
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:55,054
可能就是在试播集里
to the man in black in the pilot itself.

1606
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,050
他们听到了怪物的叫声
They hear this monster sound-- arrr!

1607
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,075
没错  就是这个声音
Yes. That's exactly what it sounded like.

1608
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:05,014
他第一个找到的其中一个就是John Locke
And one of the first people that he checks out is John Locke.

1609
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:07,009
本剧很早的时候
Very early in the series,

1610
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:08,065
黑烟就对Locke很友善
the monster angles in on Locke,

1611
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,096
而Locke也说他看到了美妙的东西
and Locke says that he saw this beautiful thing.

1612
01:10:13,016 --> 01:10:15,037
也许这就是黑衣人做出决定的时候
Maybe that's the moment when the man in black first decided,

1613
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:18,006
"这就是我要的那个人  我要变成这个人"
"This is my guy. I'm gonna become this guy."

1614
01:10:18,022 --> 01:10:20,060
-你活着  -是的
- You're alive? - Yes, I am.

1615
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:22,038
5季以来我一直不知道
I had all of season 5 not knowing

1616
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:24,036
事实上  我就是那个角色
That I was, in fact, that character.

1617
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:27,029
我演得只是John Locke  而现在恐怕已经不是了
I was just being John Locke, who now wasn't as afraid.

1618
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:29,090
什么  John  你不相信我和我的人了吗
What, John? Don't you trust me here with my former people?

1619
01:10:30,005 --> 01:10:32,042
我再也不怕你做的任何事了  Ben
I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.

1620
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:34,025
黑衣人出现了
The man in black emerged.

1621
01:10:34,038 --> 01:10:36,048
他是一个势在必得的人
This was somebody who was simply gogonna get what he wanted.

1622
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,019
黑衣人万事俱备
The man in black had all the pieces in place...

1623
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:41,067
你好  Jacob
Hello, Jacob.

1624
01:10:41,085 --> 01:10:45,063
最后他蛊惑Ben杀了自己的仇人
And manipulated Ben to finally kill his nemesis.

1625
01:10:50,097 --> 01:10:52,064
现在他正照着他的计划行事
So now he's executed this plan.

1626
01:10:52,076 --> 01:10:54,045
到第二步了
It's time for phase two, which is,

1627
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:56,084
为了能让黑衣人离开小岛
In order for the man in black to leave the island,

1628
01:10:56,095 --> 01:10:59,044
Jaocb所有的接班人都必须死
all of Jacob's candidates have to be dead.

1629
01:10:59,057 --> 01:11:02,037
Ford  你是一个接班人
Ford. You're a candidate.

1630
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:04,003
接什么班
Candidate for what?

1631
01:11:04,013 --> 01:11:07,069
成为新的Jacob守护这座岛
Become the new Jacob and protect the island.

1632
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,053
我们知道Jack也是接班人
And we learn that Jack is a candidate,

1633
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,076
Hurley  死之前的John Locke也是
Hurley was a candidate, John Locke was a candidate

1634
01:11:11,088 --> 01:11:14,005
-没错  -他死了之后
- Before he died. Right. - When you die,

1635
01:11:14,005 --> 01:11:15,091
就不再是接班人了
you're no longer a candidate...

1636
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:18,025
你需要办个记者招待会和所有一切事情
And you have to have a press conference and everything.

1637
01:11:18,036 --> 01:11:20,030
Kwon也是其中之一  
Kwon is one of them.

1638
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,076
这是指我还是Sun
Does that mean me or Sun?

1639
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:25,093
Jin  这我不太清楚  但是它意味着
Well, Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that

1640
01:11:26,006 --> 01:11:28,052
出岛的唯一一条路就是
the only way we can leave the island is if

1641
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:32,063
名字没有被化掉的接班人一起走
all of the names that haven't been crossed off go together.

1642
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:36,014
黑衣人企图操纵我们的接班人
The man in black is attempting to manipulate our candidates,

1643
01:11:36,028 --> 01:11:37,074
而且他努力
And he is trying

1644
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:40,027
营造一个环境可以同时杀了他们
to put them in a situation where he can kill them.

1645
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:44,017
黑衣人招募了Claire和Sayid
The man in black recruited Claire and Sayid.

1646
01:11:44,036 --> 01:11:46,028
他想杀了Desmond
He tried to kill Desmond...

1647
01:11:48,066 --> 01:11:51,001
他进行了大扫荡
And left a path of destruction in his wake.

1648
01:11:52,048 --> 01:11:54,084
黑衣人一系列的精心策划
The man in black's series of calculated moves

1649
01:11:54,095 --> 01:11:56,021
让接班人聚到了一起
brought the candidates together.

1650
01:11:56,087 --> 01:11:59,028
不  他们丢下我们了
No! They're leaving us!

1651
01:11:59,036 --> 01:12:02,045
相信我  你不想登上那个潜艇
No, trust me. You don't wanna be on that sub.

1652
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:03,067
他们上了潜艇
They get on the submarine,

1653
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,040
他们觉得自己自由了  可是突然间
And they think that they're free, but all of a sudden,

1654
01:12:05,052 --> 01:12:07,051
他们发现背包里装的是炸弹
they discover in this backpack is this bomb.

1655
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:08,077
如果我不把导线拔了
If I don't pull these wires,

1656
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:09,086
Locke会把我们炸上天  
Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.

1657
01:12:09,086 --> 01:12:10,037
不  他不会的
No, he's not!

1658
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:14,089
-Locke杀不了我们的  -什么
- Locke can't kill us. - Uh... What?

1659
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,064
他想让我们自相残杀
He's trying to get us to kill each other.

1660
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:18,070
别挡路  医生
Stay out of my way, doc.

1661
01:12:20,072 --> 01:12:24,086
倒数加快了  于是Sayid牺牲了自己
The timer accelerated, so Sayid sacrificed himself.

1662
01:12:28,031 --> 01:12:31,030
但是爆炸把Sun卡住了
But the explosion left Sun trapped.

1663
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:33,065
Jin  快走
Jin, go!

1664
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:36,052
不  走  我会把她弄出来的
No! Go! I'll get her free!

1665
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,016
不  我们能行
No! We can do this!

1666
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:39,069
快走  救Sawyer
Just go! Save Sawyer!

1667
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,038
Jin决定留下来和Sun在一起
The fact that Jin decides to stay with Sun--

1668
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:46,039
对Sun和Jin来说是一个
It was just a very heroic, romantic,

1669
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:48,066
很有英雄气概  很浪漫的结局
You know, ending for Sun and Jin.

1670
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,028
你快走
You have to go.

1671
01:12:50,038 --> 01:12:52,039
我不会离开你的
I won't leave you.

1672
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:56,023
我只是没想到他们让我们分开这么久
I just never expected for them to keep us apart for so long,

1673
01:12:56,049 --> 01:12:58,073
当我们再团聚的时候
and only to have us come together

1674
01:12:58,091 --> 01:13:01,028
差不多就是死的时候
and sort of be united in our death.

1675
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,044
我爱你  Sun
I love you, Sun.

1676
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:04,085
我也爱你
I love you.

1677
01:13:05,025 --> 01:13:08,044
他生活中的第一位就是妻子
His one priority in life was his wife.

1678
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:11,032
这样看来  最后他是牺牲了自己
For that, ultimately, he did sacrifice himself,

1679
01:13:11,043 --> 01:13:12,052
而这对我来说
And that, to me,

1680
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:16,026
就是最好的结局
is as noble an end as anyone could hope for.

1681
01:13:16,045 --> 01:13:18,040
Jin和Sun去哪了
What about Jin and Sun?

1682
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,036
"迷失"的最后一集
As the final chapters of "Lost",

1683
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:47,026
两条平行时间线越来越靠近
two parallel storylines are drawing closer together.

1684
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:50,045
-你也在大洋815号上  -是的
- Were you on Oceanic flight 815? - Yeah.

1685
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,030
-我也是  -哇  真巧啊
- So was I. - Wow. What a coincidence.

1686
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:55,080
平行世界中  Desmond觉得
In the sideways, Desmond decides it's his mission

1687
01:13:55,092 --> 01:13:59,006
出去刺激其他人是他的使命
To go out and basically try to catalyze the other characters

1688
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,032
这样他们也能醒悟过来
So they can have their awakenings.

1689
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:01,085
前几天晚上相亲的时候我见到了一个女的
I met a girl on a blind date the other night.

1690
01:14:01,092 --> 01:14:04,047
她说我们早就认识对方
She told me that we already knew each other.

1691
01:14:04,056 --> 01:14:06,048
那就是我记得了
And that? I'd remember.

1692
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:09,039
她说认识你的时候你相信她吗
Did you believe her when she said she knew you?

1693
01:14:12,062 --> 01:14:14,036
那我告诉你  勇敢地去吧
Then I say, go with your gut.

1694
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:17,012
最后  他与Libby重聚了
Eventually, he is reunited with Libby,

1695
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:18,088
他们约会了
And they go on this date,

1696
01:14:19,003 --> 01:14:20,096
她有一种奇怪的似曾相识的感觉
And she's having this weird sense of deja vu.

1697
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:23,020
她说不出是什么  但是当他们亲吻的时候
She can't quite put her finger on it. But when they kiss,

1698
01:14:23,032 --> 01:14:26,003
Hurley突然记起他们在岛上的情景
Hurley suddenly remembers being on the island.

1699
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:29,030
-老兄  -怎么了
- Dude... - What?

1700
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,006
我想我记起来了
I think I'm remembering stuff.

1701
01:14:31,059 --> 01:14:33,086
现在他好像和Desmond一样了
And he now seems to be exactly like Desmond.

1702
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,026
我们不知道他知道什么了
We don't know exactly what he knows,

1703
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,013
但他确实知道很多了
But he certainly knows a lot.

1704
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:40,035
Hurley觉醒之际  Desmond继续
With Hurley on the road to awakening, Desmond moved on

1705
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:43,027
启发着另一个人
to another person in need of enlightenment.

1706
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:46,020
他撞了坐在轮椅里的John  Locke
He literally runs over John Locke in a wheelchair.

1707
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,063
这在我看来太直接了
That seems pretty direct to me. And--

1708
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:55,048
"警官  我只是在刺激别人的记忆"
"Officer, I was just catalyzing an awakening."

1709
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:57,000
-谢谢  -别客气
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

1710
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:58,069
Desmond向Sawyer自首了
Desmond turned himself over to Sawyer

1711
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:01,059
与Sayid和Kate一同蹲在了监狱里
And joined Sayid and Kate in jail.

1712
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:05,048
不久之后  Hurley安排了他们的越狱
And shortly afterward, Hurley arranged for their release.

1713
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,093
-不好意思来晚了  -别放心上
- Sorry I'm late, dude. - Don't worry about it.

1714
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:09,077
Desmond和Hurley携手并进
Desmond and Hurley are kind of working in tandem

1715
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:12,087
去唤醒其他人
To--to try to help awaken some of these characters.

1716
01:15:12,099 --> 01:15:15,052
你跟他  你跟我
Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.

1717
01:15:15,064 --> 01:15:16,060
我跟你什么意思
What do you mean, I'm with you?

1718
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:18,096
我们
We...

1719
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:21,031
去个音乐会
Are going to a concert.

1720
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:24,056
我想现在关键的是
I think the point is that we all know everything

1721
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:27,098
我们现在了解了自己需要知道的一切
That we already need to know about ourselves right now.

1722
01:15:28,013 --> 01:15:31,001
我们只需要睁大双眼看着
We just need to open our eyes and see it.

1723
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,010
Locke先生  你会没事的
You're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.

1724
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:37,015
Jack发现Locke是他的病人时
When Jack discovered that Locke was his patient...

1725
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,074
我想我认识这个人
I think I know this guy.

1726
01:15:39,018 --> 01:15:41,048
太巧了没法让人不注意
The coincidence seemed too great to ignore.

1727
01:15:41,088 --> 01:15:43,000
出于某种原因
For some reason,

1728
01:15:43,017 --> 01:15:47,018
Jack有一种想治好John Locke的强烈欲望
Jack feels this overwhelming desire to fix John Locke,

1729
01:15:47,031 --> 01:15:48,020
让他能再次行走  
To make him walk again.

1730
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,006
做手术的时候  我看了一下你之前脊柱上的伤
While I was operating, I got a look at the initial injury to your spine.

1731
01:15:51,017 --> 01:15:53,070
我想我可以把你治好
I think that I could fix you.

1732
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:57,046
深思熟虑之后  Locke接受了Jack的建议
After much contemplation, Locke accepted Jack's offer.

1733
01:15:57,062 --> 01:16:00,030
也许发生这一切都是有原因的
Maybe this is happening for a reason.

1734
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:01,091
也许你就该治好我
Maybe you're supposed to fix me.

1735
01:16:02,014 --> 01:16:04,004
有一件事奏效的是
One thing that is really coming into play

1736
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:06,065
人物间开始互相寻求帮助
Is this idea of characters asking for help.

1737
01:16:06,092 --> 01:16:09,016
我想我准备好摆脱这个轮椅了
I think I'm ready to get out of this chair.

1738
01:16:09,033 --> 01:16:11,087
事实上他们能互相帮助
The fact that they are able to help each other

1739
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,068
这似乎让他们的生活变得不同
Seems to make all the difference in their lives,

1740
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:17,063
而这也是两个世界的不同之处
And this is a big difference between the two worlds.

1741
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:19,076
在岛上
On the island,

1742
01:16:19,086 --> 01:16:22,053
剩下的幸存者为他们先行的朋友默哀
the remaining survivors mourned the loss of their friends.

1743
01:16:22,073 --> 01:16:24,026
他们有个女儿  你知道吗
They had a little girl, you know.

1744
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,080
Jin还没见过她
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

1745
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:32,079
这都是Locke造成了
Locke did this to them.

1746
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:36,087
我们要杀了他  Jack
We have to kill him, Jack.

1747
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:41,018
我知道
I know.

1748
01:16:41,037 --> 01:16:44,003
他们想为发生在朋友身上的事报仇
They want to get revenge for what happened to their friends.

1749
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,013
他们想使自己有能力杀了Locke
Um, they wanna be able to kill Locke,

1750
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:47,077
但他们不知道该怎么做
But they have no idea how to do this.

1751
01:16:47,089 --> 01:16:50,056
有人让Jack  Kate  Hurley和Sawyer转移了注意力
Jack and Kate and Hurley and Sawyer get sidetracked

1752
01:16:50,066 --> 01:16:52,064
那人就是Jacob
By none other than Jacob himself.

1753
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,048
我选择了你们因为你们像我
I chose you because you were like me.

1754
01:16:55,065 --> 01:16:57,088
你们都孤身一人
You were all alone.

1755
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:00,075
你们都在寻找
You were all looking for something

1756
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:02,064
那里找不到的东西
that you couldn't find out there...

1757
01:17:03,094 --> 01:17:06,083
也因为你们需要这个地方像它需要你们一样
Because you needed this place as much as it needed you.

1758
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:10,088
小岛新一代守护者向前迈进的时候到了
The time had come for the island's new protector to step forward.

1759
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:13,048
长期以来  Jack一直在寻找一个原因
For a long time, Jack has been searching for the reason

1760
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,012
为什么他被带到这个岛上来
that he was brought to this island and the reason

1761
01:17:16,024 --> 01:17:18,056
为什么他回去之后又回来了
that he came back to this island after leaving it.

1762
01:17:19,016 --> 01:17:20,001
我来
I'll do it.

1763
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,028
他现在确信他到这个岛上来
He now firmly believes that he came to this island

1764
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,053
是因为现在保护它变成了他的任务
Because it's his job to now protect it.

1765
01:17:25,091 --> 01:17:27,042
这是我应该做的
This is what I'm supposed to do.

1766
01:17:28,016 --> 01:17:29,016
那是时候了
Then it's time.

1767
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:31,078
Jack自愿接受了这个任务
Jack takes this mission on willingly,

1768
01:17:31,092 --> 01:17:33,057
事实上  对Jack来说  
And in fact, for Jack,

1769
01:17:33,057 --> 01:17:34,098
这基本上是本剧贯穿始终的
it's a fulfillment of a quest

1770
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:36,089
对于一种追求的满足
That's basically spanned the entire series.

1771
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:40,052
我很高兴它这么结束了
I'm so happy with how it's all coming to an end,

1772
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:42,082
感觉上  感觉上这样做很正确
And it--it just feels so right.

1773
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:44,018
喝了它
Drink this.

1774
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:46,091
我们想让本剧最后一个镜头
We want the last frame of the last show

1775
01:17:47,004 --> 01:17:48,044
是关于这些人的
to be about these people

1776
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:50,062
六年前我们把这些人呈现在你们面前
Who we introduced you to six years ago

1777
01:17:50,075 --> 01:17:54,020
把你们带上了旅途和他们相伴
and carried you on journeys with and leave you with them

1778
01:17:54,031 --> 01:17:55,046
和他们的故事相伴
And leave you with their stories.

1779
01:17:56,011 --> 01:17:57,068
这个工作我要做多久
How long am I gonna have to do this job?

1780
01:17:57,092 --> 01:18:00,071
尽可能的久
As long as you can.

1781
01:18:00,087 --> 01:18:04,090
看到这个剧回到了开始的地方
To watch the show come back to the roots that it started from

1782
01:18:05,007 --> 01:18:08,078
并像开始时那样结束了  这就成功了
and end in the same way that it started is a victory.

1783
01:18:10,004 --> 01:18:11,031
你不想这本书结束
You don't want the book to come to an end,

1784
01:18:11,045 --> 01:18:13,036
但是当你合上书  你会说"天哪  真棒"
but you close the book and you go, "God, that was great."

1785
01:18:15,063 --> 01:18:17,048
现在你和我一样了
Now you're like me.

1786
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:19,088
我们希望结束了观众会说
We're hoping for a legacy where people say,

1787
01:18:20,004 --> 01:18:21,062
我花了六年时间
"I invested six years of my life

1788
01:18:21,074 --> 01:18:24,001
相当关心这个剧
"Really caring deeply about this show,

1789
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:26,041
我感觉这个结局
"And I feel that the way that it ended

1790
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:28,046
展现了  在故事叙述者而言
"Showed an- -an equal amount of respect

1791
01:18:28,052 --> 01:18:31,005
关注本剧平等的尊重
In caring for the show on the part of the storytellers."

1792
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,068
我们到了
We're here.

1793
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:35,095
我们觉得做了一部自己想做的剧
We felt like we made the show that we wanted to make,

1794
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:37,006
从头到尾都是自己的剧
from start to finish.

1795
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:39,031
我们更想
The larger messages

1796
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,040
传递给观众的信息是
that we wanted the audience to take away,

1797
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:44,006
我们感觉已经融入了这个剧  这个结尾
we feel are embedded in the show and in the finale.

1798
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:46,097
对于结局是否能成功而受到威胁的这个想法
The idea that here we are looking down the barrel

1799
01:18:47,009 --> 01:18:50,003
其实是一生仅此一次的经历
Of that ending is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1800
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:52,051
能成为其中的一部分
Words can't express the gratitude that I feel

1801
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:55,015
感激之情溢于言表
To--to have been able to be a part of that.

1802
01:18:55,015 --> 01:18:57,016
看来有人救他出去了
Looks like someone helped him out.

1803
01:18:57,095 --> 01:18:58,095
如果心中没有了
It wouldn't be "Lost"

1804
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:01,060
未解之谜  那这就不是"迷失"了
If we still didn't keep a few things close to the chest.

1805
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,056
不  Ben  是有人来帮我了
No, Ben, someone helped me out...

1806
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:07,005
因为我要找到Desmond
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

1807
01:19:08,052 --> 01:19:10,062
找到之后  他会帮我做
And when I do, he's gonna help me do

1808
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:13,060
我自己做不到的事
The one thing that I could never do myself.

1809
01:19:15,024 --> 01:19:17,008
我要毁了这个岛
I'm gonna destroy the island.

1810
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:22,098
要不是有强大粉丝做后盾  
We really don't believe that we ever would have made it this far

1811
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:25,005
我想我们根本没办法走这么远
If it weren't for the incredible, you know,

1812
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:27,030
真是有点腾云驾雾的感觉
Fan base of the show. It's pretty trippy

1813
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:29,068
真的是好极了  作为故事讲述者
And really wonderful. The greatest thing is--

1814
01:19:30,017 --> 01:19:32,001
我们远想不到最棒的事是
That we could have ever imagined as storytellers

1815
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,005
成为了这个团体的一分子
Was the ability to be a part of that community.

1816
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:37,008
这个剧感觉上已经不是我们做出来的了
This show doesn't feel like it's something that we made.

1817
01:19:37,031 --> 01:19:39,099
感觉上有点
It feels like something that kind of,

1818
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:42,042
像是早就存在  而我们只是顺手牵羊而已
Um, you know, existed and we were able to tap into.

1819
01:19:42,073 --> 01:19:45,051
我们真的很感谢有这个机会
We're profoundly grateful for having the chance to--

1820
01:19:45,061 --> 01:19:48,074
不仅仅创造了那个世界
to not only kind of build that world

1821
01:19:48,085 --> 01:19:50,027
并成为其中的一部分
but to be a part of it.
