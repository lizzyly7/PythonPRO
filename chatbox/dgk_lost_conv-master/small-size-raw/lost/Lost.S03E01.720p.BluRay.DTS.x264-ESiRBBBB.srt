这是我们的岛

他们攻击我们  分裂我们   绑架我们  谋杀我们
They've attacked us,sabotaged us,abducted us,murdered us.

我们都知道这个岛上还有其他人
We're not the only people on this island,and we all know it!

第一晚他们来  抓走了三个人

00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,063
他们聪明而且凶残
They're smart,and they're animals.

00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:28,089
你们跟我们走
You're coming with us.

10
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,086
When you're alone

11
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,005
and life is making you lonely

12
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,063
You can always go…

13
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,045
Downtown…

14
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:03,081
When you've go worries all the noise and the hurry

15
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:06,072
seems to help I know…

16
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,024
Downtown…

17
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:12,037
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city

18
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:16,055
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

19
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:19,029
How can you lose

20
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:22,038
The lights are much brighter there

21
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:24,065
You can forget all your troubles

22
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:26,037
Forget all your cares

23
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,095
so go downtown

24
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:31,069
Things will be great when you're downtown…

25
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,066
No finer place for sure… downtown…

26
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,064
我把松饼烤焦了....还有我的手...
I burnt my hand...and my muffins.

27

工作正在进行中
It's a work in progress.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,013
这根本不是文学作品  只是部闲书
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

30
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,091
为什么不是  Adam?
And why isn't it literature, Adam?

31
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,082
我很想知道
I'm dying to know.

32
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:53,077
里面没有比喻
There's no metaphor.

33
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,078
只有些数字和宗教传闻
It's by the numbers,religious hokum-pokum.

34
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,039
-没有比喻?     -这是科学小说
-No metaphor?  -It's science fiction.

35
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,096
现在我知道为什么Ben没有来
Now I know why Ben isn't here.

36
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,017
什么?
Excuse me?

37
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:05,006
我知道应该由主人选书  但是说实话  Juliet 他根本不会浪费时间看这本书
I know the host picks the book,but seriously,
Julie,he wouldn't read this in the damned bathroom.

38
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:13,007
Adam  我就是主人  我选了这本书 并且这本是我最喜欢的
Well,Adam,I am the host,and i do pick the book,and this,is my favorite book,

39
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:18,007
我真的相当"内疚"你不喜欢它
so I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it.

40
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:22,046
我很愚蠢  居然选择了Ben不会喜欢的东西
Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like.

41
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:28,033
所以我想 大家还是可以自由的选择...
Here I am,thinking that free will still actually exists on...

42

去门口
In the doorway,get in the door way.

看到飞机尾部落在哪里了吗?
You see where the tail landed?

45
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,056
看到了  应该在海里
Yeah,probably in the water.

46
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:34,037
跑过去  一小时就能到海滩

一个乘客  装得惊慌点

没问你就不要说
Stay quiet if they don't.

52
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,003
边听边学  别搞砸了
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

我在火车上遇到一个女人...Sarah

我捡到了她的手机 但我不知道她姓什么
she dropped her cell phone,and I don't even know her last name,

149

00:17:57,066 --> 00:18:00,073
对不起  对不起  算了
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.Forget it.

151

我不是让你等一下吗?
I asked you to give me a minute here.

153
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,020
这是什么?
What's this?

154
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,011
为什么你打这些Sarah手机上的电话?
Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?

155
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,069
因为他们当中有一个是和她在一起的男人
Because one of them is him.

156
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,031
你不能这样做 Jack
You gotta stop this,Jack.

157
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,025
已经结束了
It's over.

158
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:23,031
除非我知道他的名字  他在哪里工作  他住在哪里
Not until I know his name,where he works,where he lives.

159
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,034
他们在哪里第一次接吻
When they first kissed.

160
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:28,058
我想知道他是一个怎么样的人
I wanna know what it is about him.

161
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,028
爸爸  为什么Sarah会给你打电话?
Why is Sarah calling you,dad?

162
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:42,092
我觉得你应该就此罢手了
I think it's time that you let this go.

163
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,038
她为什么会给你打电话?
Why is she calling you?

164
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,009
-因为她担心你 - 爸爸...
-Because she was afraid...for you.  -Dad

165
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,041
我想清楚的知道她为什么会给你打电话
I wanna know exactly why the hell she would call you!

166
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,061
她看得出来你在逃避
She saw that you were slipping.

167
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,017
-你无法控制自己     -问题不是我能不能控制自己
-You were losing your grip.   -My grip is not the problem.

168
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,085
那正是现在发生这些事的原因
Which is exactly what's happening here.

169
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:57,071
算了吧 Jack
Jack! Come...

170
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,059
我认为你知道怎样让自己好点
I think I know a little something about being obsessive.

171
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:07,057
不  当一个酒鬼不是解决问题的办法
No,being a drunk is not obsessive.

172
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:22,028
放手吧 Jack
Let it go,Jack.

173
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,010
什么?
What?!

174
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:02,035
如果你是在和我说  那我听不见
If you're trying to talk to me,I can't hear you!

175
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,059
放手把 Jack
Let it go,Jack.

176
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,032
我知道你饿了
I know you're hungry.

177
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,050
我给你带了点吃的
I brought this for you.

178
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,074
现在我们这样
This is how it will work.

179
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:20,068
你坐在这里  背对着墙壁
You sit there,across from the door,back against the wall.

180
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:23,084
我把门打开留下盘子
I open the door and leave the tray.

181
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:27,082
我可以相信你吗?  Jack
Can I trust you to do that,Jack?

182
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:31,010
我不想要你的食物
I don't want your food.

183
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,034
这个三明治很可口...
It's a delicious sandwich...

184
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:38,011
我想你告诉对讲机那边的人  他可以放弃了
I want you to tell the guy who's talking to me through that intercom that he can give it up!

185
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,082
可能你现在真的很饿了
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.

186
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:43,088
那个对讲机已经坏了很多年了
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

187
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:45,063
那是什么?
What's that for?

188
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:48,014
那个按钮是用来干什么的?
The button-- what it's for?

189
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,031
是紧急时刻用的
It's for emergencies.

190
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,039
谁在监视我?
Who's watching me?

191
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,017
你能背靠着墙坐下吗? 这样我才能打开门
Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door?

192
00:20:56,017 --> 00:21:00,029
这个煎饼刚刚才烤好
It's...just off the frying pan.

193
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,074
你自己吃吧
You can have it.

194
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,064
你是干什么的 Jack?
What do you do,Jack?

195
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:12,059
你的职业是什么?
What's your profession?

196
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,001
我是讨债的
I'm a repo man.

197
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:20,096
当人们不能按时付款时 我代替银行收回他们赊款的东西
You know,when people don't pay their bills,I go in for the bank,and I collect their possessions.

198
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:23,074
我是一个有人性的人 所以我很喜欢这个工作
I'm a people person,so I really love it.

199
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,084
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

200
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,089
没有
No

201
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:30,036
从来都没有机会
I never saw the point.

202
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,052
你呢?
What about you?

203
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:36,067
除了做三明治你还有什么工作?
What's your job,besides making sandwiches?

204
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,081
这不是我做的
I didn't make it.

205
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:41,031
我只是把牙签插上去
I just put the toothpicks in.

206
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:51,010
当你们的飞机坠毁时 你们是从哪里起飞的?
When your plane crashed,where were you flying from?

207
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:00,014

Sydney.

208
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,074
你在那里干什么?
What were you doing there?

209
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:05,000
我去把我爸爸带回家
I was bringing my father home.

210
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,003
-你走这么远的路只为了...    -因为他死了
-Why would you go all the way to Australia just to...  -because he was dead.

211
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:14,071
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

212
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,061

You can trust me,Jack.

我不会伤害你
I'm not gonna hurt you.

216
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:46,054
这里到底发生了什么事?
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:19,069
从这里到你们的营地需要多长时间?
How long would it take to get to your camp?

218
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:23,078
你现在肯跟我说话了吗  小子?
What,you're talking to me now,Chachi?

219
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:27,097
从他们抓到你的地方出发  需要多久 一天吗?  两天?
From where they got you,how long a walk was it--Day? Two days?

220
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:30,093
你们飞机上的那些人怎么样?
Hey,what are the people like--from your plane?

221
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:33,042
他们太可怕了
Oh,they're just awesome.

222
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:37,028
我们的伊拉克人拷打了你们最后一个 来参观我们营地的人
Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our Iraqi.

223
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,082
他也拷打过我
He tortured me,too.

224
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:44,064
他自己再清楚不过了
Well,hell,he don't know any better.

我尝试逃跑却把你卷进来了

你刚来的时候我们给你的药有很强的副作用
The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a fairly serious side effect--dehydration.

241

你的头会很痛

舌头变得干燥  并且如果你不尽快进食   就会产生幻觉
Your throat is raw,and if you don't eat
 or drink something soon,you're going to start hallucinating.

243

你不需要回答问题

You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall.

我会打开门 放下盘子就走
Let me open that door,put the plate down and leave.

250
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:23,010
我知道如果你照做 就会好像你放弃了  输了
I know it feels like you're giving up,like you're 
losing if you do anything that I ask you to.

251
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,004

拔掉脑膜上的管子  进入观察阶段
Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a P. C. A.

256
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:29,049
你确定他能自我恢复么?
You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?

257
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:42,066
Shephard医生?
Dr. Shephard?

258
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,051

264
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,033
这里不方便说这个
This is not the place for this.

265
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,084
你一定是Jack了
You must be Jack.

266
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:46,046
想坐下加入我们吗?
Why don't you,grab a chair and join us?

267

272
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:03,068
你和他们说了我什么  爸爸 那个你的...你的儿子总是失败者?
What'd you tell'em about me,dad-- that your--your son never really had it?

273
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:06,010
和他爸不一样
Not like the old man.

274
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,054
他不想成功  包括他的... 他的生活  他的工作  他的婚姻?
I didn't have the will to make it work-- my--my life,my job,my marriage?

275
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:15,098
关于我的婚姻你和他们说了什么  爸爸?
What'd you tell'em about my marriage,dad?!

276

你们知道他怎么安排的吗?

277
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:21,079
每晚吃饭钱喝一瓶苏格兰酒

Dad!

281

我想...是什么帮助了你?
I wonder what--what helped you turn that corner?

282
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,042
也许是...一个新的女朋友?
You think maybe it was--a new lady friend?

283
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,042
-你认为是这样... -我不会听你讲话了
-You think maybe that's what it was..  -I will not let you talk to me..

Jack  求你了  放手吧
Jack,please,just let it go!

288
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:20,045
往哪儿出去?
Which way out?

00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,078
别这么做  Jack
Don't do this,Jack.

290
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:22,070
不要

291
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,073
不要

-打开门       -不  我不能  我不能  Jack

她说的是真的  Jack
She's telling the truth,Jack.

我对天发誓... 我会杀了她

反正你开了门她也会死的
Have her open the door,and she dies anyway.

300
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:06,010
我们都会死
We all do.

301
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:41,025
