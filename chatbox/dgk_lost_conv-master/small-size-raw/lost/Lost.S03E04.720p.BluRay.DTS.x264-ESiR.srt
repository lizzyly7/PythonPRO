但如果你开枪了

也许你今晚可以在海滩上过夜
Maybe you should move on the beach, just for the night.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,014
这样我就可以修一下顶棚了  做一些改进

还是你告诉我为什么我会在这?

38
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,043
我希望你喜欢蓝莓  不喜欢的话我...

- 我可以和Benjamin谈谈吗? - 什么?

00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,017
我可以和Benjamin谈谈吗? 因为我在想...
- Should i talk to Benjamin ? Because I'm sorry

41
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,059
你只是个给我送饭的
to think that you're just the person who brings me my food.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,095
你愿意的话你可以和他谈谈
You can talk to him all you want,

43

但他不会告诉你任何东西
but he won't tell you anything.

44
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:10,032
- 你在帮他干活 - 不  我没在为他工作
- You work for him. - No, I don't work for him.

他是头儿

我们不搞这一套  Jack
It doesn't work that way over here, Jack

47
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:16,007
- 我们一起做决定 - 真的吗?
We make decisions together. Really?

48
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,094
当我拿着那只破碗指着你脖子的时候
Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck,

49
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:22,096
他看起来对你的死活根本无所谓

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,044
我是说  这好像...
I mean, it felt like

51
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:27,007
他自己一个人做了一个决定
he made that decision on his own.

52
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,092
你不知道你自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

53
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,094
我没有服从他的决定
I don't answer to him.

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,008
Juliet  我需要你帮忙
Juliet, I need you.

感觉有点无聊么  唐人街来的小子
Soundin' a little stuffy there, Chinatown.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,067
想让鼻子开花吗?

- 给我个理由 - 我想我已经说过了

他们在...
- They're back in the...

70

都是你的错  Juliet
This is bad, Juliet.

00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,004
抬稳点
Keep her steady.

72
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,056
她会好的  是吗?  她会没事吗?
She'll be okay?

00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,042
发生了什么?
What happened?

74

我在这里这么久早知道
I've been on this rock long enough to realize

77
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:09,030
他们这伙人是不会自相残杀的
they ain't in the business of shootin' each other.

78
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,094
是我们干的
We did it.

79
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,030
我们的人

是那个鼻子破了的家伙的女朋友
That's broken nose man's girl.

94

然后抓住他们  滋的一声

他们触电倒地后  我就可以拿到钥匙了

把你眼里的星光擦去吧  亲爱的

112

因为我们必须这么做

关他什么事?
What about him?

115
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,087

甚至还不知道他是否活着

所有人返回牢房
All inmates are required

立即执行...
to report to your cells for mandatory...

122
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,041
问题是我只在意你的手 而不是你的眼神
Problem is, I was following your hands, no your eyes.

123
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,017
问题是你又老又不说话
Problem is, you old and dumb.

124
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,007
你藏在那里了?
Where did you hide it?!

Who's the punching bag?

126

刚来  叫Munson

127
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,032
听说他窃了政府一千万
Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil,

128
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,027
但政府却找不到这笔钱
but they never found the money.

129
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,042
- 真该死 - 说话啊  小子
I'll be damned.

130
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,048
如果你的监狱长朋友不制止的话
If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights,

131
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:16,035
Munson马上就会变死人了
Munson would be a dead man.

132
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,072
那个狗娘养的
That son of a bitch.

133
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:34,001
你晚上在枕头上放薄荷了吗?
You get little mints on your pillow at night, too?

134
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,044
什么?
- Sorry?

135
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:38,050
你才这里都一周了就开始做手提包了?
- You been here, what, a week, and you're on tote bag duty?

136
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,025
我来了九个月了  还在倒垃圾
I've been here nine months. I'm still pushing trash.

137
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,088
什么意思?
Well, what does that mean?

138
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,051
你以为监狱长制止你们打架...
You think the warden's breakin' up those fights

139
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,062
是因为你很帅吗  伙计?
'cause you're cute, Costanza?

140
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:52,030
他是为了那一千万在演戏
He's makin' a play for that 10 mil.

141
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:56,028
首先  给你点好处
First step, butter you up.

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,039
给你个好工作
Give you a plum job.

143
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:02,065
然后  监狱长就会向你妻子动手
Step two, the warden will reach out to your wife,

144
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,056
让她和你作对
use her against you.

145
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,047
巧妙的计划
Textbook con.

146
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,091
那么你友善的告诉我这些
And you're telling me

147
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,064
是因为你想...
this out of the kindness

148
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,093
这建议是免费的  伙计
- The advice is free, Murgatroyd.

149
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,047
过去的九个月   那个监狱长让我生活生不如死
Past nine months, that warden's made my life a living hell.

150
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,040
他拿了好处  而你却什么也没有
He gets that 10 mil you ain't got,

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,096
我真想杀了自己
I just might have to kill myself.

152
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,088
您好  狱长
Well, howdy, warden.

153
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:35,067
他妨碍你了吗  Munson?
He bothering you, Munson?

154
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,094
什么风把你吹到裁缝店来了  老板?
So what brings you　to the sewing shop, Boss?

155
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:47,006
别以为我无权给你加刑  Ford
Don't think　I an't extend your stay, Ford.

156
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:50,000
只要一个电话就够了
All it takes is one call.

157
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,096
一个电话
One call.

158
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,025
把那个垃圾捡起来好吗?
How about you get that trash?

159
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:26,066
魔王出现了
oh, yeah. It's the big Kahuna.

160
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,070
吃过午饭了吗?
- Lunch already?

161
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,082
- 你体重多少? - 什么?
- What do you weigh?　- What?

162
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,013
你体重多少?
- What do you weigh?

180左右
180, give or take.

164
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,053
你几岁了?
- 32.

165
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,024
 别骗我
- don't lie.

166
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,068
很好
Good.

167
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,003
再见吧你
Sayonara, sucke

168
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,010
你干了什么?
What did you do?

169
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,046
我们把它关了
We turned it off.

170
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:21,000
Sawyer

171
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,059
在天空变紫色后的两天里...
...two days since the sky turned purple,

172
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,092
我们瞎了  伙伴们都倒下了
we've been blind, our coms are all down

173
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,040
我没办法再支撑了
and I can't get 'em back up again,

174
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,055
为了避免你忘记Colleen的伤痕...
and in case you forgot,  - Colleen's in critical...

175
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:55,093
Juliet在照看她
- Juliet's taking care of her.

176
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,025
我在哪?
Where am I?

177
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,080
你们想干什么?
What the hell are you doin' to me?

178
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,050
放开我
Let me out!

179
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,062
Jason  放我出去
Jason. Let me out !

180
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,014
拜托咬紧它
Bite down on this, please.

181
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,000
你咬吧
You bite down on it.

182
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,075
会很痛的
It's for the pain.

183
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,096
什么?
What?!

184
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,095
等等
Wait!

185
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,084
放开我
Let me out now!

186
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:30,008
- 我讨厌针 - 不  不
I hate needles.

187
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,099
不  你们在干吗?
No! What are you doing?

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,098
你们干什么?
Hey! What are you doing?

189
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,056
不

190
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,079
你们到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?!

191
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,018
不对  你得穿透胸骨  是胸骨
No, you have to go through the sternum. Th sternum.

192
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,063
- 不 - 就像电影里的一样
- Like in the movies.

193
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,004
- 我知道 - 什么?
- I know, I know.

194
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,034
不  不

195
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,047
- 一... - 你干什么?
- One...- What are you doing?!

196
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,087
二...
Two...

197
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,065
等等
Wait!

198
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,060
顾自己玩吧  兄弟  我来拿根球杆
Don't mind me, brother. I'm just gonna take one of your clubs.

199
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,019
Hurley说没问题的
Hurley said it'd be all right.

200
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,003
Hurley  是吗?
Hurley, huh?

201
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,028
就是说你们又要去拯救大家了
Must mean you're off to save the day.

202
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:21,024
那么...我能拿一个吗?
So... I can take one of these?

203
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,002
拿5号杆吧
Take the 5-iron.

204
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,043
我从来不用
I never use it.

205
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:25,096
这样  当你们做你们的事
That way, when you die in the jungle

206
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,096
死在丛林里后
doing whatever you're doing,

207
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,030
我就不用去找它了
I don't have to go looking for it.

208
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,083
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, mate.

209
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,004
你知道  你应该...
You know, you might want

210
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,021
肩膀甩的范围更大些
to square your shoulders a bit more.

211
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,010
你会打高尔夫?
- You play golf?

212
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,072
我是苏格兰人  玩得开心
- I'm scottish.

213
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,042
这是什么?
What the hell?

214
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,018
快点
Hey, come on.

215
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,089
摇动吧  快点  快点  快点 
Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on!

216
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,075
- 你在干什么? - 快点  快点  快  快
- What are you doing? - Come on. Come on,

217
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,066
开始吧  开始吧 开始吧  跳舞吧
Let's move it, let's move it.

218
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,022
- 开始吧  快 - 你在干嘛?

219
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,024
- 动起来  动起来  动起来 - 你有毛病?
What's your problem?

220
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:39,034
快  快  快  快

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,007
你弄死了它?
Did you just kill that bunny?

222
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,085
你知道起搏器吗?
You know what a pacemaker is?

223
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:01,050
- 什么? - 他们把起搏器放在...
What? They stick 'em in the tickers

224
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,047
做过搭桥手术的人的心脏里
of people who've had bypass work,

225
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:07,077
他们的心脏需要驱动力
a little jump, a kick start.

226
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,043
那只兔子就装了个小起搏器
The rabbit had a small pacemaker

227
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,080
它会在这些时候产生驱动力 像是太兴奋...
set to deliver its kick start, should it get too excited...

228
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,079
或是太焦虑...或是害怕...
or anxious or frightened...

229
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:20,004
或是企图逃走
or should it try to escape.

230
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,048
假如你对于你的年龄和体重
Assuming that you were telling the truth

231
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,092
没有说谎的话
about your age and weight,

232
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,082
你静止时的心率
your resting heart rate

233
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:33,006
应该在每分钟70下
should be about 70 beats per minute.

234
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,043
然而你活动时的心率
Your active heart rate, however,

235
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:39,008
可能会在140
that would be about 140.

236
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,026
超过这个数字  你的起搏器...
Which is the point at which your pacemaker...

237
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:48,024
就会弄爆你的心脏
will cause your heart to explode.

238
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:57,021
这样我就可以确信你会乖乖的了
Which is how I know that you're gonna start behaving now.

239
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,099
这只表可以监控你的脉搏
The watch monitors your pulse.

240
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:10,020
如果心跳接近危险区域15下以内的话
If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone,

241
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,096
它会响  一旦它响了
it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps,

242
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:16,003
你就得让自己冷静
you're gonna want to relax yourself.

243
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:21,052
做做深呼吸  瑜伽什么的
Do some deep breathing, some yoga.

244
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,006
如果你想我死
If you want me dead,

245
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,087
为什么不一枪了结了我?
why don't you just shoot me and get it over with?

246
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:32,006
因为我们不是杀手  James
Because we're not killers, James.

247
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:38,045
还有件事  Kate
Oh, and one other thing. - Kate.

248
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,061
你碰她的话  我发誓... - 如果你告诉她我们做了什么...
You touch her, I swear...

249
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,053
我们把什么植入你体内   我们在监控你们
what we put in you, that we're watching you,

250
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,090
你告诉她这些的话
you tell her any of these things,

251
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,043
我们也会给她装上一个的
we'll put one in her, too.

252
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:03,097
Sawyer?

253
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,016
Sawyer  你没事吧?
Sawyer, are you okay?

254
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:19,005
给你们擦身子用的
That's so you can clean yourselves up.

255
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,058
Kate  如果有不合身的话
And, Kate, if any of that doesn't fit,

256
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,084
叫我一声就好了  好吗?
you just give me a holler, okay?

257
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,024
发生了什么?
What happened?

258
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:37,049
他们做了什么?
What did they do to you?

259
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:41,040
没什么  就问了些问题
Nothing. They just asked me questions.

260
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,037
没什么大不了的
Ain't important.

261
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,034
告诉我  发生了什么?
Talk to me. What happened?

262
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,084
听着  我告诉过你  没事
Look, I told you, nothing happened.

263
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,099
别再问了
So quit asking me.

264
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,004
转过去
Turn around.

265
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,063
那是什么?
What's that?

266
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,060
我的手表  坏了的
Just my watch. It's busted.

267
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,016
- 你哪来的表? - 我不用每件事都向你汇报吧
- When did you get a watch? - Look, I don't tell you everything!

268
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,002
让我安静会儿  该死的
Just leave me alone, damn it.

269
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:55,086
穿上衣服
Put some clothes on.

270
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,072
你好  Sawyer.
Hello, Sawyer.

271
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,063
我叫James Ford  我想你知道的
It's James Ford, and I know you know that,

272
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:43,013
你告我的时候就用的这个名字
cause you got it right when you pressed charges.

273
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:45,021
你生我的气?
You're mad at me?

274
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,016
看看我的处境
Well, look where I am.

275
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,065
你想我怎么样?  你骗了我
What did you want me to do? You conned me.

276
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,045
你想要什么?
Something you want?

277
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:56,005
是的是的  是有东西
Yeah. Yeah. There is.

278
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,054
快点  我有执照的
Come on. I got license plates to make.

279
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,030
她是谁?
What's this?

280
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,051
是你女儿
This is your daughter.

281
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,004
你想怎么样?
What do you want?

282
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,031
首先我想让你知道这个
Well, first I wanted you to know.

283
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,096
然后呢?  你想我一看这张照片
Then what? Think I'm gonna take　one look at this picture

284
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,016
就去参加"老爸最好"这个节目吗?
and turn into "father knows best"?

285
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,051
我们住在新墨西哥州的这个小地方
We're living in this little place　in Albuquerque.

286
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,067
- 在一所大学附近... - 你和我说这些干嘛?
It's near the university.　- Why are you telling me this?

287
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:43,038
我只是...想让你给她写封信
-  just...　thought you could write her a letter.

288
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,003
她叫Clementine
Her name's Clementine.

289
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,018
我该死的可以写点什么?
What the hell am I gonna write?

290
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:48,045
"亲爱的变形金刚"? 她还是个孩子
"Dear goo-goo ga-ga"?

291
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,054
她不是我的
She's a baby. She ain't mine.

292
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,033
Sawyer  她...
Sawyer, she...

293
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,016
我没有女儿
I ain't got no daughter.

294
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,042
我查看过我的笼子了
I've been checking out my cage,

295
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,075
我想如果我爬上去的话
and I think if I climb to the top,

296
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,039
我可以从缝隙里挤出去
I can squeeze through those bars.

297
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,067
他们离这里很远
They're spaced farther apart up there.

298
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,019
别找事了
Don't bother.

299
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,084
你在说什么?
- What are you talking about?

300
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,095
我说放聪明点
- I'm talking about being smart.

301
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,001
我想我们还是乖乖呆着
I think we should just chill out here a while,

302
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,005
听天由命吧
get the lay of the land.

303
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,088
...在控制下了
...under control.

304
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,078
是吗?  你知道他怎么对Karl吗?
Yeah?　You know what he's doing to Karl?

305
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:44,013
你知道他怎么做吗?
You know what he's doing?

306
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:46,067
把他们两个带来是个错误

307
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:51,094
- 你们对Sawyer怎么了? - 没什么

如果你不帮我   监狱长就会得到所有的钱
If you don't help me, the Warden'll get it all.

我怎么知道
Hell if I know.

401

这些人什么时候告诉过我们为什么?
These people ever make any sense to you?

00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:27,042
你干什么?
What are you doing?

我不知道他们对你做了什么
I don't know what they did to you,

410
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:56,052
但是我知道你害怕得不敢讲实话了
but I know you're scared enough to lie about it,

411
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,093
那比任何他们的所作所为
and that scares me more than anything

412
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:01,075
- 都让我感到害怕 - 等等

你也可以在另外一只上也画个"8"

现在你站的小岛上
Right now you're standing on a small island roughly

535
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,055
面积差不多是Alcatraz的两倍

536
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:37,009
而那边那个

there's nowhere to run.

00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:54,099
你做这些只是...
You did all this just to...

542
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:59,029
只是为了把我关在一个破笼子里?
Just to keep me in a damn cage?

543
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:00,074
我们这么做是因为唯一可以赢得
We did all this because the only way

544
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:03,072
骗子的尊重的方法就是去欺骗他们
to gain a con man's respect is to con him.

545
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,019
你很不错  "Sawyer"
You're pretty good, "Sawyer."

546
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,020
但我们更出色
We're a lot better.

547
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:19,087
有意思的是  让你规规矩矩的
Funny thing is, us telling you

548
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,090
不是因为起搏器
about the pacemaker

549
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,090
而是因为我威胁会伤害她
wasn't what kept you in line. It was when i threatened her.

550
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:27,055
你是这么努力得让她觉得 你不在乎她
You work so hard to make her think you don't care,

551
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:30,046
和你不需要她  但是...
that you don't need her, but...

552
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:35,055
"一个人爱上了另一个人就会疯狂
"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."

553
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:39,092
"不管这人是谁

554
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,046
只要是和你在一起的"
as long as he's with you."

555
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:45,057
"我告诉你...
"I tell you...

556
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:47,046
"我告诉你如果一个人太孤单的话
"I tell you a guy gets too lonely

557
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,087
就会感到不适"
and he gets sick."

558
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,037
你到底在说什么?
- What the hell are you talking about?

559
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,022
是"人鼠之间"里的
- It's from "of mice and men."

560
