-等等...  -你觉得自己是谁?!

你在这两天里不停的给我打电话
You call me over and over again for two days straight,

00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,098
然后你拿着Jeremy Bentham的讣告来这
And then you show up here with an obituary for Jeremy Bentham.

38
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,040
当他来找我  我得知我们必须说

因为他说  那是唯一的办法

能保证你的安全  你和Arron的安全

45
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,089
别提他的名字

00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,080
当时你为什么不在那给他读书

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,068
所以别提他的名字!
So don't you say his name!

49
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,012

52
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,032
所发生的可怕的事
That happened on the day that we left.

53
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,051
你还有什么资格要我回去?
How dare you ask me to go back?

54
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:14,091
你确定我们的方位是对的吗?
You sure we're going the right way?

55
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,062
Lapidus说他们朝东北走
Lapidus said they were headed northeast.

56
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,035
你最好走慢点
You might wanna slow down a little,

57
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:22,038
-因为你看起来象要跌倒  医生  -我很好
-Cause you look like you're about to keel over Doc. -I'm fine.

是那儿吗?

60
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,018
我不知道
I don't know.

61
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,001
现在怎么办  大摇大摆的过去?
So what's the plan, sundance?

62
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,000
我们等到...
The plan is we wait till--

63
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,021

64
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:46,019
Sawyer!
Sawyer!

65
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,020
你还好吧?
You all right?

66
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,047
伙计  你回来了  你怎么知道我在这儿?
Dude, you came back. how'd you know where I was?

67
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,049

00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,056

72
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,093

能把一艘航母炸掉
To blow up a bloody aircraft carrier.

75
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,014

77
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:11,031
就像俗话说的
Which, as the saying goes,

78
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,087
这段时间正好让你学会怎么把自己炸飞
Is just enough time to learn how to blow yourself up.

79
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,063
有计时器吗?  怎么还没爆炸?
Is it on a timer? And why hasn't it gone off yet?

80
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:21,013
这是个收音机  这是...
This is a-a radio receiver. It's...

81
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,062
就像个步话机
It's like a walkie-talkie.

82
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,021
你给他发送个信号  然后...
You send it a signal, and, uh...

83
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,005
就会远程引爆炸弹
It--it triggers the bomb remotely.

84

85

这是拉发线  移动一下就会...爆炸

89
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,097
爆炸
Boom.

90
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,076
这是多重线圈引爆系统
This is multiple firing systems.

91
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:52,083
损毁一个  另一个就会...爆炸
You disable one, the next one... boom.

92
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:57,031
这个...电池是能量来源
Um, this... battery's the power source.

93
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,066
如果你卸下它...爆炸
If you disconnect it... boom.

94
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,049
你在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing in here?

95
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:30,060
这下面有一个达摩站
There's a-a dharma station below us,

96
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:33,009
我在找条进去的路
And, um, I'm looking for a way to get in.

97
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,002
进去干嘛?
Get in and do what?

98
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:39,072
Hugo  James  不介意我和Jack单独谈谈吧?
Hugo, James, would you mind if I spoke to Jack alone?

99
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,022
不用了  我们回来只是找Hurley的
Don't bother. We just came back for Hurley.

100
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,036
走吧
Let's go.

101
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:47,080
-Jack  你得听我跟你说  -不  我要做的是...
-Jack, you need to hear what I have to say-- -no, what I need to do

102
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:51,023
回到直升机那  上飞机

103
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:53,072
然后把其他人带离这个岛
And get the rest of our people off this island.

104
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,045
伙计  这可不是现在最好的选择
Uh, dude, probably not the best idea right now.

105
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,045
那些军人正把Ben押往那个直升机
Those rambo guys are taking Ben to that helicopter.

106
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,048
一小时前Ben向他们投降了
He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago.

107
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,021
他为什么那样做?
Now why the hell would he do that?

108
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,065
告诉我  Ben
So tell me something, ben.

109
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:23,017

114

Now we've traveled all the way across country

154
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:23,041
就是为了他能来见你
Just so he could see you.

155
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:27,083
我得知道你会不会干些疯事
I need to know if you're gonna do anything crazy.

156
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:30,061
我不会做什么疯狂的事
I won't do anything crazy.

157
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,040
Walt
Hey, walt.

158
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,052
Hurley
Hey, hurley.

159
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,002
你长大了  伙计  
You're getting big, dude.

160
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,082
你知道  当你们回来的时候
You know, when you came back,

161
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,018
我一直在盼望你们中有人能来看我
I was waiting for one of you to come see me,

162
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,075
不过...  没有人来
But... nobody did.

163
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,026
抱歉
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,040
你知道后来谁来看我了吗?
Do you know who did come see me?

165
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,049
Jeremy Bentham
Jeremy bentham.

166
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:39,010
我不明白你们为什么要撒谎
I don't understand why you're all lying.

167
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,026
我们撒谎...
We're lying...

168
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:56,010
是因为只有这样才能保护
Because it's the only way to protect everyone

169
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,039
其他没有回来的人
That didn't come back.

170
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:01,009
就像我爸爸?
Like my dad?

171
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:06,016
就像你爸爸  是的
Like your dad, yeah.

172
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:33,087
他们到底在那说什么?
What the hell they talkin' about in there, anyway?

173
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,077
我不知道  领导权问题?
I don't know. leader stuff?

174
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,086
你从哪弄的?
Where'd you get that?

175
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,067
Ben从地下挖出的盒子里的  还不错
Came from a box ben dug up out of the ground. they're good.

176
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:53,016
谢谢你回来找我
Thanks for coming back for me.

177
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,089
你值得的
Ah, you got it.

178
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:59,060
Claire和她的婴儿都还好吧?
Claire and the baby okay?

179
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,060
你想跟我说什么  John?
What did you wanna talk to me about, john?

180
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:15,049
我想你能重新考虑下离开这个岛  Jack
I want you to reconsider leaving the island, jack.

181
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,073
我想你留下来
I would like you to stay.

182
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,097
你想我留下来
You'd like me to stay.

183
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,093
是的  就是这样
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:24,023
你飞了一把匕首
You threw a knife

185
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:25,078
插在了一个没有武装的女人背后
Into the back of an unarmed woman.

186
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,012
你带着我们一半的人横穿过这个岛
You led half of our people across the island

187
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,058
而让他们大多数都被杀了
And got most of them killed.

188
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:30,097
Jack  你用枪指着我脑袋
Well, jack, you put a gun to my head

189
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:32,014
然后你扣下了扳机
And you pulled the trigger.

190
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,076
我希望我们能让过去的都过去了
I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones.

191
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,000
我跟你说
Well, I'll tell you what.

192
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,083
你就待在这个小温室里好了
You stay here in your little greenhouse,

193
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:46,013
不过我们其余人的要回家了
But the rest of us are going home.

194
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,075
不过你不应该回家
But you're not supposed to go home.

195
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,053
那我到底应该做什么?
And what am I supposed to do?

196
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,024
我想我还记得
Oh, I think I remember.

197
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,065
在回到舱门的路上你说的是什么
What was it that you said on the way out to the hatch--

198
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,046
那个坠机是我们的宿命?
That crashing here was our destiny?

199
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:02,019
你知道的  Jack  你知道你在这儿是有原因的
You know, jack. you know that you're here for a reason.

200
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:03,077
你知道的
You know it.

201
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:07,057
而如果你离开这里
And if you leave this place,

202
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,088
那种原因就会从你的内心开始
That knowledge is gonna eat you alive

203
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,035
慢慢吞噬你...
From the inside out...

204
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:17,000
直到你决定回来
Until you decide to come back.

205
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,046
再见  John
Good-bye, john.

206
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,018
你要对他们撒谎
You're gonna have to lie.

207
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,094
什么?
Excuse me?

208
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,049
如果你不得不走
If you have to go,

209
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,028
那么你不得不对所有的事情撒谎...
Then you have to lie about everything...

210
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:38,005
自从我们来到这个岛上发生的所有事情
Everything that happened since we got to the island.

211
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:43,081
这是唯一能保护它的办法
It's the only way to protect it.

212
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,065
这只是个岛  John
It's an island, john.

213
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,063
没有人需要保护它
No one needs to protect it.

214
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,061
这不是个岛
It's not an island.

215
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,091
这是个奇迹发生的地方
It's a place where miracles happen.

216
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,090
如果...如果你不相信
And--and--if you-- if you don't believe that,

217
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,028
Jack  如果你不能相信的话
Jack, if you can't believe that,

218
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:05,089
那你在这里等着  看我要做的事吧
Just wait till you see what I'm about to do.

219
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,035
世上根本就没有奇迹
There's no such thing as miracles.

220
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:19,060
我们就看看到底谁是对的
We'll just have to see which one of us is right.

221
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,059
我打扰了吗?
Am I interrupting?

222
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,032
很高兴看见你  Jack
Nice to see you, too, jack.

223
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:35,032
找不到安祖花  是吗?
Couldn't find the anthuriums, could you?

224
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,078
我不知道它们长什么样
I don't know what they look like.

225
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,097
你们在干什么?
What are you doing?

226
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,096
你没有告诉他吗?
Didn't you tell him?

227
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,032
我试了
I tried.

228
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,016
Sayid和Kate正在直升机那等你
Sayid and kate are waiting for you at the helicopter.

229
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,056
我知道你们从海滩来的人
I understand that your people from the beach

230
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,022
-就在我们说话的时候正在被送往货船  -什么?
Are being brought to the freighter even as we speak. what?

231
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:05,041
我很愿意告诉所有的细节  Jack
I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, jack,

232
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,065
不过你  Hugo  James  你们需要离开了
But you, hugo, james, you need to get moving.

233
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:11,028
如果我是你  我会很想在一小时内到船上的
If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour.

234
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,098
再见  Jack  走吧
Good-bye, jack. let's go.

235
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,071
跟他们说谎  Jack
Lie to them, jack.

236
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,099
如果你对自己都撒谎的话
If you do it half as well as you lie to yourself,

237
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,058
他们会相信你的
They'll believe you.

238
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:55,005
Michael  下面出什么事了?
Michael? what's going on down there?

239
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:58,010
准备走了?
Ready to go?

240
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,039
你有告诉其他人吗?
Did you tell anybody?

241
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:01,057
没有  没说
No, michael. i-i didn't.

242
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,067
能...能关掉吗?
Can you... t-turn it off?

243
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,031
还没开呢
It isn't even on yet.

244
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:08,086
但...当然  如果水槽里的 
But, yeah, if what's in this tank

245
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,022
东西起作用的话
Does what it's supposed to do,

246
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,041
我们就没事了
We're gonna be okay.

247
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,017
听着  我会让Jin到上面来
Look, I'll send jin upstairs.

248
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,038
他应该在上面陪你
There's no need for him to be down there with me

249
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,071
没必要在下面把时间浪费在我身上
When he can be up here with you.

250
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:23,025
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

251
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,096
恭喜你  Sun
Congratulations, sun.

252
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,001
-你要干什么?  -把它冻起来
You're gonna what? freeze it.

253
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:48,061
这是液化氮
This is liquid nitrogen.

254
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,053
我们可以用它来冷藏
We use it in the refrigeration hold.

255
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:55,010
炸弹需要充电才能引爆  对吧?
The bomb needs a charge from the battery to detonate, right?

256
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,064
而电池则需要化学反应才能有电
And the battery runs on a-a chemical reaction.

257
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,069
把液化氮喷在电池上  让它处于低温状态
I spray the battery. I can keep it cold.

258
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,042
就不会发生化学反应
No reaction.

259
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,018
那现在的问题是?
And what's the catch?

260
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:09,043
问题是我们只有一罐
The catch is we only have one canister.

261
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,011
用完了  我们就等于回到了最开始
We use it up, we're right back where we started.

262
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,090
那我们是不是应该等到灯变红再用?
Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red?

263
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,079
如果等灯变红了
If we see that light turn red

264
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,064
而电池又还到需要的温度以下
And the battery's not already cold,

265
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,084
那红灯就是我们在世界上看到的最后的东西了
That is the last thing we will ever see.

266
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:25,086
无论怎样  至少我们这样有个预兆
Either way, at least we'll have a warning,

267
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,048
为我们赢得一点时间
Buy ourselves some time.

268
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,086
好吧  把电池先冻起来
All right, um, freeze the battery.

269
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,084
Jin  帮我找这些线的源头
Jin, help me trace back these wires,

270
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,019
列出每一根线的走向
Make a list of where each of them goes to.

271
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,092
船!
Boat!

272
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,025
谢谢
Thank you.

273
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:03,012
-下来  -你把他们都送上船了吗?
Down there. did you get them all to the boat?

274
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,027
-是的  都平安到达了  -他们往这儿来了吗?
Yeah, everybody's safe. are they coming closer?

275
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,004
他们修好引擎  就会尽量往这里开
They fixed the engine, and they're gonna get as close

276
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,070
开到撞不到暗礁的地方
To the island as they can without hitting the reef,

277
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,015
所以下一批不会花太久时间
So the next trip shouldn't take so long.

278
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,021
我去喝点水
I'm just gonna get some water,

279
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:13,065
-马上回来  -我让第二组准备出发
And I'll come back in a minute. okay, I'll get the next group ready to go.

280
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,025
-谢了  -Dan!
Thank you. dan!

281
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:18,030
-怎么?  -谢谢你帮我们
Yeah? thanks for helping us.

282
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,024
这算什么
Absolutely.

283
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:26,032
好了  出发
Okay, let's go!

284
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,058
谁允许你吃花生的?
Uh, who told you you could eat those peanuts?

285
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:39,031
那我...我能吃这些花生吗?
May--may I eat these peanuts?

286
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:42,020
我会盯着你的  小矮子
I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty.

287
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:49,007
-Miles...  -你脖子怎么了?
Miles... somethin' wrong with your neck?

288
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,077
-跟着我  -Dan  你回来了
Follow me, please. dan, you're back.

289
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,004
怎么了
Hey. what's wrong?

290
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:56,063
我离开十分钟  送下一组人到轮船上去
I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the next group of people

291
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:58,090
你们必须保证和我一起在船上
To the freighter. you need to make sure that you're with me

292
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,003
不用担心我  我留下来
On that raft, all right? well, don't worry about me, cause I'm gonna stay.

293
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,070
Miles  不不
Miles, no, uh, uh,

294
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:07,019
我想我还没把...
I don't think I'm getting across the... direness

295
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,026
事态的紧急跟你说明白
Of the circumstance.

296
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:11,025
不  你说得够明白了  但我还是得留下
Oh, no, you're very dire, but I'm still gonna stay.

297
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,016
十分钟后
Hey, ten minutes.

298
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,001
好的
Yep.

299
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,002
我很惊讶你竟然会走
I'm surprised you wanna leave.

300
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,091
太奇怪了
It's just weird.

301
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:25,021
在你花了那么多时间
You know, after all that time you spent

302
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,049
好不容易回到这儿后
Trying to get back here.

303
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:30,037
你说的"回到这儿"  是什么意思?
What do you mean, get back here?

304
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,039
我什么意思?
What do I mean?

305
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,065
这儿到底有多深?
How deep is the station?

306
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,044
很深
Deep.

307
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:38,048
这就是魔法盒?
Is this the magic box?

308
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,026
不  John  那不是
No, john, it's not.

309
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,018
这些都是干什么的?
What is all this stuff for?

310
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,079
和其他达摩站里的东西差不多...
Same things that all the dharma stations are for...

311
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:57,022
都是为了那些愚蠢的实验
Silly experiments.

312
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,014
什么样的实验?
What kind of experiments?

313
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,091
你知道吗  John?
You know what, john?

314
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:06,064
你为什么不看看这卷"扫盲带"
Why don't you watch this very informative video

315
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,047
可能可以回答一些你的问题
That will answer some of your questions?

316
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:13,029
我要做点别的事
And I'll take care of some business.

317
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,022
你好  我是edgar halliwax博士
Hello. I'm dr. edgar halliwax...

318
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,012
这卷是达摩组织
And this is the orientation film

319
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:42,027
第六观察站的宣传录像
For station six of the dharma initiative.

320
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,029
你们都知道
As you've no doubt surmised,

321
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,087
第六站  或称之为"兰花站"
Station six, or "the orchid,"

322
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:49,057
可不是什么植物研究单位
Is not... a botanical research unit.

323
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,014
这个岛上独特的现象
The unique properties...of this island

324
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:55,083
创造了类似一种喀希米尔的效应
Have created a kind of casimir effect,

325
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,040
也为达摩组织做这些独特的实验提供了条件
Allowing the dharma initiative to conduct unique experiments

326
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:02,060
而这些实验涉及到空间与时间
In both space and time.

327
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:09,039
这就是..."传送室"
This... is "the vault,"

328
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:13,038
建立来通往邻近
Constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe... to be

329
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,017
充满带有负电荷的"外来事物"的空间
Negatively charged "exotic matter."

330
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:21,019
必须要非常小心来避免
Great care must be taken to avoid leaving

331
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:22,091
房间里有
Inorganic materials...

332
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:25,018
无机物的残余...
Inside the chamber.

333
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:28,066
这个岛的电磁能量
The electromagnetic energy within the island

334
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,064
及其的不稳定而且无法预测
Can be highly volatile and unpredictable.

335
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,040
为了您自身
Now for your own safety

336
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,012
和您周围人的安全
And the safety of those around you,

337
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:39,004
请勿携带金属物品
Metallic objects must never...

338
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,089
进入传送室
Be placed within the vault.

339
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:47,055
我们初步证实
In our first demonstration,

340
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,096
我们试图将测试主体所在的
We will attempt to shift the test subject

341
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,074
四维空间提前100毫秒
100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space.

342
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,097
此时
Of moments,

343
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,067
动物看似会消失
The animal will seem to disappear,

344
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,000
但事实上...
But in reality...

345
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:25,011
他的意思是我认为的那样吗?
Uh... was he talking about what I think he was talking about?

346
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,072
如果你是指做时间旅行的兔子  那么的确如此
If you mean time-traveling bunnies, then yes.

347
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,036
你确实知道他强调道
You do know that he said specifically

348
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,023
不能在这里面放任何金属物体?
Not to put anything metal in here.

349
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,082
你在等人?
You expecting someone?

350
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,065
我可以拿回我的武器吗?
May I have my weapon back?

351
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,082
Sayid!
Sayid!

352
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:22,001
Kate!
Kate!

353
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,078
见到你真高兴  伙计
Good to see you, dude.

354
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:42,054
他说什么让你发火了吗?  雀斑女?
He say somethin' to tick you off, freckles?

355
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:45,082
-他不是我杀的  -那你杀的是哪个?
Didn't kill that one. well, which one did you kill?

356
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,052
孩子在哪儿?
Where's the baby?

357
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:53,085
和Sun在一起  现在应该在轮船上了
He's with sun, and they should be at the freighter by now.

358
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,007
你还好吧
Are you okay?

359
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,078
现在还好
I am now.

360
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:04,009
肯尼·洛杰斯
Hey, kenny rogers.

361
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,052
你在干什么?  撬锁?
What you trying to do there, pick a lock?

362
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:08,097
你有什么更好的主意?
You got a better idea?

363
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,024
钢锯
Hacksaw.

364
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:14,055
是锯我的手铐吧?
For the handcuffs, right?

365
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,059
来吧
Okay.

366
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,039
放松  没事了  没事了
Take it easy. all right, all right.

367
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,037
Sayid  你怎么回来的?
Sayid, how'd you get back?

368
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:28,078
我从货轮上搞了只橡皮艇
I took the zodiac from the freighter.

369
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:30,004
现在安全了吗?
Is it safe?

370
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,080
一具尸体冲上了海岸
A body from the boat washed up on the beach.

371
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,095
现在安全了
It's safe now.

372
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,043
很好
All right!

373
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,040
快离开这鬼地方吧
Let's get the hell outta here!

374
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,047
走了  雀斑女
Let's go, freckles.

375
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:51,097
我已经受够了这鬼地方了
I've seen enough of this rock.

376
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,055
我们到达之后  还可以回来
After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back

377
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,089
-找Claire  对吧?  -当然
And look for claire, right? absolutely.

378
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,043
把手脚都伸回来
Hands and feet inside the vehicle!

379
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:18,044
起飞了
Let's go for a ride!

380
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,012
我想我有办法了
I think I might have something.

381
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:08,054
好的  那么  那么如果..
Okay, so... so if...

382
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:10,098
如果我把这些线切断
If I cut this wire, it...

383
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:13,020
它就不会与起爆装置相连接
It should disconnect the firing mechanisms.

384
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:16,053
住手
Stop!

385
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:21,022
没有好处
No good.

386
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,052
该死的
Damn it!

387
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,095
我知道的还不够
I-i just don't know enough.

388
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:29,062
我们  我们怎么知道
H-how do we even know

389
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,019
你的小把戏有作用?
Your little freezing trick's doing anything?

390
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,082
只有当灯变红了而我们还活着的时候才知道
We'll know if that light turns red and we're still here.

391
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:37,040
我们还剩多少?
How much stuff do we have left?

392
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,003
四分之一罐
We got a quarter tank.

393
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:47,014
如果我们拆不了这炸弹会怎么样?
What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb?

394
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,072
我们最好把所有人从这条船上转移
We better get everybody the hell off this boat.

395
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,039
-怎么了?  -我们在漏油
What's the matter? we're losing fuel.

396
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,080
你说什么?
What?!

397
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,084
我们在漏油
We're losing fuel!

398
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,081
看看外面  告诉我能看见什么
Look outside! tell me if you see anything!

399
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:36,068
油罐漏了
We have a fuel leak!

400
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,066
子弹一定打穿了油罐
A bullet must have pierced the tank!

401
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:42,045
-我们要找个地方降落  -不  不能降落
We gotta find a place to set her down! no, don't land!

402
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:44,097
-为什么?  这岛上没有燃料
What?! there's no fuel on the island!

403
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,099
我们要到船上去  否则这直升机一点用也没有
We've gotta get to the boat, or this chopper's useless!

404
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:51,051
-我告诉你了  我还没找到船  -那就继续找
I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat! well, then keep looking!

405
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:03,016
我们得把所有多余的东西
We gotta get every ounce of extra weight

406
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,042
扔下去
Off this chopper now!

407
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,021
所有没用的东西  都扔下去
Anything that's not bolted down, toss it out!

408
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:28,036
现在怎么样?  够了吗?  我们能到吗?
Now what? is that enough? can we make it?!

409
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:32,022
我觉得如果
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

410
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,095
能再轻100磅就好多了
If we were a few hundred pounds lighter!

411
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:42,032
我们离这岛还是很近  能在海滩附近降落
We're still close enough to ditch it on the beach. hey!

412
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,059
别再回那个岛了
Do not go back to the island!

413
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,030
医生  我们可能没有选择了
We might not have a choice, doc.

414
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,013
为什么告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me this?

415
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:23,060
照我说的做就行了  雀斑女
Just do it, freckles.

416
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,030
Sawyer
Sawyer!

417
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:07,035
你好   charlotte
Hey, charlotte!

418
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,090
听我说  我想在你上船之前
Listen, uh, I wanted to say

419
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,065
和你说  请...
Before you get on the boat, please--

420
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,089
我想留下  Daniel
I'm gonna stay, daniel...

421
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,053
至少现在想
For now, anyway.

422
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,077
没有  "现在"
There is no "for now."

423
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:29,015
如果你不跟我一起  "现在就是永远"
If you don't come with me, "for now" could be forever.

424
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,019
没有什么是永远
Nothing's forever.

425
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:42,016
如果我告诉你   我还在寻找我出生的地方
Would it make any sense if I told you

426
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:44,021
你会理解吗?
I was still looking for where I was born?

427
00:36:46,024 --> 00:36:47,009
不会
N-no.

428
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:57,004
再见  daniel
Good-bye, daniel.

429
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:15,083
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

430
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:17,071
你也不来
You're not coming.

431
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,084
我答应过  不把最后一个人安全送走
I promised I wouldn't leave

432
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:22,028
不会离开这个岛
Until I got everyone here safely off this island.

433
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,089
别紧张
Relax.

434
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,071
当你回来的时候  我还会在这儿
I'll still be here when you get back.

435
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:29,029
好吧  好吧
Right, right...

436
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:31,013
当我回来
When I get back.

437
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,056
好了  大家准备好了吗?
Okay. everybody ready?

438
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,087
我们出发吧
Let's get started.

439
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:52,038
我们走了
Off we go.

440
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:24,032
Ben  我知道你在这
I know you're down here, ben.

441
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,035
蜷缩在黑暗的角落
Crouching in the dark,

442
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,079
想给我来个黑枪
Just waiting to take a shot at me.

443
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:34,087
这是传送室
This... is "the vault"...

444
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,049
Ben  你最好瞄准我的头
Well, you better aim for the head, ben!

445
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:44,059
就像你的男朋友那样在我背后开枪
You know, like your boyfriend who shot me in the back

446
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:46,020
就象懦夫一样
Like a coward!

447
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:49,097
为了避免把非有机物质留在里面
...to avoid leaving inorganic materials inside...

448
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,092
这盔甲
This body armor's, um,

449
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:55,068
可以同时挡一两颗子弹
Been known to take a bullet or two in its time.

450
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,086
但是Ben  在你射击之前
But before you take your shot, ben,

451
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,021
让我告诉你
Let me tell you about this.

452
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:15,070
你知道吗?  我已经投了一份人身保险  Ben
See that? I took out a bit of a-a life insurance policy, ben.

453
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,092
那是个心率监测器
It's a heart rate monitor,

454
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:24,066
它与调频传送器相连
And it's connected to a radio transmitter.

455
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:27,090
Ben  我们叫它  "死者扳机"
W-we call it a "dead man's trigger," ben.

456
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,089
如果我的心脏停止跳动
If my heart stops beating...

457
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:36,074
它就会向500磅C4炸药传送信号
It sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of c4

458
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:41,062
那些炸药我留在了货轮上
That I've got hardwired out there on the freighter

459
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:45,030
Ben  那样会杀了许多无辜的人
That'd kill a lot of innocent people, ben.

460
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,001
如果你觉得我在虚张声势
If you think I'm bluffing,

461
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,014
那需要我来提醒你
Need I remind you of, uh...

462
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:54,019
你女儿死的时候的样子吗?
How your daughter looked as she bled out?

463
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:57,073
脸向下朝着草地
Facedown in the grass?

464
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,099
你又是谁?
Who the hell are you?

465
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,005
我是John Locke
My name is john locke,

466
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:14,045
我和你无冤无仇
And I have no... conflict with you.

467
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,084
那船上的人也没有
And neither do the people on that boat.

468
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,059
所以...
So...

469
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,018
为什么你不把刀放下?
Why don't you put your knife down?

470
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,098
我们可以谈谈
We can talk about this.

471
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:34,042
好的  John Locke
Well, john locke...

472
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,063
我从来都靠谈话解决问题
I've never really been one for talk.

473
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:47,093
你杀了我的女儿
You killed my daughter.

474
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,066
你杀了我女儿
Aah! you killed my daughter!

475
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:51,096
Ben  停下  不要  停下
Ben! ben! ben, stop! no, no! stop!

476
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:57,091
Ben  你做了什么?
Ben, what did you do?

477
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:05,079
你杀了那船上的所有人
You just killed everybody on that boat.

478
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,091
那又怎么样?
So?

479
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:20,056
