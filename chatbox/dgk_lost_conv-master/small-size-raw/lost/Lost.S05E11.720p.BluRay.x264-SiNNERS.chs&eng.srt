《迷失》前情回顾
Previously on "lost"...

00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:05,007
这是你的女儿
This is your daughter.

00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,006
她叫Clementine
Her name's clementine.

4
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,065
-这些项链是假的  -我要最后那条
-Those are fake necklaces. -I'll take the one on the end.

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:13,019
-为什么帮我  -同是女人
-Why'd you help me? -just one girl

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,022
理应出手相助
Watching another girl's back, I guess.

7
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,056
我有个女儿在Albuquerque
I have a daughter in Albuquerque.

8
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:21,076
-为什么告诉我  -按我说的做  雀斑女
-Why are you telling me this? -just do it, freckles.

9
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,096
应该说他是我的孩子
I think we should say he's mine.

10
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:27,085
还有别的解决方式
There's other ways to do this.

11
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,099
我们已经失去了那么多人
After everyone we've lost,

12
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,014
不能再失去他了
I can't lose him, too.

13
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,015
我的客户坚持要
My client insists that we...

14
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:37,098
私下交接监护权
Handle the exchange of custody quietly.

15
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,090
你会失去这个男孩
You are going to lose the boy.

16
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,012
那是Claire的妈妈
That's claire's mother.

17
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:46,087
Kate和我做的一切  都是为了Aaron
Everything that kate and I have done, it was for aaron.

18
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:49,027
Aaron是谁
Who's... aaron?

19
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,054
我是Ben
I'm ben.

20
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,061
见到你很高兴  Ben
It's nice to meet you, ben.

21
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,082
如果我放你出来
If I let you out....

22
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,008
你能带我去找你的人吗  
Will you take me with you to your people?

23
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:06,031
这就是我的任务
That's why I'm here.

24
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:14,089
Jin  你在这做什么
Jin? what are you doing here

25
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,069
Jin  你在听吗
Hello, jin? are you there?

26
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,036
能听到吗  Jin
Jin?! can you hear me?

27
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,042
我在听
Hello?

28
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,047
Jin  是我  Phil
Jin? it's...it's phil, man.

29
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,062
你去哪里了  敌人跑了
Where have you been? the hostile escaped.

30
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,018
我们在东区搜查
We're searching the east grid.

31
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,020
他往北去了
He's headed north.

32
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:45,024
你怎么知道
How the hell do you know that?

33
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:46,099
他袭击了我
Because he attacked me.

34
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:49,024
什么  你在哪里
What? where are you?

35
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,043
Jin  你还在吗
Jin?! you still there?

36
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,035
Jin  Jin
Jin?  Jin!

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,089
帮帮我
Please help.

38
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:21,078
所有人  听好  放在这边
Okay, everybody, listen up. put it over there.

39
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:24,039
我们不知道是否还会遭袭
We don't know yet if another attack is coming.

40
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,027
所有人都要准备好
So everybody needs to be ready

41
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:28,025
做好安全工作  好吗
For your security assignments, okay?

42
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:31,027
和队长保持联系
Make sure you're in contact with your team leaders.

43
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,043
Lafleur已经派出了搜捕队
Lafleur's got search parties out,

44
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,069
但敌人侥幸逃脱了
But the hostile's got a good jump on us.

45
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,075
可以确定他利用了这堆火
We're pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion

46
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,080
来逃脱
In order to escape.

47
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:45,011
他在说Sayid吗
Uh... is he talking about sayid?

48
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:47,086
如果被锁着  他怎么可能点火呢
If he was locked up, how could he start the fire?

49
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:50,022
你是谁
Who are you?

50
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:53,093
Jack Shephard  我是新来的
Jack shephard. I'm... I'm new.

51
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:58,027
能点起火是因为有人帮了他  
Well, jack, the way he started the fire is he had help, okay?

52
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,000
有人把车点着了
somebody torched that van,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,063
还把他从牢房里放了出来
And then that somebody let him out of his cell.

54
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:06,011
由于监控器没发现有敌人
And since the security cameras didn'tick up any hostiles

55
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:10,028
那个帮手就是我们中的一个
Crossing the perimeter, that means it was one of us.

56
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,052
Baxter  我要清理报告  越快越好
Baxter, I want a full report on cleanup a.s.a.p.

57
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,052
明白  Horace
You got it, horace.

58
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,092
你
Hey, you.

59
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:26,011
就说你呢
Yeah, you.

60
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:29,009
-你负责车库的吧  -是的
-You're in the motor pool, right? -uh, yeah.

61
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,038
能帮我转一下绞轮吗
Do you mind running that winch for me?

62
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,096
根本不知道我在说什么吗
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

63
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:38,013
别担心  只要撬这个杠杆
Okay, no worries. just throw this lever.

64
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,040
我说停的时候  你就拽起来
When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.

65
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:42,085
明白吗  很简单  我说好之前先别动
All right. see? simple. don't do it till I'm ready.

66
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:46,033
好的  开始转吧
Okay. all right, crank her up.

67
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,015
你刚来就被塞到车库了吗
So they just stuck you in the motor pool when you got here?

68
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,073
差不多吧
yeah, pretty much.

69
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:00,078
我也是  等一下  拉住
Yeah, same thing happened to me. wait, hold.

70
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,018
停在那里  很好  就这样
Hold it there. that's good right there. that's good.

71
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:06,016
要是早知道会来做油腻的工人
I guess they couldn't sucker anybody into getting on that sub

72
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,043
没人会被哄上那艘潜艇的
If they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors.

73
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,058
总要慢慢开始嘛
Well, you gotta start somewhere, right?

74
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:13,036
没错  你叫什么
Yeah. what's your name?

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,017
我是Kate
I'm kate.

76
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,073
欢迎入伙  Kate
Welcome aboard, kate.

77
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:19,037
我是Roger  Roger Linus 
I'm roger. roger linus.

78
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,056
很高兴认识你  Roger 
It's nice to meet you, roger.

79
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,044
那是我的孩子
That's my kid.

80
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,092
我的孩子
That's my kid!

81
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,069
小帅哥
Hi, handsome.

82
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,077
睡得好吗
Did you have a good sleep?

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,092
乖孩子
Yeah, that's my boy.

84
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,080
天呐
Oh, my god!

85
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,087
你好  Cassidy
Hi, cassidy.

86
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:54,052
老天  我在新闻上看到你了
Oh, my god! I saw you on the news!

87
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,091
我告诉所有朋友  我认识那女人
I told all my friends, "i know that woman!"

88
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,082
-你好  -这是Aaron
-Hi! -this is aaron.

89
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,022
你好呀  Aaron
Hi, aaron.

90
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,029
说你好
Say hi.

91
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:04,053
你从坠机中幸存了下来
You survived a plane crash.

92
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:08,011
太惊人了  没想到我还能见到你
It's amazing. I never thought I'd see you again.

93
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:10,081
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,054
Sawyer让我来的
Sawyer sent me.

95
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:43,019
Sawyer 那个混蛋还活着吗
Sawyer. So that son of a bitch is still alive?

96
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,055
我离开的时候还活着
He was when I left.

97
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:47,025
他让你来  
And he asked you to come here

98
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,076
给我一信封的钱吗
And give me an envelope full of money?

99
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:54,041
他告诉我怎么找到你
Well, he...he told me where to find you, and...

100
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:57,026
说要好好照顾Clementine
Said to take care of clementine...

101
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:01,008
她正在摇篮里睡着呢  
Well, she's asleep in her crib right now.

102
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,020
要我把她叫醒吗
Want me to wake her up?

103
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:10,012
我不该过来打扰
I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you.

104
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,023
我本应寄过来的  那样更好些
I could've sent it, and I probably should have.

105
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:15,011
为什么告诉我这些
Why did you tell me all this?

106
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:18,007
为什么相信我
Why'd you trust me?

107
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,005
因为我觉得他的女儿  有权知道
Because I thought your daughter had a right to know

108
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,053
他爸爸很想她
That her father cared.

109
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,077
他为什么不和你们一起回来
Why didn't he come back with the rest of you?

110
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:28,010
我们坐的飞机没油了
The helicopter that we were on was running out of gas,

111
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,092
他跳机了
So he jumped

112
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:32,083
这样我们才能坚持到船上
So that we could make it to the boat.

113
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,016
真是懦夫
What a coward.

114
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,087
他只是想做正确的事
He was trying to do the right thing.

115
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,017
他只是想离开你
He was trying to get away from you.

116
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,052
我告诉他  他有个女儿
I told him he had a daughter.

117
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,044
他都不敢抬手给她打个电话
He never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her.

118
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,000
而现在  我得把他当成英雄
So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,076
只因为他让你过来帮我们
Because he told you to come here and help us?

120
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:56,015
这钱都不是他的吧
Hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?

121
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,028
坠机后我们收到一笔抚恤金
They gave us a settlement after the crash,

122
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:04,024
-我用不了这么多  -不用解释  Kate
-And I didn't need it all -you don't have to explain it, kate.

123
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:08,020
你的表情和我被他甩了时一样
You got the same look on your face I did when he ditched me.

124
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:14,009
对你我只有同情
All I have for you is sympathy.

125
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:18,024
是他的吗
Is it his?

126
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,004
什么
What?

127
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,050
你的儿子
Your son.

128
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:23,000
是Sawyer的吗
Is it Sawyer's?

129
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,033
不是
No.

130
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,005
不  我...
No, I was...

131
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,034
在认识他之前就怀孕了
Pregnant before I met him.

132
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,073
那不是你的孩子  对吗
That's not your baby, is it?

133
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:46,026
Kate  你刚刚告诉我你和你的朋友们
Kate, you just told me that you and your friends

134
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,077
向全世界编造了一个故事
Cooked a story for the whole world

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,085
来隐瞒在小岛上发生的事情
About what happened on that island.

136
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:54,016
因此你怎么会对我说真话
So you tell me the truth about that?

137
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,052
关于他  你为什么要对我撒谎
Why are you lying to me about him?

138
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:03,098
因为我不得不这么做
Because I have to.

139
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:30,018
发生了什么事
What happened?

140
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,022
你在这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,088
是Ben  被枪击的孩子是Ben
That was Ben. that kid who was shot was Ben.

142
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,029
是不是Sayid干的  他打了那孩子一枪
Was it Sayid? did he shoot him?

143
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,055
这才是你需要做的  Kate
here's what you need to do, Kate

144
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:40,057
闭上你的嘴不要再问任何问题
Keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions.

145
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:42,029
因为在你身上花功夫
'cause putting any attention on yourself is

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,070
是我现在最不想做的事情  快点走
The last thing I need right now. now scram.

147
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:45,020
我不想让你在这里
I don't want you around here.

148
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,074
我只想知道发生了什么
I just wanna know what's going on.

149
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,016
Lafleur  怎么...
Lafleur. what...

150
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:52,085
怎么  她在这里干什么
What, uh... what's she doing here?

151
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,061
-这是...  -我是Kate
-This is, uh... -I'm Kate.

152
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,078
她是新来的  在车辆调配厂
she's new over at the motor pool.

153
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,055
我只是想看看她有没有看到任何可疑的事情
I was seeing if she saw anything suspicious,

154

她没发现什么  那么你可以走了  谢谢
But she didn't so... you can run along, Thanks.

159
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:22,038
他没有破坏门  是有人放他出去的
He didn't break out. somebody let him out.

160
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,008
那是管理员的钥匙
These are janitor's keys.

好的  我需要你去找到Jack  Hurley和Kate
All right, I want you to find Jack and Hurley and Kate

167
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,077
越快越好  把他们弄到一起  看好
 As quick as you can. put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.

168
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,070
-为什么  -因为我不想跟其他人说话
-What for?  -cause I don't want 'em talking to anybody else.

169
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,005
这里开始失去控制了
Things are starting to spin out of control here.

170
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,005
好的  我知道了
All right, I got it.

00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,080
谁干的  知道是谁对我儿子干的么
Who did this? do you know who did this to my son?

172
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,047
现在我还不知道
Not yet

173
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:02,022
-我们正在查  他怎么样了  -我不知道
-But we're working on it. how's he doing?  -I don't know.

174
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:04,004
Juliet叫我在这里等
Juliet told me to wait out here.

175
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,031
-让我看看能不能给你带来点消息  -谢谢你了  Jim
-Let me see if I can get an update for ya. -Thanks, Jim.

我可能忘在家里了
I must've left them at... at the house.

179
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,072
没关系  别担心
It's all right. don't worry about it.

180
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,011
纱布
More gauze.

181
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,082
-给  纱布  -好的  这里
-Here's some gauze. -Yeah, right here. yeah.

182
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,001
如果我们不能止住出血
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging,

183
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,081
要全都包扎起来  知道么
We're just gonna have to pack the whole tract. okay.

184
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,001
医生在哪
Where's the doctor?

185
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,034
在潜望镜站  星期五才回来
At the looking glass station till friday.

186
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:44,068
-怎么样  -不是很好  拉住
-How is he doing?  -Not well. hook him.

187
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,098
他的什么地方一直在出血  我解决不了
He's still bleeding in there somewhere, and I can't fix it.

188
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:48,005
没关系
It's all right.

189
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:51,057
不  有关系  这里需要人
No, it's not all right. someone needs to get in there

190
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,080
需要有人找到伤口并修复好
Who can find the damage that bullet did and fix it.

191
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,055
他需要一个真正的手术
He needs a real surgeon.

192
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,020
你是说我们被软禁了
You're telling us we're under house arrest?

193
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,070
不  你什么时候想离开都行
No, you're all free to leave whenever you want...

194
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,083
但我会向你的腿开枪
But I'll shoot you in the leg.

195
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,082
谁的主意
And whose idea was this?

196
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:15,063
你认为是谁
Who do you think?

197
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,055
Sawyer只是在做他的工作  Jack
Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.

198
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,082
你在干什么  胖子
What the hell are you doing, tubby?

199
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,021
看我是不是消失了
Checking to see if I'm disappearing.

200
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,050
什么
What?

201
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,000
"回到未来"  伙计
"back to the future," man.

202
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,004
我们回到岛上的时间里
We came back in time to the island

203
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,065
还改变了一些事情  所以如果小Ben死了
And changed stuff. so if little Ben dies,

204
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,078
他永远不会长成大Ben
He'll never grow up to be big Ben,

205
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,062
成为那个一开始带我们回来的人
Who's one who made us come back here in the first place.

206
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:42,054
那就说明我们不在这里  就是说  伙计
Which means we can't be here. and therefore, dude?

207
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,073
我们不存在
We don't exist.

208
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,041
你是个笨蛋
You're an idiot.

209
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:48,080
我是吗
Am i?

210
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,085
不是像你说的那样
Yeah. it doesn't work like that.

211
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,083
你不能改变任何事情
You can't change anything.

212
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,089
你疯狂的伊拉克伙伴射击Linus
You're maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus.

213
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:58,036
这是经常发生的事情  只是...
That is what always happened. it's just...

214
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,088
我们只是没有经历过
We never experienced how it all turns out.

215
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,078
令人困扰
This is really confusing.

216
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,092
我们已经习惯了
Yeah, well, get used to it.

217
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:13,001
但好消息是Linus没有死
But the good news is that linus didn't die,

218
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,001
所以那个孩子也不会死
So that means the kid can't either.

219
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:18,084
-他会好起来的  -那孩子看起来并不好
-He'll be fine.  -Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.

220
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,092
如果你错了会怎样
What if you're wrong?

221
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:22,089
如果我错了  我想我们会停止存在下去
Well, if I'm wrong, then I guess we all stop existing,

222
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,058
所有的事都无所谓了  对吗
And none of it matters anyway then, does it?

223
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,020
医生  需要你跟我来一下
Doc, I need you to come with me.

224
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:35,065
-跟你去哪  -Juliet说孩子在流血
-Come with you where?  -Juliet said the kid's losing blood

225
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,062
我们却没办法输给他任何东西
And we ain't got none to put back in him.

226
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:38,063
所以我们需要你找出来出血的地方
So we need you to show us where he sprung a leak.

227
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,083
不
No.

228
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,022
不  我不跟你去
No, I'm not coming with you.

229
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,066
如果你不来  Jack  那个孩子会死的
If you don't come with me, Jack, that kid's gonna die.

230
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,034
那就让他死吧
Then he dies.

231
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,018
你在做什么
What are you doing?

232
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,068
做点三明治
Making some sandwiches.

233
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,037
我想大家到现在都饿了
I figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now.

234
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,025
他只是个小男孩  Jack  
He's just a boy, Jack.

235
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:34,000
你不能让他就这么死了
you can't just let him die.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,097
你听到Miles的话了  
You heard Miles.

237
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,072
我们改变不了任何已经发生的事情
we can't change what's already happened.

238
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,066
这不关我的事
This has nothing to do with me.

239
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:43,082
除非你是那个本该去救他的人
Unless you're the one who's supposed to save him.

240
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:47,034
三十年后  这个孩子会成为一个男人
30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man

241
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,036
因为他需要手术而把我关起来
That locks me in a cage because he needs surgery.

242
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,086
然后你进来
And then you're gonna come in

243
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,075
求我去给他做手术
And you're gonna beg me to operate on him

244
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:56,051
因为他威胁到Sawyer
Because he's threateni to murder Sawyer.

245
00:14:56,093 --> 00:15:00,020
我已经做过这种事情了
I've already done is once.

246
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,038
我已经救过一次Benjamin Linus
I've already saved Benjamin Linus

247
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,088
我是为你而做的  Kate
And I did it for you, Kate.

248
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,043
我不需要再做一次
I don't need to do it again.

249
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,009
这是我们的错误
This is our fault.

250
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:15,030
我们把Sayid带了回来  我们导致的这件事情
We brought Sayid back. we caused this.

251
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:16,067
你知道  我们来这之前
You know, when we were here before

252
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,030
我花了所有的时间去弥补一些事情
I spent all of my time trying to fix things.

253
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,063
但...你有没有想过
But... did you ever think

254
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:24,068
只是这个岛自己想去搞定
That maybe the island just wants to fix things itself?

255
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,075
而我可能
And maybe I was just...

256
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,058
在碍事
Gettin' in the way?

257
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,079
我不喜欢现在的你
You know, I don't like the new you.

258
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,008
我喜欢以前
I liked the old you,

259
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,024
那个不会坐以待毙的你
Who wouldn't just sit around and wait for things to happen.

260
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,006
你不喜欢以前的我  Kate
You didn't like the old me, Kate.

261
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,023
你去哪
Hey! Where are you going?

262
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:05,062
放松
Just relax.

263
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,055
你没事的
You're okay.

264
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,017
打扰一下  Juliet
I'm sorry. Juliet?

265
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,022
来了个新人
One of the new people is here.

266
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:18,002
她听说Ben需要输血  她说她是万能供血者
She heard Ben needed blood, says she's a universal donor.

267
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,069
可能会疼一下
This might hurt for a second.

268
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,067
很好 真勇敢
Good. Very brave.

269
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:38,022
James告诉我Jack不会帮忙
So James told me that Jack wouldn't help,

270
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:39,052
但他没说原因
But he didn't say why.

271
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,025
如果我知道Jack为什么做那些
If I understood why Jack does what he does,

272
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,090
我也一定不会待在这
I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.

273
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:48,001
离开岛后  你们俩有没有进展
Off island, did something happen with you two?

274
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,091
我们订婚了
We were engaged.

275
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,007
这算吗
Does that count?

276
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:00,032
-怎么回事  -Roger  我让你在外面等着
-What's going on?-Roger, I asked you to wait outside.

277
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,074
不  我的孩子怎么了
No, what's going on with my kid?

278
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:02,040
Kate在为我们提供血液
Kate is giving us some fresh blood

279
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:05,071
才能为Ben输血
So we can transfuse ben.

280
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,005
我不会就在外面等着
Well, I'm not waitin' outside.

281
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:11,064
他可以和我在一起  你去照顾Ben
You know, he could stay with me, and you could check on ben,

282
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,056
Roger陪着我
And...and Roger here could keep me company,

283
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,085
确保我不会昏倒
Make sure I don't pass out.

284
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:21,021
好吧  Roger  坐下吧
Okay. roger, have a seat.

285
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,085
-谢谢  -应该的
-Thanks. -Sure.

286
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,070
他偷了我的钥匙
He stole my keys.

287
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,071
什么
Sorry?

288
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,066
Lafluer问我  我的钥匙在哪里
Lafleur asked me where my keys were.

289
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:42,049
那杂种没问其他问题 他不知道答案
That bastard doesn't ask any questions He doesn't know the answers to...

290
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:46,006
这意味着我儿子偷了钥匙
Which means my son stole my keys

291
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:47,096
他放走了那个混蛋
So he could bust that animal out of jail.

292
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,015
他为什么这么做
Why...why would he do that?

293
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,061
因为我
Because of me.

294
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:00,085
你有孩子吗
You got kids?

295
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,055
没
No.

296
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,062
我曾以为我可以是最棒的父亲
I thought I was gonna be the greatest father ever.

297
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,059
你知道吗
You know?

298
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,081
我想这没实现
I guess it didn't work out that way.

299
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,000
他妈妈呢  她还在这吗
What about his mother? Is she still around?

300
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,021
不  死了
No, she's dead.

301
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,080
她在分娩那天就死了
She died the day he was born.

302
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,039
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,048
是啊  我也是
Yeah, me, too.

304
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,056
我一直都很努力
I tried to do

305
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:38,025
去做我认为她希望我去做的事
What I thought she'd want me to do,

306
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:40,073
但
But...

307
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:43,093
我想一个男孩子还是需要母亲的
I guess a boy just needs his mother.

308
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,097
-怎么了  -他缺氧性休克了
-What's going on?-He's going into hypoxic shock.

309
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:55,010
什么意思  他怎么了
What does that mean?What's the matter with him?!

310
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,024
他需要更多的氧气
He needs more oxygen.

311
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,028
Roger出去
Roger, get out of here!

312
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,067
-什么  -把他弄出去
-What?-Get him out of here!

313
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,071
等等  怎么了  等等
Wait! what...what is... wait a minute.

314
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:02,038
Roger请在外面等着
Please, roger, just wait outside.

315
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,004
我们直说
Let me get this straight.

316
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,057
这些都是已经发生的事了
All this already happened.

317
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,063
是的
Yes.

318
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,027
所以现在我们的谈话
So this conversation we're having right now...

319
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:16,098
已经发生过了
We already had it.

320
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,036
是的
Yes!

321
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,033
-那我下面该说什么  -我不知道
-Then what am I gonna say next?-I don't know.

322
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,028
那么你的理论就错了
Ha! Then your theory is wrong!

323
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,099
说了千遍了
For the thousandth time, you dingbat,

324
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,072
我们的谈话已经发生过了
The conversation already happened,

325
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,075
但不是对我们俩而言
But not for you and me.

326
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:34,070
对我们俩而言  现在才发生
For you and me, it's happening right now.

327
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:38,000
好吧  回答我
Okay, answer me this.

328
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:40,071
如果这些对我都发生过了
If all this already happened to me,

329
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:43,067
那么  为什么我什么都不记得了
Then... Why don't I remember any of it?

330
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,090
因为Ben曾经转过那轮子
Because once Ben turned that wheel,

331
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:50,010
对我们来说
Time isn't a straight line

332
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,080
时间不是直线型的
For us anymore.

333
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,030
我们过去的经历在未来 
Our experiences in the past

334
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,025
而未来
And the future

335
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:59,007
在现在以前发生
Occurred before these experiences right now.

336
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:04,059
再说一遍
Say that again.

337
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,048
用枪杀了我吧  拜托了
Shoot me. please. please?

338
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:13,074
我不能杀了你
Aha! I can't shoot you.

339
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,082
因为如果你在1977死了的话
Because if you die in 1977,

340
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:18,046
那你就不能在30年后坐船
Then you'll never come back to the island on the freighter

341
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,096
-去岛上  -我能死
-30 years from now.-I can die

342
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:23,020
因为我已经坐船去了岛上
Because I've already come to the island on the freighter.

343
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,055
我们中的任何人都可以死
Any of us can die

344
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,039
因为这是我们的现在
because this is our present.

345
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,081
但你说Ben不会死  因为他还要长大
But you said Ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up

346
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,089
成为小岛居民的首领  因为这才是他的过去
And become the leader of the others. Because this is his past.

347
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:36,093
但是当我们抓住Ben  Sayid折磨他
But when we first captured ben, and sayid, like, tortured him,

348
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,098
那么他为什么不记得
Then why wouldn't he remember

349
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:43,053
当他是孩子时  被同一人射中
Getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?

350
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,086
我没想过这个
I hadn't thought of that.

351
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,052
他怎么样了
How is he?

352
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:13,078
-他稳定下来了  -他不会有事吧
-He's stable.-Is he gonna be okay?

353
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,085
他输过血了
He's got some fresh blood running through him,

354
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:16,029
这是好事
Which is a good thing.

355
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,058
Roger  你要去医疗救护站
Roger, I need you to go out to the medical station.

356
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:21,013
他们那里有  我们没有的设备
There are some supplies there that we don't have here.

357
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:26,041
好的  我想说  我想说谢谢
Okay. hey, I just wanna say, i-i... I wanna say thanks.

358
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,011
我知道你尽力
I know that you're doing everything you can...

359
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,069
去救他
To save him, and...

360
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,041
好的  我这就去  好吧
All right, I'm...i'm gonna go, okay?

361
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:44,049
他好点了没
Is he any better?

362
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:47,066
他情况稳定了
He is stable now.

363
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:50,085
但我不能
But I can't, um...

364
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,059
我治不好
I can't fix it.

365
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,048
潜艇呢  我是说  能不能把他带走
What about the sub? I mean, can we take him somewhere?

366
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,090
不  它离开了  几个月内它不会回来的
No. it's gone.It won't be back for a couple of months.

367
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,059
但他不会死
But he can't die, right?

368
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,078
他会死的
He is going to die.

369
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:04,007
他在一个没有条件的救护站里
He is in a medical situation that is not resolvable.

370
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,068
好的  我们不能无所事事
Okay, well, we can't just sit here and do nothing.

371
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:07,039
一定有人能帮助他
I mean, there's got to be someone who can help him.

372
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,093
我们有整个
We have entire...

373
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,031
什么
What?

374
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:23,013
或许他们可以做些什么
Maybe there's something they can do.

375
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,046
他们
"they"?

376
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,093
"其他人"
The others.

377
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,024
你抱好他了吗
You got him?

378
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:48,030
是的  准备好了吗  好的  1  2  3   走

I'm coming with you. no, no, no, no. if something goes wrong

381

或者我们被抓  我无所谓
Or we get caught, it doesn't matter for me,

382
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,065
你的生活就不复存在了
But you've got a whole life here.

383
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,084
而且如果Sawyer知道我让你卷入了这些
And besides, if sawyer knew that I got you involved in this,

384
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:13,014
他饶不了我  你打算怎么办
He'd kill me. how are you gonna manage?

385

我会处理的  别担心

Kate  Sawyer会发现Ben不见的

387
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:23,026
如果他发现了  我不得不告诉他发生了什么

不过我会尽量为你拖延时间

你知道这件事  不  我

你就是因为这个假装关心Aaron

说服我回到那  我没假装做任何事
To convince me to go back there?! I wasn't pretending anything.

Jack说我们不应该离开那

我把他弄丢了

00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,091
我不知道发生了什么  我们在超市
I don't know what happened. we were in the supermarket,

448
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:20,011
我就回了一下头  他就不见了
And I turned around for one second, and he was gone.

449
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:26,056
最疯狂的是
And, you know, the crazy thing is, is that...

450
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:29,019
我很害怕
As scared as I was...

可是我一点都不惊讶
I wasn't surprised.

452

453
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,013
为什么我会这样想
Why would I feel that way?

454
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,085
为什么我就想到他有可能是被带走了
I mean, why would I expect him to be taken?

455
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,037
因为你带走了他  Kate
Because you took him, kate.

456
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,041

想想办法
Figure out

464

你该怎么把他带出这里

其他人在另一边

当我发现Ben不见了

471
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,077
Juliet告诉我你带走了他
And juliet told me what you were up to,

472
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,080
我也问这个问题
I asked that exact damn question...

473
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,054

Why are you helping ben?

474
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,096
她说
And she said...

475
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,024
不管这孩子长大时什么样
No matter what he's gonna grow up to be,

476
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,042
都不应该让他死
It's wrong to let a kid die.

477
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:14,085

Jack在哪

我想他在洗澡

找他有事吗  我有事要跟他说

488

我需要你帮忙  那孩子是Ben

Juliet  对不起  我不能帮你

我不是请你帮忙  Jack
I'm not asking for your help, jack.

492
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,024
你很明显不感兴趣
You made it pretty clear you weren't interested.

493
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:28,069
Sawyer和Kate正在帮他
It's up to sawyer and kate now.

494
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:31,086

500
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:47,053
这三年来我们过的很好
We've been fine for three years.

501
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:50,035

小孩么  什么事情都可能做

512
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,027
如果他被惹怒了的话
If he's pissed off enough at his folks.

我一点都不适合当你男友

当飞机失事时  你女儿怀孕8个月了

她丢下了孩子  我们四处寻找

我开始照顾Aaron

568
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:19,017

我们要决定该对他怎么办

我是说
What I mean is that...

608
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,085
他会忘了所发生的一切
He'll forget this ever happened, and that...

609
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,094
他不会再那么天真
His innocence will be gone.

610
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:24,070
他永远是我们的一员

Richard
Richard...

614
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:47,092
你应该问问Ellie
You shouldn't do this without asking Ellie.

615
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:50,035
如果Charles发现了  那就随他去

我不会回答他们的
I don't answer to either of them.

617
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,029
你要带他去哪
Wh-where are you taking him?

618
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:00,039
别跟着了
Come on.
