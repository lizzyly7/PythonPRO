00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,670
"迷失" 前情提要...
Previously on "Lost"...

- 他是谁?  - 他叫Richard Alpert
- Who is he?  - His name is Richard Alpert.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,200
是个... 顾问
He's a kind of... advisor.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,060
他干这行已经很久了
And he has had that job for a very, very long time.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,530
你为何想死?
Why do you want to die?

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,340
我将我...
I devoted my life...

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,310
长到你无法想象的生命...
longer than you can possibly imagine...

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,460
奉献给那个
in service of a man

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,580
告诉我事出皆有因的人
who told me that everything was happening for a reason,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,720
他说他有一个计划... 我也在计划之内...
that he had a plan... a plan that I was a part of...

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,500
但现在那个人死了 所以我为何想死?
And now that man's gone. So why do I want to die?

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,380
因为我发现 我已经失去生活的目标了
Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,770

抱歉 我无法使你快速康复

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,120

很高兴见到你...

15
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,360
我来 是因为我需要你的帮忙
I'm here because I need your help.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,720
Ilana 你会帮我吗?
Will you help me, Ilana?

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,850
嗯
Yes.

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,160
我要你帮我保护6个人
There're six people I need you to protect.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,720
我会把他们的名单给你
I'm gonna give you a list of their names.

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,040
要你帮忙的就是这事
This is what you've been preparing for.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,550
这些人... 是谁?
These people... who are they?

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,330
他们是保留下来的接班人
They're the remaining candidates.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,670
接班人?
Candidates?

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,500
什么接班人?
Candidates for what?

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,260
接替Jacob的人
To replace Jacob.

26
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,030
他说我是其中之一
She said I was one of them.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,390
你也是 还有Hurley也是
And so are you, and so is Hurley.

28
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,190
哦 这敢情好 那我们现在该干嘛?
Well, that's great. So what do we do now?

29
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,440
我不知道
I don't know.

30
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,060
那谁知道?
Then who does?

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,330
等我把他们带去寺庙后...
After I've brought them to the temple...

32
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,430
我该干什么?
what do I do?

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,680
问Ricardus
Ask Ricardus.

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,410
他知道接下来该怎么做
He'll know what to do next.

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,670
Ricardus是谁?
Who's Ricardus?

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,160
就是他
He is.

37
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,580
那么 Richard...
So, Richard...

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,580
我们接下来该干嘛?
what do we do next?

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,630
我不知道"我们"接下来要干嘛
I have no idea what "we" do next.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,370
你没告诉你的朋友们
You didn't tell your friends

41
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,880
当你找到我的时候 我正打算自杀么?
that I was trying to kill myself when you found me?

42
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,850
这听上去 像主事人会去做的事吗?
Does that sound like someone who has a plan?

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,000
那为何Jacob说你知道后续步骤 如果...
Why would Jacob say you knew what to do if...

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,850
因为他说的一切都是谎言
Because everything he ever said is a lie.

45
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,370
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,040
Jack 你想不想听个秘密?
You wanna know a secret, Jack?

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,850
一个我知道多年的秘密?
Something I've known a long, long time?

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,910
你死了
You're dead.

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,560
- 你是在打比喻吗?  - 不 我说的就是字面上的意思
- You mean that figuratively, right?  - No. I mean, literally.

50
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,920
我们都死了... 包括这里的每一个人
We're all dead... every single one of us.

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,490
至于这里? 这里的... 一切? 并不是你们看到的这样
And this? This... all this? It's not what you think it is.

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,580
我们没在岛上 我们从来没上过岛
We're not on an island. We never were.

53
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,510
我们在地狱
We're in hell.

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,800
所以我对Jacob说的话 一点儿兴趣也没有
So I'm not interested in what Jacob said.

55
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,980
事实上 或许我们该把他的话抛之耳后
In fact, maybe it's time we stopped listening to him

56
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,910
转而去听其他人的
and we started listening to someone else.

57
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,200
我也正打算这么做
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:04:00,200

迷失 第6季第9集

59
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,850
你在干嘛?
What're you doing?

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,910
- 我去把Richard追回来  - 追他干嘛? 你听到他说的话了
- I'm going after Richard.  - Why? You heard him.

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,070
他不... 他不知道我们接下来该干嘛
He doesn't... he doesn't know what we need to do next.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,080
他知道 Jacob跟我说过 他知道的
He knows. Jacob told me. He has to know.

63
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,380
Alpert精神不正常
Alpert has lost his mind.

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,340
他以为我们... 我们身处地狱
He thinks that we're... we're in hell.

65
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,070
如果他在乎Jacob说的话
And if he care about what Jacob said,

66
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,840
他不会说... 去听别人的话
he wouldn't be talking about... about listening to someone else.

67
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,010
等等
Wait.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,300
你知道他指的是谁?
You know who he meant?

69
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,310
哦 这下好玩了
Oh, this should be interesting.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,730
什么
What?

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,880
他是指Locke
He meant Locke.

72
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,230
Locke死了啊
Locke is dead.

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,520
他指的不是真正的Locke 如果这能安抚你的话
If it's any consolation, it's not exactly Locke.

74
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,980
Hurley啊
Hurley.

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,030
他在说什么?
What's he sayin'?

76
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,120
呃 谁... 在说什么?
Uh, wh... what's who saying?

77
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,600
- Jacob 我看到你在跟他说话  - 我没在和Jacob说话
- Jacob. I saw you talking to him.  - I'm not talking to Jacob.

78
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,080
别骗我 拜托 如果你知道些什么...
Don't lie to me. Please, if you know something...

79
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,190
- 或者任何能帮我们走出困境...  - 兄弟 和我说话的不是Jacob
- Anything that can help us figure out...  - It's not Jacob, man.

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,930
那是谁?
Then who is it?

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,420
抱歉 Jack 这与你无关
Sorry, Jack, but this has nothing to do with you.

82
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,060
- Shephard说得没错  - 没说错什么?
- Shephard is right, you know.  - Right about what?

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,460
Richard 追他回来只是浪费时间
Richard. Going after him is a waste of time.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,570
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,180
- 你怎么这么肯定?  - 我12岁起就认识他了
- What makes you so sure?  - I've known him since I was 12 years old.

86
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,580
这多少也能说明些事吧
That should count for something.

87
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,230
你们还是孩子的时候 就认识了?
So you guys met when you were kids, huh?

88
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,520
不 Frank 那时我年纪尚小
No, Frank, I was a kid.

89
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,550
而Richard的模样 却和今天别无二致
Richard looked just like he does today.

90
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,400
你是说他长生不老?
You're saying this guy doesn't age?

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,980
我就是这个意思
That's exactly what I'm saying.

92
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,450
那你觉得这到底是怎么回事?
And how the hell do you think that happened?

93
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,600

1867年 加那利群岛之一 特尼里弗岛

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,600

Ricardo 你是吗?

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,860

嗯 是我

96
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,050

Isabella 你继续睡吧

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,060

你发烧了...

98
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,070

我没事

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,420

我去找医生

100
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,300

上帝保佑 我天亮前回来

101
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,110

希望能赶得及

102
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,540

把这个给医生吧...

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400

不 Isabella...

104
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,640

拿着吧 亲爱的

105
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,310

要是你有什么意外的话...

106
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,420

闭上眼

107
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,450

我们的心永远在一起

108
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,870

我不会让你有事的

109
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,580

你不能进去!

110
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,910

你不能进来...

111
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,560

抱歉 但我等不及了

112
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,100

我妻子病得很重 大夫

113
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,450

给他几床毯子

114
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,820

谢谢您 大夫

115
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,850

不是给你的...

116
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,240

你身上的水 滴到我地板上了

117
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,180

我妻子在咳血...

118
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,290

她需要您... 求您了 大夫

119
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,190

你们住在哪儿?

120
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,310

El Socorro附近

121
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,440

El Socorro吗?

122
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,560

到那儿要半天呢

123
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,510

这种倾盆大雨的日子

124
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,960

一路上我可受不了

125
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,660

我有药...

126
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,070

可以救她的命...

127
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,440

但要价很高

128
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,940

嗯 没问题 能救她就行 谢谢您 大夫

129
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,310

你只有这点儿钱?

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560

就只有这些了

131
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,340

这东西一钱不值

132
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,660

求求您 求求您 大夫...

133
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,230

我可以做工还债的 求求您了!

134
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,330

别拉着我!

135
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,580

放手!

136
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,880
Isabella啊
Isabella.

137
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,980
Isabella啊
Isabella.

138
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,080
Isabella啊
Isabella.

139
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,580
不 不 不
No, no, no.

140
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,630
Isabella啊
Isabella.

141
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,950
不!
No!

142
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,280

我给你带了点儿吃的 孩子

143
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,610

我不饿 神父

144
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,390

或许待会儿就饿了呢

145
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,790

你那本"圣经" 可以给我看一下吗?

146
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,110

是英语版的啊

147
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,980

嗯... 我在自学

148
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,680

Isabella... 我妻子和我曾想去"新世界"旅游

149
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,950

我们想生个孩子

150
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,050

开始新生活

151
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,600

你准备好忏悔了吗?

152
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,730

神父 请原谅我犯下的罪行

153
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,510

神父 我...

154
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,160

杀了人

155
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,100

我罪孽深重

156
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,950

神父 求求您...

157
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,700

请上帝宽恕我吧

158
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,380
不
No.

159
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,720

什么?

160
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,630

你犯的是谋杀罪 我不能赦免你

161
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,490

神父 那只是个意外

162
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,400

我不是故意要杀他的

163
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,710

但你的确把他杀了

164
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,850

求求您 神父...

165
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,540

一定还有别的方式 能得到上帝的宽恕

166
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,910

要重获上帝的恩宠 只有以苦行赎罪

167
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,460

嗯 这是肯定的... 我什么都愿意做

168
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,880

可是你没时间赎罪了

169
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,340

因为明天

170
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,520

你就要上绞刑架了

171
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,450

可怜啊 孩子...

172
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,340

恐怕魔鬼 早已在地狱等着你了

173
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,550

愿上帝宽恕你的灵魂

174
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,370

把他的眼睛蒙起来

175
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,860

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,080
我在问你 会不会说英语?
I asked, do you speak English?

182
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,810
把他带走 换一个人过来
Take him away and bring me another.

183
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,100
- 给他去受绞刑吧  - 会 我会说! 我会说!

Wait.

185
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,390
你的手挺粗壮的 过去是干什么的?
You have strong hands. What sort of work did you do?

186
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,350
我... 我是做... 我是做... 我... 在地里劳作
I... I work... I work... I... in the fields.

187
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,080
听说你想去"新世界" 是吗?
I understand you're interested in going to the New World. Yes?

188
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,010
是的
Yes.

189
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,050

今天就是你的幸运日 谢谢你 神父

191
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,940
这个人现在归Magnus Hanso船长所有了
This man is now the property of Captain Magnus Hanso.

192
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,710
希望你别晕船哦
I hope you don't get seasick.

193
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,070

你看见什么了吗?

194
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,790

太黑了

195
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,190

等等 我看见陆地了!

196
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,640

我看见海岸了

197
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,930

是个岛

198
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,200

我看见了魔鬼!

199
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,030

这个岛是魔鬼的领地!

200
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,040

上帝宽恕我们了

201
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,460

至少宽恕了部分人

202
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,270
看见什么东西了吗?!
Do you see anything?!

203
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,020
- 把船长给我找来  - 长官 Hanso船长死了
- Bring me the captain.  - Sir, Captain Hanso's dead.

204
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,610
天啊 我们身陷诡谲丛林之中!
Good God, we're in the middle of a bloody jungle!

205
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,890

求你了 别杀我
No lo haga, por favor.

226
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,500
我们的船在丛林中撞毁
We are shipwrecked in the middle of the jungle.

227
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,270
我们没有水源
We have no fresh water

228
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,450
补给有限
and limited supplies,

229
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,140
只剩下五个船员
and there are only five officers left.

230
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,090
不! 不! 不!
No! No! No!

231
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,240
为什么... 你为什么要这么做?
Why... why are you doing this?

232
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,520
因为如果我放了你们
Because if I freed you,

233
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,290
时间一长
it would only be a matter of time

234
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,760
你们就会杀了我
before you tried to kill me.

235
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,690
不!
No!

236
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,460
上面发生什么事了?
What happened up there?

跟我汇报!
I said report!

238
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,550

出去!

239
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,780

我会杀了你的!

240
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,890

我会杀了你的!

241
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,290

喂?

242
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,610

有人吗?

243
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,610

有人吗?

244
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,290

Ricardo啊...

248
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,920

我不明白... 你怎么... 在这儿?

249
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,380

你还不明白吗 Ricardo? 我们死了 两个人都死了

250
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,950

我们在地狱

251
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,330

我得在他回来之前 救你出去

252
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,180

什么?

253
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,010

在谁回来之前?

254
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,370

恶魔

255
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,880

恶魔?

256
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,450

我从他的眼睛里... 看到的就是魔鬼

257
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,190

你见过他吗 Ricardo?

258
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,410

是 我想我见过...

259
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,130

我们得离开这儿...

260
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,720

快走!

261
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,350

快走 马上!

262
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,650

亲爱的 快走!

263
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,870

快走 现在就走!

264
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,640

我不能...

265
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,660

亲爱的 我说过我不会让你有事的!

266
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,670

我说过不让你有事 就不要你出事 亲爱的

267
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,260

求你了!

268
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,070

我怕...

269
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,010

如果你爱我 就快走!

270
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:31,900

快走!

271
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,800
不 不
No, no.

272
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,720

放开她!

273
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,470

放开她!

274
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,120

求你放开她!

275
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,290
Isabella啊!
Isabella!

276
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,340
Isabella啊!
Isabella!

277
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,710
别怕 看这儿
Shh. Here.

278
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,630
喝点水
Water.

279
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,790
谁...
Who...

280
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,240
谁... 你是谁?
Who... who are you?

281
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
一个朋友
A friend.

282
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,840
我是...
I am...

283
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,470
在地狱吗?
in hell?

284
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,280
是的 恐怕是的
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

285
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,760
你...
You...

286
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,780
你不是船上的人
You are not on the ship.

287
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,460
早在你们的船失事之前...
I was here...

288
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,990
我就在这个岛上待着了
long before your ship.

289
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,020
你... 你...
Did... did...

290
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,490
你看到我的... 我的妻子没?
did you see my... my wife?

291
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,120
- 谁?  - Isabella 我妻子
- I'm sorry?  - Isabella. My wife.

292
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,740
她本来在这里 她...
She was here. She was...

293
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,280
但... 后来那股黑烟来了
But... then the black smoke came,

294
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,810
她就跑开了
and she ran.

295
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,330
然后再没回来?
And she hasn't come back?

296
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,700
那也许代表他抓住了她
That probably mean he has her.

297
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,760
谁?
Who?

298
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,790
我想你知道是谁
I think you know who.

299
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,340
如果她还活... 活着 我得救她
If she's a... alive, I must save her.

300
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,130
求你 拜托 帮帮我
Please. Please, help me.

301
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,310
当然 当... 当然我会帮忙
Of course. Of... of course I'll help.

302
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,580
我也想要自由
I want to be free, too.

303
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,600
碰巧...
As luck would have it...

304
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,980
我在外面船员的身上 找到了这个
I found these on one of the officers outside.

305
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,140
我想我可以打开你的锁
I think they'll work.

306
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,720
但是在我开锁之前 你得答应帮我
But before I try, I need to know that you will help me.

307
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,240
好的 好的 当... 当然
Yes. Yes. Of... of course.

308
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,390
我说什么 你都会照做吗?
You'll do anything I ask?

309
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,420
是的 是的 一切照做 我发誓
Yes. Yes, anything. Yes, I promise.

310
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,490
那就成交
Then we're agreed.

311
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,530
谢谢
Thank you.

312
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,840
不客气 我的朋友
Of course, my friend.

313
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,690
很高兴见到你 脱离锁链的束缚
It's good to see you out of those chains.

314
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,530
谢谢
Thank you.

315
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,600
我们得让你先站起来
Let's get you on your feet.

316
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,940
如果我们打算逃离 你得先恢复力气
You're gonna need your strenth if we're going to escape.

317
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,270
逃离?
Escape?

318
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,680
对的
That's right.

319
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,260
要逃离地狱 恐怕只有一条路
I'm afraid there's only one way to escape from hell.

320
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,480
你得杀了那个恶魔
You're going to have to kill the devil.

321
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,380
等你吃完
When you're finished eating,

322
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,740
你就朝西一直走
you'll walk due west.

323
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,340
一旦你走到海边
Once you get to the ocean,

324
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,450
就能看到雕像
you'll be able to see the statue.

325
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,300
雕像?
The statue?

326
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,960
你们的船在开进来的时候 撞上它了
Your ship smashed through it on its way inland.

327
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,350
把它撞得粉碎
Broke it into pieces.

328
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,600
在那儿 你能找到那个恶魔
That's where you'll find the devil.

329
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,280
你只有一次机会
You only have one chance.

330
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,110
把这个刺进他的胸膛
Put this through his chest.

331
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,330
别犹豫 别让他开口说一个字
Do not hesitate. Do not let him say a word.

332
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,340
如果他一开口 就晚了
If he speaks, it will already be too late.

333
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,960
他很擅长游说
He can be very persuasive.

334
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,720
我... 我怎么能用这个杀了他?
How... how can I kill him with this?

335
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,530
他... 他是... 一股黑烟
He... he is... black smoke.

336
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,400
不
No.

337
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,770
我才是
I am.

338
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,900
我的妻子Isabella...
My wife Isabella...

339
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,440
她是想躲开你?
She was running from you?

340
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,550
她是想躲开他
She was running from him.

341
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,250
对不起 我看到他把她带走
I'm sorry. I saw him take her,

342
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,910
但是我阻止不了他
but I couldn't do anything to stop him.

343
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,980
但是... 但如果你是那股黑烟 你...
But... but if you are the black smoke, you...

344
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,210
朋友 不止你一个人失去了重要的东西
You aren't the only one who's lost something, my friend.

345
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,840
那个恶魔背叛了我
The devil betrayed me.

346
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,090
他拿走了我的肉身
He took my body,

347
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,320
我的人性
My humanity.

348
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,030
你... 你杀了船上那些船员
You... you killed the officers on the ship.

349
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,650
你该担心的人不是我
I'm not the one you need to worry about.

350
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,620
是那个恶魔带走了你的妻子
The devil has your wife,

351
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,460
如果你想抢回她
and you are going to have to kill him

352
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,770
就必须杀了他
if you ever want to get her back.

353
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,080
谋杀是不对的 它让我饱尝了今日的恶果
Murder is wrong. That is what brought me here.

354
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,140
我的朋友...
My friend...

355
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,790
咱俩可以花一整天 来讨论什么是对 什么是错
You and I can talk all day long about what's right or wrong.

356
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,600
但你面对的问题 始终如一
But the question before you remains the same.

357
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,720
你到底还想不想 再见到你的妻子?
Do you ever want to see your wife again?

358
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,310
嗯 我想
Yes, I do.

359
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,760
啊!
Uhh!

360
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,290
啊!
Uhh!

361
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,760
啊!
Uhh!

362
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,820
你在这儿干嘛?! 谁给你的这个?!
What're you doing here?! Who gave you this?!

363
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,320
我妻子在哪?
Where is my wife?

364
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,930
什么?
What?

365
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,860
我妻子在哪?
Where is my wife?

366
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,430
我... 我不认识你妻子
I... I don't know your wife.

367
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,030
- 她乘这艘船过来的吗?  - 不 她死了
- Did she come here on the ship?  - No. She's dead.

368
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
那你为什么问我她在哪?
Then why are you asking me where she is?

369
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,610
你在丛林里 有遇见一个黑衣人吗?
Did you meet a man in the jungle dressed in black?

370
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,510
是的
Yes.

371
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,790
他跟你说了什么?
What did he tell you?

372
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,350
他说你是恶魔
He said you are the devil.

373
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,290
然后呢?
And?

374
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,920
他说我只有杀了你
He said the only way I would see my wife again

375
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,550
才能再见到我的妻子
is if I kill you.

376
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,040
我... 我在这里看到她...
I... I saw her here...

377
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,330
就在这儿 她在哪儿?!
In this place. Where is she?!

378
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,130
- 那不是你的妻子  - 是的 那就是!
- That wasn't your wife.  - Yes, it was!

379
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,490
- 她死了 跟我一样  - 你没死
- She is dead, just like me.  - You're not dead.

380
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,020
我... 我在地狱 我知道我在地狱!
I... I am in hell. I know that I am in hell!

381
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,240
- 你真认为你已经死了?  - 要不我现在是在哪?
- You really think you're dead?  - Where else would I be?

382
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,410
那好
All right then.

383
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,080
你要干嘛? 你要干嘛?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

384
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,130
不 不 不 不!
No, no, no, no!

385
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,800
- 还认为你已经死了?!  - 啊!
- Still think you're dead?!  - Aah!

386
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,590
啊!
Aah!

387
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,890
- 还认为你已经死了?!  - 住手!
- Still think you're dead?!  - Stop!

388
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,930
我为什么要住手?!
Why should I stop?!

389
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,000
因为我不想死!
Because I want to live!

390
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
这是你说过的唯一清醒的话
That's the first sensible thing you've said.

391
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,470
你叫什么?
What's your name?

392
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,870
我叫Ricardo
Ricardo.

393
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:53,920
好 Ricardo
Ricardo.

394
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,610
起来 我们得聊聊
Get up. We need to talk.

395
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,720
那里面有什么?
What is inside?

396
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,610
除非我邀请 否则谁也别想进去
No one comes in unless I invite them in.

397
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,550
你是恶魔吗?
Are you the devil?

398
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,790
不
No.

399
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,570
那你是谁?
Then who are you?

400
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,590
我叫Jacob
My name is Jacob.

401
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,540
是我 把你们的船引到这岛上来的
I'm the one who brought your ship to this island.

402
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,230
你把我们弄过来的?
You brought it here?

403
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,230
为什么?
Why?

404
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,550
把这瓶酒 想象成你一直说的"地狱"
Think of this wine as what you keep calling "Hell."

405
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,450
它还有很多别名
There's many other names for it, too.

406
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,330
"恶毒"
"Malevolence."

407
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,120
"邪恶"
"Evil."

408
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,580
"黑暗"
"Darkness."

409
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,300
看这儿 它在瓶子里打转
And here it is, swirling around in the bottle,

410
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,290
却出不去
unable to get out,

411
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,960
因为如果它出去了 它就会到处肆虐
because if it did, it would spread.

412
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,690
这个软木塞...
The cork...

413
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,690
就好比这座小岛
is this island.

414
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,580
只有它能够将黑暗势力困在...
And it's the only thing keeping the darkness...

415
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,400
它该在的地方
where it belongs.

416
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,360
那个派你来杀我的男人
That man who sent you to kill me

417
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,940
认为所有人都是堕落的
believes that everyone is corruptible

418
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,390
因为人性本恶
because it's in their very nature to sin.

419
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,220
我把人们引到这岛上来 想证明他是错的
I bring people here to prove him wrong.

420
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,300
一旦他们到了这里 他们的过去就不再重要了
And when they get here, their past doesn't matter.

421
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,040
在你把我的船引到这儿以前 还有过其他人?
Before you brought my ship, there were others?

422
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,850
对 有很多
Yes. Many.

423
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,090
- 他们后来怎么样了?  - 他们都死了
- What happened to them?  - They're all dead.

424
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,450
可如果是你把他们弄来的 你为什么不帮他们?
But if you brought them here, why didn't you help them?

425
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
因为我希望他们能自力更生...
Because I wanted them to help themselves...

426
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,480
学会明辨是非
to know the difference between right and wrong

427
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,930
而不是非得由我去告诉他们
without me having to tell them.

428
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,740
如果我强迫他们去做事情 那一切就没意义了
It's all meaningless if I have to force them to do anything.

429
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,560
我为什么非得插手呢?
Why should I have to step in?

430
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,930
你要是不插手 他就会插手啊
If you don't, he will.

431
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,390
你想找个活儿干吗?
Do you want a job?

432
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,370
什么? 找个活儿?
What? A job?

433
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,440
干什么?
Doing what?

434
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,210
嗯...
Well...

435
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,550
如果我不想插手这档子事
If I don't want to step in,

436
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,260
也许你可以替我援助他们
maybe you can do it for me.

437
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,850
你可以做我的... 我的代表...
You can be my... my representative...

438
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,540
做我和那些人的中间人
an intermediary between me and the people

439
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,590
- 那些被我带到岛上的人  - 那 我能换到什么好处?
- I bring to the island.  - Well, what will I get in return?

440
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,510
- 随你说  - 我想要我妻子活过来
- You tell me.  - I want my wife back.

441
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,780
我做不到
Can't do that.

442
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,370
你能赦免我的罪过 让我不用下地狱吗?
Can you absolve me of my sins so I don't go to hell?

443
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,610
这我也办不到
I can't do that either.

444
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,120
那我永远也不想死 我... 我想永生
Then I never want to die. I... I want to live forever.

445
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,230
这个
Now that...

446
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,330
我答应你
I can do.

447
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,610
你让他开口说话了 是吗?
You let him talk to you, didn't you?

448
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,130
他让我给你这个
He told me to give you this.

449
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,830
我想你明白 要是你跟他走
I'm sure you realize that if you go with him,

450
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,430
你就再也见不到你的妻子了
you'll never be with your wife again.

451
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,080
我理解
I understand.

452
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,090
他很擅长...
He can be very...

453
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,320
游说人
convincing.

454
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,100
但我想让你知道 如果你改变主意...
But I want you to know if you ever change your mind...

455
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,570
我是说不论何时...
and I mean ever...

456
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,170
我和你的交易始终有效
my offer still stands.

457
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,050
我有样东西要给你
I have something for you.

458
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,120
你肯定是不小心弄掉了
You must have dropped it.

459
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,310
我在船上找到的
I found it on the ship.

460
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,710

亲爱的 再见了

461
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,200
我改变主意了
I've changed my mind.

462
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,170
你听见了吗?
Are you listening to me?

463
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,080
我改变主意了
I've changed my mind.

464
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,630
我以前错了!
I was wrong!

465
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,130
你说过 我可以改变主意的
You said I could change my mind.

466
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,830
你说过 交易始终有效的!
You said the offer would stand!

467
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,250
那个交易还算数吗?
Does the offer still stand?

468
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,650
那个交易还算数吗?!
Does the offer still stand?!

469
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,530
那个交易还算数吗?!
Does the offer still stand?!

470
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,670
什么交易 老兄?
What offer, dude?

471
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,230
你怎么会在这儿? 你跟踪我?
What the hell are you doing out here? Did you follow me?

472
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,980
- 嗯 差不多  - 走... 走开! 滚!
- Well, kinda.  - Get.. get out! Get out!

473
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,690
喂!
Hey!

474
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,680
- 你没... 你没听见我说的吗?!  - 我只是...
- Did... didn't you hear what I said?!  - Look, I was just...

475
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,910
- 我跟你们的人说了 我什么也不知道!  - 老兄 冷静点!
- I told you people, I don't know anything!  - Dude, just calm down!

476
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,520
- 你干嘛跟踪我?!  - 是你妻子让我来的!
- Why did you follow me?!  - Your wife sent me!

477
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,870
你说什么?
What did you say?

478
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,040
我说 是你妻子让我来的 Isabella啊
I said your wife sent me. Isabella.

479
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,530
她想知道 你为什么把她的十字架埋起来
She wants to know why you buried her cross.

480
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,440
你... 你是怎么知道的?
H... how do you know about that?

481
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,010
- 因为是她刚才告诉我的  - 什么叫 刚才告诉你的?
- Because she just told me.  - What do you mean, just told you?

482
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,830
Isabella看见你把十字架挖出来了 老兄
Isabella saw you dig it up, man.

483
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,970
她现在就站在你身边
She's standing right next to you.

484
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,100
