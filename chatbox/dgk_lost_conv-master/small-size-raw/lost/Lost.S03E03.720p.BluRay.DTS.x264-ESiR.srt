156
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:10,020
你最好别和我一起  CHARLIE.
You don't want to go with me, Charlie.

157
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,027
我身边的人都没有好结果
Bad things happen to people who hang around with me.

158
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,013
你好  Bobby

然后你会知道该做什么

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,060
关于你的人生--该选择什么方向

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,000
进去找到方向

167
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
这里的农民和猎人都喜欢这样

168
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:14,082
你是前者还是后者  John?

00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,089
它怎么变成这样的?
What's left of it.

这里看起来好像--
Looks like it...

203
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,029
发生过爆炸
imploded.

204
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,059
是什么?
What is that?

205
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,059
捕食
It's an active kill.

206
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,059
意味着刚才在吃这个的动物
Meaning that whatever was eating this

207

会带更多同类回来

209
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:13,037
没错  是北极熊
All right. Polar bear.

210
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,033
快跑
Run!

211
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:59,007
老兄...
Dude.

212
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,097
他们留下了Jack  Kate  Sawyer
They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer,

213
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:06,075
放我回来告诉剩下的人
And they sent me back to tell everyone else

214
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,024
叫我们别到他们的地方去
that we can't ever go over there.

215
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,039
老兄  我在那边的时候看到Henry了
Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch--Henry?

216
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,089
好像是他们的头
He was there. He's, like, their leader.

217
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,096
那么...我们该怎么办
So... what do we do?

218
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,090
照他们说的办
Do what they told you.

219
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,017
回露营地去告诉剩下的人
Go back to the camp and tell the others.

220
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,070
你不采取行动吗?  什么都不做?
You're not gonna do anything?

221
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,077
我正在行动  你回海滩去  HUGO
I am doing something.Go back to the beach, Hugo.

222
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,073
等一下  你们到哪里去
Wait. Where are you guys going?

223
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:38,040
这个岛告诉Locke他得去救Eko
The island told Locke he has to save Eko.

224
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,090
为什么要救他?
Save him from what?

225
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,090
很显然他被一只熊抓了
Well, apparently a bear's got him.

226
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,003
而且那只熊刚刚还在捕食
It's just made an active kill.

227
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,040
你可能想快点回去了
You may want to hustle.

228
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,033
熊?
Bear?

229
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,021
什么熊?
What bear?

230
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,049
什么?  又是毛吗?
What's that, more fur?

231
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,079
走这边
This way.

232
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,069
有一次我吸毒后
When I used to get high,

233
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:26,069
看了"BEEB"(电视台)的自然节目
I'd watch nature programs on the "beeb."

234
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,090
节目里面说北极熊很聪明
Polar bears are meant to be quite clever.

235
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,073
非常聪明
Very clever.

236
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:36,093
他们像是熊里面的--爱因斯坦
They're like the Einsteins of the bear community.

237
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,043
她喜欢你  伙计

238
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,077
-嘘  -真的  她喜欢你
Oh, yeah, she does.

239
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:06,031
-胡说  -真的
- She does not.   - Yeah, she does.

240
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:09,011
她的年纪只有我的一半  你应该去约她
She's like half my age, man. You'd be better off with her.

241
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,077
不  Lizzie不是我喜欢的类型
No. Lizzie's too granola for me.

242
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:14,048
她真正需要的是父爱
What she really wants is a daddy.

243
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:16,010
就像这里其他人一样
Like everyone else here.

244
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,050
你应该利用你的优势
You should take advantage of that.

245
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,083
这很无聊Eddie
That's not real funny, Eddie.

246
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:24,010
开玩笑而已  只是开开玩笑
It was a joke.It was a joke!

247
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,050
对不起
I'm sorry.

248
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:32,002
你怎么从来没有说起你父亲John
How come you never talk about your dad, John?

249
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:34,092
没什么好说的
Nothing worth talking about.

250
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:43,020
那边在干什么?
What's going on in that greenhouse over there?

251
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,022
我去帮他们搬肥料
Maybe they need a hand with that fertilizer.

252
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,032
不  不  不  他们自己能行
No, no, they're okay. They're okay.

253
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:51,032
我们还是管好果园
Come on. We got orchard duty.

254
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:01,029
你们到底有什么秘密John
What's the big secret, John?

255
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,085
什么?
Sorry?

256
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:04,055
-什么?  -温室
The greenhouse.

257
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:05,073
你们到底藏了什么
What do you guys got in there? What are you hiding?

258
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:07,003
每次我走进温室的时候--
'Cause every time I go near it,

259
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:09,003
你和其他人的表情都很怪
you and everyone else acts all weird.

260
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:11,055
你是我们的客人  这些事情我们要慢慢告诉你
Look, you're a guest here.These things take time.

261
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,090
我来这里都六个星期了
I've been here for six weeks.

262
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,026
-Eddie  那里什么都--   -我不是瞎子伙计
- Eddie, nothing's--   - I'm not blind, man.

263
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:18,060
你记得你带我来这里的时候车后面放了一麻袋枪吗
Did you forget that you had a duffel
 bag full of guns When you brought me here?

264
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,045
Mike和Jan很欢迎你来
Mike and Jan welcomed you here with open arms.

265
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,027
他们给你吃的
They feed you.

266
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,014
-给你住的地方   -Mike和Jan
- They give you a place to stay...- And Mike and Jan

267
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:30,030
每次吃饭以前都说我们怎么怎么是一家人
fold their hands every night before chow and talk about how we're family,

268
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,009
但你们之间还有这么多秘密
but your family's got too many secrets.

269
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:39,034
我看到肥料搬进温室以后终于知道是怎么回事了
Now I see the fertilizer going into that greenhouse.I know what's going on...

270
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:41,079
而且我想加入你们
and I want in.

271
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,015
加入什么?
In on what?

272
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,072
你们偷偷摸摸干的大事情
Whatever you guys are trying to blow up.

273
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:54,082
什么事情这么好笑?
What's so funny?

274
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:58,061
没什么
Nothing.

275
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:01,049
我和Mike还有Jan商量一下
I'll talk to Mike and Jan.

276
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:13,011
你真的觉得Eko在这里面?
You really think Eko's in there?

277
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:17,054
我们快点进去吧
Let's hurry up and do this.

278
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:19,025
可能熊还在外面吃饭
Maybe the bear's out finishing his lunch.

279
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:22,035
-你不能进去Charlie   -什么?
- You're not going in there, Charlie.  - What?

280
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:24,068
我一个人进去
I'm gonna do this alone.

281
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:26,065
你没必要告诉我我该做什么
You don't tell me what I can't do.

282
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:27,090
如果我想进去我就要进去
If I want to, I'll go in there.

283
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,020
-为什么?      -什么?
- Why?       - What?

284
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,022
-你为什么想进去    -没有为什么
Why do you want to go in there?

285
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,022
-那就回去  -回去?
- Then go back.  - Go back?

286
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:36,055
你也没有理由进去
You don't have a good reason to go in there, either.

287
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:40,051
我要进去因为我应该进去
I'm going in there because I'm supposed to go in there.

288
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,043
按照计划--
If it all goes to plan,

289
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,093
我们应该不会碰到熊  对吗?
we probably won't even see the bear, will we?

290
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:50,086
希望它不要发现我们
Hopefully he won't smell us.

291
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,038
发胶?  很抱歉
Hair spray? Now I hate to be the one

292
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,015
-我不是针对你  -这不是给我用的
to point this out to you--- It's not for me.

293
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,061
熊?
Bear?

294
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,051
是你吗?
Is that you?

295
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,095
谁在那里?
Who's there?

296
00:26:57,095 --> 00:27:00,095
你是一个人吗兄弟?
Are you alone, brother?

297
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:03,071
对...是啊
Yeah.

298
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:07,051
老兄  我不是一个人
Dude. I'm not alone.

299
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,063
露营地就在那边
The beach camp's right over there.

300
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,090
你可以帮我那些衣服过来吗?
Can you get me some clothes?

301
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,023
你的衣服呢?
What happened to yours?

302
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:20,019
我在丛林里醒来就这样了
I woke up in the jungle like this.

303
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,056

So...

你在舱门里面...
like, the hatch...

305
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:29,013

00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:55,066

Go on in.

316
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,015
-所有的现金都装带齐了吗? -在包里

317
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,002

318
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:03,015
-银行记录怎么办?   -别管它
- What about the bank records?  - Leave 'em.

319
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:06,009
-如果他们在里面找到痕迹怎么办?  -没时间了Mike
Shouldn't we sort out what they can trace?  -There is no time, Mike.

320
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,049
-怎么了? -你看不到吗?
What's going on?What does it look like?

321
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,069
我不知...
I don't...

322
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,090
你搞砸了John  你把我们都害了
you screwed up, John.You blew it big time.

323
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,036
你们在...
What are you-- what...

324
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,031
你们在干什么?
What are you doing?

325
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:23,068
你们要离开了吗?
Are you leaving?

326
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:26,054
为什么?这就是为什么你这个白痴!
- Why?  - That is why, you idiot!

327
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:27,099
John  你的朋友是个警察
John, your friend's a cop.

328
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,030
你知道我们会因为这些毒品坐多久牢吗?
You know how much jail time we'd get for this much weed?

329
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,035
照得不错吧  他是个刚从警校毕业的小子
Nice picture, huh? Got him fresh out of the academy.

330
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,015
不 他只是个搭便车的
No, he was-- He was hitchhiking.

331
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:36,058
他给我说他是要去Eureka
He told me he was going to Eureka.

332
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:38,058
他设好圈套等着你的John
He was waiting for you, John.

333
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:40,082
在这六个星期里他已经收集好证据了
He has been here for six weeks gathering evidence

334
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:43,064
-都是因为你  -这不可能
because you brought him here.- No, Mike, that's impossible.

335
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:47,077
他骗得你像个傻子  现在我们全都完了
He played you for a sucker.  -Now it's over.

336
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,076
不  等一下
No. Wait.

337
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:54,020
等一下  别收拾了!
Wait. No, wait, wait. Stop!

338
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:55,090
我们不知道他给他们说了什么
We don't know what he's told 'em.

339
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,064
他到现在都还没有进过温室
He hasn't even been in here yet.

340
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,094
如果他还在收集证据准备立案
If he's still gathering evidence and trying to make a case,

341
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,061
-那就还来得及 -来得及什么?
- then it's not too late. - Not too late for what?

342
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,071
保护我们  保护我们所有人
To protect us. To protect all of us.

343
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:08,079
现在干还不晚  我可以办到的
It's not too late to fix this.I can fix this.

344
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:13,018

How are you gonna do that, John?

345
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,015
Eko?

346
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,008
John...

347
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:31,025
他没事吧?  他还活着吗
Is he okay?He alive?

348
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:34,098
把他翻过来  把他翻过来
Turn him over, turn him over.

349
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:37,025
Charlie  我们得离开这里
Charlie, we gotta get outta here.

350
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:41,062
好  把他扶起来
Okay. Let's get him up.

351
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:49,034
你说"转动钥匙"
So, when you say "turned a key,"

352
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,094
那是把什么钥匙?
you mean, like, a key key?

353
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:53,011
那是把应急钥匙
It was a failsafe key.

354
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,021
挺方便嘛
That seems kinda convenient.

355
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,051
什么?
I'm sorry?

356
00:31:57,051 --> 00:32:00,043
我是说你有这把神奇的钥匙--
I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time,

357
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,043
为什么却不喜欢用
why didn't you, like, use it?

358
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:03,098
我不知道用了以后会发生什么
I didn't know what would happen.

359
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:05,047
结果发生什么了?
So what did happen?

360
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,007
这把应急钥匙试舱门内电磁异常
Well, the failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly,

361
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:11,031
舱门里面结果爆炸了
made the hatch implode.

362
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:14,054
但你没有被炸
But you didn't implode.

363
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,026
是啊
yeah

364
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,003
你不会..突然就跑到那废船里面去了吧
You're not gonna, like,turn into the Hulk or something?

365
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:24,050
那就是那声巨响--
So is that what made the blender noise

366
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,051
和天色发紫的原因?
and the sky turn purple?

367
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,021
恐怕我错过了这些情节兄弟
Afraid I missed that, brother.

368
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:31,012
对  你当时在应急
Right. You were failsafing.Well, F.Y.I.,

369
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:33,052
整个岛都震动了
the whole island vibrated,

370
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,095
Kate  Jack和Sawyer也看到了
and Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too,

371
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,056
在他们被抓走之前
right before they had bags pulled over their heads--

372
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:42,099
别担心  Locke演讲的时候说了他会去找他们的
Don't worry.Locke's gonna go after them.He said so in his speech.

373
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:46,086
什么演讲?什么?
-What?What speech?

374
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:50,096
他只是说他去把熊杀了救Eko回来
All he said was he was gonna save Eko and kill bears.

375
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:54,083
没错
Right.

376
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,086
没错...当然
Right, of course.

377
00:32:57,086 --> 00:33:00,083
对不起  我...
I'm sorry. I...

378
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,083
我不是很清醒...
I'm just, uh, a bit shook up.

379
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,056
我把那头熊烧得挺厉害的
I burned that bear pretty good.

380
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,056
我认为它不会来追我们
I don't think he's gonna be coming after us.

381
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:24,019
现在我们在这次自杀性任务中幸存了
Now that we've survived this suicide mission,

382
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,021
你愿意告诉我你看到什么了吗?
do you wanna tell me what you saw?

383
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:28,028
我看到了什么?
What I saw?

384
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:30,044
在你那个神秘的帐篷里
In your spirit tent.

385
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:33,004
我看到Boone了
I saw Boone.

386
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:37,035
Boone?

387
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,039
他说什么了?
What did he have to say for himself?

388
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,014
他对我说我收拾我留下的惨剧
He told me I had to clean up my own mess.

389
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:45,038
他可能没有死吧
Well, dead as he may be,

390
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,001
不管怎么样我同意他的说法
I agree with Boone.

391
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,035
如果你照Eko说的继续按按钮--
After all, if you kept pressing that button like Eko told you to--

392
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:51,069
我们现在根本就不用救他
We wouldn't have had to save him in the first place,

393
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:55,056
对Charlie 那就是"收拾你自己留下的残局"的意思
yeah, charlie, that's what cleaning up your own mess means.

394
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:01,091
听起来好像有很多残局啊(mass和mess谐音)
Spoken like someone who's had a few too many messes to clean.

395
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,001
没有发现鹿吗?
No deer, huh?

396
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:17,034
没有
no

397
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:21,001
你跟Mike还有Jan说了吗?
You talk to Mike and Jan yet?

398
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,088
对  当然说了
Yeah, sure did.

399
00:34:22,088 --> 00:34:24,088
他们觉得怎么样?
Yeah? What'd they say?

400
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:28,051
他们叫我今晚吃完饭以后带你到温室里去
They said that I should bring you by the greenhouse tonight after supper

401
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:31,081
他们会告诉你你想知道的事情
and that they would explain everything.

402
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,090
酷
Cool.

403
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,067
太棒了
That's great.

404
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:41,027
你看到什么东西了吗?
What, did you see something?

405
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:45,080
John

406
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,060
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

407
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,046
你知道会是我吗?
Did you know it would be me?

408
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:57,014
什么?
What?

409
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:00,041
你知道我会开着货车经过吗?
In the truck. Did you know it would be me driving?

410
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,091
是他们选的我吗?
Did they choose me?

411
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:06,061
他们?  我不知道你在说什么John--
They? John, I have no idea what you're talking about--

412
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:10,011
我没有给那把枪上子弹
I didn't load that one.

413
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:17,094
回答我的问题好吗Eddie?
So how about you just answer the question, Eddie?

414
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,052

00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:23,016
他们选了你John
They chose you, John.

416
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,002
为什么?
Why?

417
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,006
因为你来这里没多久
Because you hadn't been here long,

418
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:31,016
没有犯罪记录  长官说
didn't have a criminal record,and the psych profile said

419
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:34,046
你可以当污点证人
you would be amenable for coercion.

420
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:38,016
污点证人...
Amenable for coercion--

421
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,022
放下枪John
Lower the gun, John.

422
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,032
好吗?  我只是办公事
Okay? This isn't personal.

423
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:47,012
这是我们之间的事!
It's not personal?!

424
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:54,030
停下来  停下来
Stop, stop.

425
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,053
对不起John  你不会开枪的
I'm sorry, John, but you're not gonna shoot me.

你不是谋杀犯
You're not a murderer.

427
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,096
你是个好人
You're a good man.

428
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:05,010
一个农民
You're a farmer.

429
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:07,026

00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,052
我不是农民
I'm not a farmer.

431
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:12,007
我曾经是个猎人
I was a hunter.

432
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,014
现在也是
I'm a hunter.

433

00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:48,074
John  你听到了吗?
Hey, John. You hear something?

435
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:52,064
好像附近有河
- It sounds like a stream.

436
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,070
把他放下来
Let's put him down.

437
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,019
也许我们应该给他点水
Maybe if we get some water in him.

438
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:12,078
我去  你在这里等
I'll go. You stay here.

对不起对这个岛失去信念
Sorry I gave up on my faith in the island.

442
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:46,079
我把事情都搞砸了
I messed up.

443
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,032
现在我们的人被抓了
Now our people are captured and...

444
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,064
如果我听你的--
if I'd just listened to you,

445
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:56,004
如果我让你--
if I'd just let you...

00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:59,010
继续按按钮...
keep pushing the button...

00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,037
我可能就会和他们一起去了
I could've gone with them,

448

你会找到他们的
You will find them.

454
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,010

你是个猎人John
you are a hunter, John.
