1
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:05,075
两天前我发现我有癌症
Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

2
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:08,014
接着突然出现了一个外科医生

3
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:10,090
我们有一个很好的击败你的计划
We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,046
我完美的计划曝光了
My wonderful plan got shot to sunshine

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,045
当你看到我的X光片发现我快死了的时候
when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying.

6
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,071
你想让我救你的命?
You want me to save your life?

7
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:21,069
我想让你自己想救我的命
I want you to want to save my life.

8
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,096
你考虑一下好吗
All I can ask is that you think about it.

9
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,032
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME AGAIN

10
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,020
BUT THIS TIME

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,093
SLOWLY

12
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:41,036
'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING TOO FAST

13
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:44,084

00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,024
COME ON AND SQUEEZE ME AGAIN

15

SLOWLY

17
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,010
'CAUSE I LIKE YOUR GRASP

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,097
OH,OH,OH

19
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:59,062
BUT IT'S MUCH TOO FAST

20
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:05,085
YOU SAID THAT OUR LOVE WILL GROW TOGETHER

21
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:09,005
'CAUSE YOU'RE MINE,ALL MINE...

22
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,046
警察  开门
Police. Open the door.

23
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:21,042
我这里没有什么情况
Everything's all right in here.

24
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,063
女士  我们有证据表明
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

25

酒店里有很危险的任务
someone extremely dangerous is in the motel.

26

-我们正在搜查每个房间-屋里只有我一个人  警官
-We're conducting a room-to-room search.-I'm alone, officer.

27

这个人可能正拿枪指着你
This person could be holding you at gunpoint,

28
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,085
强迫你说只有你一个人  请开门
forcing you to say that. Please open the door.

29
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,014
我不认为我应该开门
I don't think I should.

30
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:37,054
三秒钟后不开门我就把门撞开
Ma'am, you have three seconds before I break this door down

31

那就给我弄一块
Then get me one

你想让我觉得自己很能干?
What, you trying to keep me feeling productive?

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,079
你做了这份验血报告  然后在上面标注符号?
You took these blood tests,made all the notations?

48
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,013
这些X光片是什么时候拍的
How old are the x-rays?

49
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,095
一周前
A week.

50
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:07,047
从这张片上看你脊柱上的肿瘤有边缘形  不宜动手术
The tumor on your spine is borderline inoperable,

51
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,065
按照肿瘤扩展的速率来看

52
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:13,004
边缘形一个星期就会消失
that borderline goes away in about...one week.

53
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:25,050
那天那个手术室--设备齐全吗?

是

我没有说我会给你动手术
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,082
我只是想让你知道你会怎么死
I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die.

63

相信只要我动了手术

00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,052
然后  希望  你会放我走?

你不该来这里
You shouldn't have come here.

真的吗?
Seriously.

82
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,058
婚礼之前看到新娘会倒霉的
it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.

83
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,073
婚礼前看到新娘
It's bad luck to see the bride

84
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:25,025
穿着衣服才会倒霉
in her dress before the wedding.

85
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:27,071
而你呢  没穿衣服
You, my friend, are naked.

86

你试过了吗?
Have you tried it on?

87
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,051
我要摒住呼吸
I have to hold my breath

88
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:37,069
才能扣上扣子
to get the claspy things to clasp,

89
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,080
所以还是等到婚礼前几分钟才穿吧
so I'm waiting till the absolute last minute.

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,065
还有12个小时了  可能你应该试穿一下了
It's in about 12 hours.You might wanna get clasping.

如果他不干活  我也不

不Sawyer  我们是一个团队

上帝知道我不会拆散团队
Lord knows I wouldn't want to break up the team.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,039
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

109
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,056
应该是被动物袭击了
Must have been an animal,

110
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:47,093
可能是一只熊
maybe one of the bears.

111
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,068
我们把他抬回去吗?
Are we gonna carry him back?

不  我们就把他埋在这里
 No We're gonna bury him here.

是吗?
Are we?

114

露营地的人...
The people back at camp...

115

最近经历了太多葬礼

没有人需要看到他这个样子
Nobody needs to see him like this.

117
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,019
我会溜回露营地拿几个铲子
I'll slip back to the beach and get a couple shovels.

118
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,010
-我和你一起去-不  我一小时后回来
I'll come with you.- No, I'll be back in an hour...

谢谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern.

121
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:27,042
到底是什么东西杀了Eko?
So what killed Eko?

122
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,027
露营地的人们管它叫"怪物"
Folks back at the beach call it the "monster."

123
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:36,032
我不知道那应该叫什么
I don't really have a name for it.

124
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,078
你不相信有怪物
You don't believe in monsters.

125
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:41,015
我相信我看到的
I believe in what I can see.

126
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,050
很明显你知道那是什么
But obviously, you have.

127
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,069
为什么不告诉我你的看法?
So why don't you tell me what you think it is?

128
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,011
那可能是带我们来这里的东西
It might be what brought us here.

129
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,017
你确定那是怪物?
So you believe that this monster

130
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:55,093
-所以你认为这个怪物决定了Eko注定要死?-我相信Eko的死是有原因的
decided that Eko was meant to die?-I believe Eko died for a reason.

131
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,076
只是现在我还不知道是什么原因
I just don't know what it is yet.

132
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,059
所以你就说谎吗?
Is that why you lied?

133
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:06,015
我们不是回露营地对吗  John?
We're not headed back towards the camp,are we, John?

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,046
当然是
Sure, we are.

135
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,013
只是需要绕几个道
Just need to take a little detour first.

136
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,092
(围墙被破坏)
<i>Compound breach.</i></i>

137
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,057
-(围墙被破坏)-她在哪里?
<i>Compound breach.</i>Where is she?</i>

138
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:28,061
有人在输电网那里  让他趴下  她也是
Someone's on the grid.I want him on the ground, her too.

139
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:30,068
如果他乱动就开枪
If he moves, you shoot him.

140
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:33,083
-对  他们在这里-好的
- Yeah, they're here.-<i>- Okay.</i></i>

141
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:37,041
医生又出来了?  你确定?
Did the doctor get out again?You sure?

142
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,030
那他知道吗?
Well, does he know?

143
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,071
她是怎么到这里来的
How the hell did she get over here?!

144
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,055
站起来  快  站起来  快跑
Get up! Come on! Get up! Go!

145
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,045
Alex!  Alex!

146
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,074
-你知不知道你在干什么?-怎么?  你会开枪打我吗?
-What the hell do you think you're doing?-What, you gonna shoot me?

147
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:54,046
你知道你不应该来这里的  现在冷--
You know you're not supposed to be here,so let's just calm...

148
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:57,086
Danny  你把他怎么样了?  他现在在哪?
what did you do to him, Danny?!Where is he?

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,066
我要跟Ben谈谈
I want to talk to Ben.

150
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,083
没问题  这听起来是个好主意
Sure.That sounds like a great idea.

151
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,050
现在我们应该把弹弓放下来--
So why don't we just lower our little sling--

152
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,020
他在哪里!  告诉我!
where is he? Tell me!

153
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,016
-不!  放开我!-带她离开这里
Don't-- no! Get off of me!

154
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,061
-怎么处理她-带她离开!
- What do I do with her?- Get her out of here.

155
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:15,043
放开我!  听着  他们说的任何话都不能相信
Put me down!Listen, whatever they say,don't believe them.

156
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,053
他们会杀了你的男朋友
They're gonna kill your boyfriend

157
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,089
就像杀了我的男朋友一样
just like they killed mine.

158
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:41,099
我不明白  应该还有两周的
I don't understand.It's supposed to be two weeks.

159
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,099
-我们的计划提前了-什么?  这是命令吗
-Our schedule's been moved up.- Is that an order?

160
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:45,085
-是他的计划-真蠢
-It's coming from him.- That's stupid.

161
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,002
不是我说的
It's not my call.

162
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,036
没有办法  Danny
That's the way it is, Danny.

163
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,071
好吧
All right.

164
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,055
你可以带上这个--
I would like for you to put this on

165
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,073
跟我来吗?
and come with me, please.

166
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,059
你认为我会带上一个麻袋
You think I'm gonna put a hood over my head

167
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,000
-就因为你说了一个"请"-不  Kate  我认为你会带上麻袋
'cause you said "please"?
No, I think you're going to put a hood over your head

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,058
因为站在我身后的人 在我身后凶神恶煞的那个--
because the man standing behind me,the one who's burning a hole in my back--

169
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,076
他会杀了Sawyer
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

170
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:14,051
但如果你带上这个跟我来
But if you put this on and you come with me,

171
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,003
你就可以为我们做点事情
there's something you can do for us

172
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:18,001
并且救他的命
that will save his life.

173
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,041
进来
Come in.

174
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,068

外面有很大一群兴奋的警察
There are a lot of excited policemen.

别担心  我告诉过他们
Don't worry. I have asked them

180
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,064
当你说"我原意"的时候不准朝天上开枪
not to shoot their guns in the air when you say "I do."

181
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:29,031
想不到婆婆对人这么好
You know, mothers-in-law aren't supposed to be so nice.

182
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,017
Monica...
Monica...

183
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,067
我有东西要送给你
I have something for you.

184
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,015
Suzanne  你不应该这样
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

185
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,099
这是我结婚时我妈妈给我的
My mother gave that to me on my wedding day.

186
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,023
她说有一天我会把这个给我的女儿
She told me someday I'd give it to my daughter,

187
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:51,082
但我生了四个男孩...

191
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,006
还只有这么点高
since he was about yea high.

192
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,050
当我第一次看到你的时候  Monica
When I first met you, Monica,

193
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,061
我被你的诚恳和对Kevin的忠诚打动了
I was struck by your honesty and devotion to Kevin.

194
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,010
我问她最爱你哪个地方的时候
And when I asked him what he loved most about you,

195
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,029
他说"所见即所得"
he said,"because what you see is what you get."

196
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,029
好了
That being said,

197
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,025

我不知道为什么  但很累
I don't know what it is,but it's big.

舱门爆炸的时候
When the hatch exploded,

282
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,084
你用来祈祷的棒子从书上掉到我面前
your prayer stick fell out of a tree right on top of me.

283
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:38,035
我和Sayid把它找来
So Sayid and I went out to get it,

284
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:41,048
因为我们觉得应该把它和你埋在一起
because it didn't feel right to bury you without it.

285
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:45,089
我认为你的死是有原因的Eko先生

我告诉他他必须做
I told him he had to.

299
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,049
你为什么做这么傻的事?
Why the hell would you do something so stupid?

300
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,050
-就你的命-我不需要你救我

301
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,088
你想死?!
You wanna die?!

302
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:09,023

00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,007
闭嘴  James
Shut up, James.

310
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,045
你不想Jack救你的命
You don't want Jack to save your life?

311
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,044
那你自己救你的命
Then you're gonna save your own.

312
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:37,054
我们现在就离开这里
We're getting outta here now.

313
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,088
停下  混蛋  Kate!
Stop it! Damn it, Kate.

314
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:45,056
走  离开这里  快跑!
Go. Get outta here. Run!

315
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,086
你走出了笼子  你为什么不逃跑  Kate?
You're out of your cage.Why don't you run, Kate?

316
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:52,015
我--我不逃跑...
'Cause me...I ain't running...

317
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:55,093
因为我们根本逃不掉
'cause there ain't no place to go.

318
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,054
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

319
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,080
我们不是在以前的那个岛上
We ain't on our island.

320
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,009
我们在另外一个岛
We're on another island,

321
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,015
就像恶魔岛一样  中间隔了几英里
like Alcatraz,couple miles offshore.

322
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:10,081
除非你是美人鱼  或者你会游泳
So unless you're a mermaid,or you got a boat,

323
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,057
我们是跑不掉的
there ain't no point.

324
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,044
你之前准备什么时候告诉我这些
When were you planning on telling me this?

325
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:17,023
不告诉你
Never

326
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:20,042
为什么?!为什么你要这样?
Why not?!Why wouldn't you?!

327
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,088
因为我想让你觉得
'cause I wanted you to believe

328
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:29,037
我们还有希望
that we had a damn chance.

329
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,026
这是干什么?
What was that for?

330
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,000
我不知道
I don't know.

331
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:02,091
我不知道
I don't know.

332
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,005
真不错
Very nice.

333
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,007
现在轮到你了
Okay, now it's your turn.

334
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,091
看看你桌布下面
Look under your place mat.

335
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,073
你干了什么?
What did you do?

336
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:27,038
看看就知道了
Just look.

337
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:30,068
-这是什么? -记得我们的蜜月吗?
What is it?You know that honeymoon

338
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:32,065
我已经拖了六个月了?
I've been promising you for six months?

339
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:35,082
你现在手上拿的是两张到哥斯达黎加的机票
You are holding in your hand two tickets to Costa Rica.

340
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:38,030
准备好你的护照吧  宝贝
So get your passport ready, baby.

341
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,033
怎么了?
What's wrong?

342
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,010
没什么
Nothing.

343
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:53,012
我太爱你了
I just love you so much.

344
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:58,058
过来
Come here.

345
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,048
我问你点事情  小妞
Let me ask you something.

346
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:37,033
上次那家伙打我的时候
The day blockhead was beating on me,

347
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,020
你说...
and you said...

348
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,055
"我爱你"
"I love you."

349
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:47,037
只是为了...让他停止  是吗?
That was just...to get him to stop, right?

350
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:24,000
我也爱你
I love you, too.

351
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,021
谁在那边?
Who is this?

352
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,016
喂?
Hello?

353
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,090
喂!
Hello?

354
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,045
去检查一下门
Try it... the door.

355
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,083
想不到这样能促进感情  我也很惊讶
If it helps, I was surprised, too.

356
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,095
如果我是个赌徒
If I were a betting man,

357
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:47,069
-我会下注把你和她关进去更有可能-闭嘴
-I would have picked her and you.- Shut up!

358
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:54,092
我想这个东西
Well,I suppose this would be

359
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:58,058
用来钉我的棺材更合适
the proverbial nail in my coffin,wouldn't it?

360
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,011
明天
Tomorrow.

361
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,087
什么?
Sorry?

362
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:13,043
明天早上  首先
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

363
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,003
准备好我以前说过的东西--
Get everything I mentioned before,

00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:20,056
仪器  麻醉药
the instruments,the anesthesia,

365
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:22,003
还有一个能拿镊子的人
and someone who can hold a damn clamp.

366
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,082
好
Of course.

367
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,085
我会把它取出来--你的肿瘤
I'll get it out...your tumor,

368
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,021
让你活下去
and I'll keep you alive.

369
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:37,006
但我要你保证
But I need your word.

370
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:41,022
你以前承诺我的东西都要给我
I need what you promised me before.

371
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,084
我要离开这个岛
I need to get the hell off this island.

373
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
未怀孕

374
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,008
你在忙什么?
What you working on?

375
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,050
整理一些
Just finishing

376
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,045
从坦帕市逃脱的犯人的资料
some I.R.S on that fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

377
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,084
这就是警察的工作--做不完的文件
That's what being a cop is...just endless paperwork.

378
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,052
谢谢你  甜心
Thank you, sweetie.

379
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:12,023
其实我也是一个逃犯
What if I told you I was a fugitive?

380
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,019
其实我也在逃
What if I told you I was on the run

381
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:18,083
我把我的父亲炸死了
for blowing up my father,

382
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,097
你知道这些只是时间问题
and it was only a matter of time before you found out?

383
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:24,000
这不好笑
This isn't funny.

384
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,090
我没有开玩笑
It's not a joke.

385
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,053
我差点就怀孕了
I almost had a baby, Kev.

386

我  差点有宝宝
Me. A baby.

00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,028
我不能再继续了
I can't do this.

388
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,001
玉米面豆卷?  我不会做玉米面豆卷
Taco night?I don't do taco night!

389
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:41,044
冷静Monica  我的名字不是Monica

392
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,095
等一下  别走
Wait. Hang on.

393
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,086
Kev...
Kev...

394
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,092
-我有点不对劲 -我给你下药了
-Something's wrong with me.-I drugged you.

395
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,069
你做了什么?
You what?

396
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:11,078
我必须这样  不然他们就会认为你知道我是逃犯
I had to.Otherwise, they would think you knew.

397
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:13,050
而且会问你很多问题
People are gonna be asking a lot of questions,

398
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,006
我不想你失去工作  Kev

399
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:59,014
这会是个很谨慎的过程
This is gonna be a very tricky procedure.

400
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:00,022
如果我叫你做什么

我要你马上就做  不要问问题
I need you to do it then and there,no questions asked.

402
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,020
明白了吗?
Is that understood?

00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,082
你可能难以相信
You may find this hard to believe,

404
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:10,015
但我很擅长遵守命令
but I've always been very good at just following orders.

405
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:13,062
这个回答代表"是"吗?
Is that a yes?

406
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,014
是
Yes.

407
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,023

你会紧张吗...
Do you get nervous...

410

以前会  现在不了
I used to,but not anymore, no.

不管发生了什么
Whatever happens,

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,065
局势都会大变  不是吗?
everything will be very different,won't it?

414
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,070
毫无疑问
No doubt about it.
