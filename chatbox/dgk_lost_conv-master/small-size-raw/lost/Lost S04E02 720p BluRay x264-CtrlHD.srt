你不是说房子在南边吗

以为你在说飞机的客舱

为什么我们要浪费时间去个破屋

因为我们必须去

对  就好象你必须扔一把刀

没有  但这是个巨大的岛

136
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,087
货船可能会从另外一边靠岸

ben经常这样做
That's what ben does.

143
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,060

00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,073
真的是想害我们
Intend to do us harm.

151
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,027
我不是负责装备...
I'm not in charge of, uh, packing, so...

152
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,043
你没事吧?

daniel  为什么你们带枪了
Hey, daniel, why did you bring the gun?

155
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:17,003
只是防身之用
Yeah... as a precaution.

156
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,080
防什么?
Precaution against what?

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,050
解救你和你的人...
Rescuing you and your people...

158
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:36,013
不能说是首要任务
Can't really say its our primary objective.

159
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:40,033
那什么是?
then what is?

160
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,097

你说你看到了walt是什么意思
What the hell do you mean you saw walt?

163
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,015
梦里吗
 in a dream?

164
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:58,040
不是在梦里  的的确确是walt  只是...
No dream. it was walt. only...

165
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,093
要高一点
taller.

166
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:03,023
高一点?  像个巨人吗?
Taller? what, like a giant?

167
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,080
好吧  那walt到底跟你说了什么
Okay, what exactly did walt tell you?

168
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,040
他说我有工作得完成
He said I had work to do,

169
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,028
那就是得阻止这个女人naomi
That I had to stop this woman, naomi,

170
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,022
把她的其他人带到这里
from bringing the rest of her people here

171
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:16,030
你没问为什么吗
what, you didn't ask any follow-up questions?

172
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,043
Ben给了我一枪然后把我留那等死  
Ben had shot me and left me for dead.

173
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,090
Walt救了我,所以我照着他的话去做
walt saved my life, So I pretty much took him at his word.

他给了你一枪  你却好好
He shot you, yet here you are,

175
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,074
在森林里活蹦乱跳
Fit as a fiddle, trompin' through the jungle.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,014
子弹从一边打进去从另一边出来
The bullet went in one side, came out the other.

177
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:45,017
如果我这里还是肾的话我早死了
I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there.

178
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,094
还有其他的要问吗

179
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,030

在楼上  过道最里面

You told me $100 on the phone. that was before my buddy at the police station

都不要上楼来
don't come up.

206
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,071
你呆在这里对你祖母
You're not doing your grandmother any good

207
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:37,021
一点好处也没有
Staying here, man.

208
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,027
你带给她了很多的痛苦
You're causing her a lot of pain.

我想下楼并告诉她你已经离开了
I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone.

但是现在要我这样做的唯一条件

212
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:55,047
就是你告诉我它在哪里

213
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:01,017
那么它在哪里?
so where is it?

00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,097
你可以走了

215

Miles  miles

你干嘛啊?  你要做什么?
What are you doing? what are you doing?

225
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:26,027
-他们是好人  -那为什么Naomi发送那个代码?
These are good people. they why'd naomi use the damn code?

226
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,037
是的  你还记得她说的
Yeah, you remember when she said,

227
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,087
"告诉我妹妹我爱她"?  她根本就没有妹妹
"tell my sister I love her"? well, she doesn't have a sister.

228
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,087
那是当我们在
That's what we're supposed to say

229
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:36,047
被捉住并且有枪指着我们脑袋时候才说的
If we get captured and have a gun to our heads.

230
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,051
就好像现在  Jack就应该说
Like right now jack here would say,

231
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,084
"告诉我妹妹我爱她"  明白了吗?
"tell my sister I love her." you get it?!

232
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:46,001
-我们没有杀害你的朋友  -那带我去看她的尸体
We didn't kill your friend. then take me to her body.

233
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:50,030
-Miles  那Charlotte还有Frank呢?  -带我去见Naomi!
Miles, what about charlotte? what about frank? take me to naomi!

234
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:52,024
听着  Naomi已经死了  但不是我们干的
Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us.

235
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,094
是...  是个叫John Locke的男人干的
It was--it was a man by the name of john locke.

236
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,009
他现在已经不跟我们在一起了 
He's not with us anymore.

237
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,004
Kate  认真点  如果要我再问一次的话...
kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again--

238
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,037
听着  就算我带你去看她的尸体
Look, even if I took you to her body,

239
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,000
-你还是不会知道发生了什么的  -我会知道的!
You wouldn't know what happened. I'll know!

240
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,033
现在带我过去
Now take me to her body.

241
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,083

闭上你的嘴  Mr.Linus
Keep your mouth shut, mr. linus.

245
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:35,054
Karl  如果你要跟我女儿睡的话
Karl. now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter,

246
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:38,007
你还是叫我Ben比较好
I insist you call me ben.

247
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,027
放松点孩子  这个人就是想要激怒你
Easy kid. guy's just trying to get in your head.

248
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,090
去走走或干点别的吧

249
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:53,057
你介意我问你个问题吗?  James

250
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,094
是的  我介意
yeah, i do.

251
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:57,097
你为什么会离开Kate?
Why'd you leave kate behind?

252
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,047
别多费口舌了  Yoda
You're wasting your time, yoda.

253
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,074
我知道这不太令人愉快  但是让我们面对它吧
I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it.

254
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,090
你现在真的没有机会了
You really don't stand a chance now.

255
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,080
什么机会?
chance at what?

256
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:14,015
James  看看你自己
James, look at yourself.

257
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,014
是的  在这个岛上
Yes, on this island,

258
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,014
你很勇敢大胆而且帅气
You're brave, daring, handsome.

259
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:18,047
你是个人物
you're someone.

260
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,004
但如果你带他们离开...
But if you left with them...

261
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:24,090
回到现实社会  你这样生活在社会底层的小混混
Back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you

262
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:28,094
根本竞争不过一流外科医生的
Could never compete with a first-class surgeon.

263
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,097
我觉得当你选择
I think kate was really upset

264
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,050
跟我们一起走  Kate很伤心
When you made your choice to come with us.

265
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,047
多亏了她还有Jack在身边抚慰她
Thank god she has jack there to comfort her--

266
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,014
james! 
james!

267
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:46,007
-不要  -不要干嘛?
Don't. don't what?!

268
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,056
-谁可以告诉我为什么要让这个人活着?
Anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?!

269
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,046
我们让他活着
we're keeping him alive

270
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,030
是因为他在这个岛上比我们任何人时间都长
Because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us,

271
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,070
因为他有我们想要的信息
Because he has information we need,

272
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,054
还有除了他的嘴巴
And because apart from his mouth,

273
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,064
他完全不会有危险
He's completely harmless.

274
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:00,011
他的嘴巴刺痛了你的心吗?
His mouth put that hole in your gut?

275
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:04,094
我们解决他吧  就这这里  就现在
Let's--let's execute him right here, right now,

276
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,014
在他女儿面前
In front of his daughter.

277
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:29,041
他对我们耍诡计只是时间问题  Johnny
It's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny.

278
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:31,091
我打赌他已经想好了
And I'll bet he's already figured out

279
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:33,094
下一步怎么对付我们
How he's gonna do it.

280
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,087
所以  你来牵着他吧
So you walk him.

281
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,054
他在干嘛?
What is he doing?

282
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:09,067
这光线...
the light...

283
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:12,007
有些奇怪  不是吗?
Is strange out here, isn't it?

284
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:14,061
看起来...  看起来好像不是
It's... it's kind of like it doesn't--

285
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,061
分散的不太舒服
It doesn't scatter quite right.  dan? dan?

286
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,017
Dan?
Dan?

287
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,064
你叫Dan  对吗?
Your name's dan, right?

288
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,071
听着  Dan
listen, dan,

289
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:31,047
我知道你不想任何人受到伤害  对吗?
I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right?

290
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:34,054
那你为什么不把那东西放在一边呢?
So why don't you just put that away?

291
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:41,027
因为  Miles...  会杀了我
Because, um, miles... would kill me?

292
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,007
但我们只是想帮帮忙
But we're just trying to help--

293
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,083
Kate  你在浪费时间
Kate, you're wasting your breath.

294
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,069
我们只需静观其变  然后看看会发生什么  好吗?
Let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay?

295
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,003
他们没有杀她
They didn't kill her.

296
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,006
他们说的是事实
It happened like they said it did.

297
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,029
是Charlotte
it's charlotte.

298
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:04,056
她就在离这里三公里的地方  好吧  我们去找她
She's only 3 kilometers from here. all right, then. let's go get her.

299
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,016
我说了  我们一起走

因为我的朋友们现在就躲在丛林里

把枪对着你还有他的头

在你认为这是真实的之前

你读过几个语言的版本了

这是北极熊

00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:07,006
等等  "ursus"就是熊的意思?
Wait, "ursus" as in bear?

321
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,009
是北极熊的意思

322
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:17,059
Charlotte  我们在沙漠里  这是个骗局  不是吗?

我们在担心你什么时候回来

00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:11,042
于是我们回到座舱然后从哪里开始追踪你
