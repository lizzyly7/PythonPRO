上个礼拜在这地方外蹲点的男人

不是只有我们离开了这个岛
We're not the only ones who left the island.

他有没有告诉你我离岛了
Did he tell you that I was off the island?

11
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:35,056
是的  他说了  他说我必须回去
Yes, he did. he said that I had to come back.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:38,056
我们也要把他带走的
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,066

00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,086
第二号录像片
The arrow.

25
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:32,063
鉴于你对这个具体领域的专业知识
Given your specific area of expertise

26
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,083
对于建立这个站的目的
You should find it no surprise

27
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,070
你应该不会感到惊讶
That this station's primary purpose

28
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,083
这个站是为了研发自卫策略
Is to develop defensive strategies

29
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,046
以及收集情报的
And gather intelligence

30
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:42,066
主要是针对岛上的敌对土著
On the island's hostile indigenous population--

31
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,026
张博士
Dr chang!

32
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:46,010
-张博士  -你干嘛
- Dr. chang?  - damn it! what the hell?!

33
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,083
-停  -先生  兰花站出了点事
- Cut!  - sir, we got a problem down at the orchid.

34
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,000
在那边
Over here.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
我们正以你要求的规格削减岩石
We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,006
那时钻头融化了
That's when the drill melted.

37
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,003
-钻头融化了  -是的是的
- The drill melted?  - yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,000
还有3米就到原计划的界限了
3 meters from the margin line on the plans.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,086
我们用了6个碳钻头
We went through six carbon drill bits,

40
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,046
最后一个直接就被烤烂了
And the last one just fried.then my operator

41
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,073
然后我的工程师就开始发疯了
My operator Starts grabbing his head and freaking out.

42
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,013
我们给墙拍了声纳图像
We sonar-imaged the wall.

43
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:38,023
墙里大概有一个20米的空心处
There's an open chamber about 20 meters in,

44
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,083
就在岩石后面
Behind the rock.

45
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,070
有什么东西
There's something in there.

46
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,040
唯一进去的办法
And the only way to get to it

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,056
是在这里和这里放炸药
Is to lay charges here and here

48
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,038
炸开...
And blast through it and take a look

49
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,023
绝对不允许
under no circumstances.

50
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,013
这个站建在这里的原因就是
This station is being built here because of its proximity

51
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,066
它距离我们确信的无穷的能源相当接近
To what we believe to be an almost limitless energy.

52
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:01,013
那种能源  如果我们正确使用
And that energy, once we can harness it correctly?

53
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:04,086
我们甚至可以扭曲时间
It's going to allow us to manipulate time.

54
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:06,093
是
Right.

55
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:10,036
好吧  那又怎样  我们可以回去杀了希特勒了
Okay, sohat? we're gonna go back and kill hitler?

56
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,003
别傻了
Don't be absurd.

57
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,096
这都是有规则的
There are rules,

58
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:16,046
不能破坏的规则
Rules that can't be broken.

59
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,053
那你想让我做什么
So what do you want me to do?

60
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,016
你什么都别做
You're gonna do nothing.

61
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:25,030
如果你再继续挖掘哪怕就一厘米
If you drill even 1 centimeter further,

62
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,060
那能源都可能被释放
You risk releasing that energy.

63
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,083
那是你希望发生的么
Is that you want to happen?

64
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:35,043
上帝保佑我们
God help us all.

65
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,043
好吧  把他弄上去  我们走
All right, get him up. let's go.

66
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,086
看着点路
Watch yourself!

67
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:46,063
对不起  先生  不会再这样了
Sorry, sir. it won't happen again.

68
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,053
好吧  我来...
All right. I'll grab the rest of his stuff.

69
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,000
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

70
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,070
时空旅行  那家伙以为我们有多蠢
Time travel.how stupid does that guy think we are?

71
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,086
我们走  伙计们
Let's go, guys.

为什么你不把这盖上  Jack
Why don't you close that up now, jack?

81
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:02,023
来,我们把他带回车里  该走了
Come on. Let's get him in the van. it's out back.

82
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,050
我们要把它带到哪去
Where are we taking him?

83
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,016
一旦我们接上Hugo  再考虑这个
We'll worry about that once we pick up hugo.

84
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,080
Hurley...
Hurley...

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,003
他被关在一个精神病院里
Is locked away in a mental institution.

86
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,000
招募他比
Which should make recruiting him

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,036
你其他朋友都简单了
Considerably easier than the rest of your friends.

88
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,000
他们已经不是我朋友了
They're not my friends anymore.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,076
就是这种精神
Oh, that's the spirit.

90
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,033
我们怎么到这来的
How did we get here?

91
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,086
这些都是怎么发生的
How did all this happen?

92
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:35,099
因为你们离开了  Jack
It happened because you left, jack.

93
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:42,093
我们开始吧  好么
Now let's get started, shall we?

94
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:56,059
那么接上Hurley之后...然后呢
So once we get hurley... then what?

95
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,026
然后我们去接Sun Sayid...
Then we get sun, sayid...

96
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,093
当然还有Kate
And Kate, of course.

97
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:04,099
我不觉得这样可行
I don't see that happening.

98
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,046
你最后一次见他是什么时候
When was the last time you saw him?

99
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:17,013
我是说Locke
I mean, Locke.

100
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:21,043
在岛上
On the island...

101
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:27,066
在兰花站的温室下面
In the orchid station below the greenhouse.

102
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:32,020
我向他道歉,是我把他的生活弄得一团糟
I told him I was sorry For making his life so miserable,

103
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,013
然后他就走了
And then he left.

104
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:42,030
显然John的来访对你影响很大
So obviously John's visit to you made an impression.

105
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,083
他说了些什么让你对他坚信不疑
What did he say to make you such a believer?

106
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,020
Sawyer  Juliet
Sawyer,Juliet,

107
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:55,083
船上的每个人  我们丢下的每个人
Everyone from the boat... and everyone we left behind--

108
00:07:55,083 --> 00:08:00,070
John说要不是我回来  他们都会死
John said that they'd die, too, if I didn't come back.

109
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:06,013
他有没有告诉你岛移动之后那些人怎么了
Did he tell you what happened to them after the island moved?

110
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:10,003
没
No.

111
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,096
没  他没说
No, he didn't.

112
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,093
那我们永远不会知道了
Then I guess we'll never know.

113
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:21,093
三年前...

114
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,096

有人吗
Anyone?

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,093
出什么事了
What happened?

119
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:45,040
那道光是什么
What was that light?

120
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:49,046
我们一定在辐射范围内
We must've been inside the radius.

121
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,030
那道光到底是什么
What the hell was that?

122
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,050
我不知道
I don't know.

123
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,073
货轮怎么消失了
Where's the freighter?

124
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,050
-可能是沉了  -不可能
-Maybe it went down. -Unh-unh. No way.

125
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,036
刚刚那船还在冒黑烟
A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke.

126
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,053
现在就消失了
Now there's just nothin'?

127
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:22,023
那驾直升机呢
What about the helicopter?

128
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,093
刚才正在追那货轮
It was heading for that boat.

129
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,033

130
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,023
Rose
Rose!

131
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,043
-Bernard  -Rose
-Bernard! -Rose!

132
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:39,019
-看见Rose了吗  -没有
-Have you seen rose?! -No.

133
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,066
哦  天哪

00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,066
-Bernard  -Rose
-Bernard! -Rose!

135
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,083
-你刚去哪了  -我刚在教堂那边
-Where were you? -I was over... by the church.

136

-那...那声响是怎么回事  还有那道光  -我不知道
-What was that sound?What was that light? -I don't know.

137
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,029
冷静点  不用发慌  好吗
Just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right?

138
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,048
-我们先回营地然后..
-We'll just go back to camp and...

-冷静,不用慌,我们不能回去了
-Calm down no need to panic?We can't go back to the camp.

140
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:00,030
-你说什么  -营地没了
-What the hell are you talking about?-There is no camp.

141
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:07,070
天空一道亮光  然后就成了这样
The--the sky lit up, a-and then this.

142
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,000
厨房  消失了
The--the kitchen?Gone.

143
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:17,010
然后那些帐篷  所有的水和食物  都消失了
And--and all the tents, all the food and water... gone.

144
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,099
除了我们剩下的都消失了  所有的东西
Well, everything but us. All of it.

145
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,040
都消失了
It's gone.

146
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,076
不是消失了
It's not gone.

147
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,066

I thought you were on the freighter.

150
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:33,086
没  我们没能成功
No, we never made it.

151
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,067
刚才闪光的时候我们正在离开货轮
We were on our way out there when it happened.

152
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,013
你什么意思  营地不是消失了
What do you mean, the camp's not gone?

153

-你他妈的又是谁  -他是Dan

-He's our physicist.-Listen, we have no time.

155
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,033
我想让你带我去个人造的

人工修建的地标建筑

我觉得嘟嘟知道的更多

00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:38,061
他要钻进隧道  永不回头

你为什么从直升机上跳下来

和你说过  我们没油了

你不知道,要解释起来有多难

这现象对于量子物理学家,都很难说清

215
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,067
一张旋转着的唱片
Like a record spinning on a turntable...

时间

222
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,041
所以我们的营地没了
So that's why our camp is gone?

223
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,094
是因为这岛在穿越时光
Because the island is moving through time?

224
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,047
是的  可能是小岛  也可能是我们

什么

但是Ben Linus派我来做你的领导
But ben linus appointed me as your leader.

248
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,041
这是我听过最荒唐的事
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

249
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:18,091
永别了  John Locke

够吓人的了
Fair enough.

从你担心你的航班开始

叫Hugo reyes  于傍晚早些时候逃出

他正是大洋六人组之一

至于为何他会谋杀一个造访者

00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:33,057
你断定他是来杀我的吗
Do you think he was gonna kill me?

308
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:36,004
在Bentham死后  我不会再冒任何风险
I'm not taking any risks. after bentham died--

309
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:38,054
-你说的是locke吗  -嗯  就是locke
-You mean locke. -Yes, I mean locke.

310
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:42,014
我也需要一个那么酷的代号
I need a cool code name.

311
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,061
什么时候变得这么敏感了
So when'd you become so paranoid?

312
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:51,061
如果你这两年
If you'd spent the last two years

313
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:53,057
经历过我所经历的
Doing the things I was doing,

314
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:55,067
你也会和我一样敏感
You'd be paranoid, too.

315
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:57,000
是吗
Oh, yeah?

316
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,047
对什么敏感
Paranoid? like what?

317
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:01,031
什么样的经历
What kind of things?

318
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:04,027
我曾为Benjamin Linus做事
I was working for benjamin linus.

319
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:07,054
等等  他现在是我们一伙的吗
Wait. he's on our side now?

320
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:11,004
听我说  Hurley
Listen to me, hurley.

321
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:14,034
如果你不幸遇见他
If you ever have the misfortune of running into him,

322
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:18,034
无论他说什么  反着去做就行了
Whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.

323
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:29,064
等在这里
Wait here.

324
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:25,000
-他还好吗  -不知道
-Is he all right? -I don't know.

325
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,077
还有呼吸么
Is he breathing or what? who is that? check him out.

326
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:33,097
小心  那家伙有枪  快跑  报警
Look out! that guy's got a gun! run! get out of here! call the cops!

327
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:36,064
Hurry
Hurry!

328
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:45,024
Sayid
Sayid!

329
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,044
还好吗
You okay?

330
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:50,057
把我弄上车
Get me to the car.

331
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:53,007
老兄
Dude. dude.

332
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:54,057
啊  天呐
Oh, man.

333
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:57,007
我想这里应该是安全的
I thought it was supposed to be a safe house.

334
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,024
看来不应该离开岛上
I never should've left the island.

335
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,077
嘿  你觉得他在找我们吗
Hey, do you think he's looking for us?

336
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:21,093
你说谁
Who?

337
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,070
Widmore
Widmore.

338
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,000
他花了20年才发现这个地方
It took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time.

339
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,097
我要集中精神了
I'll start holding my breath now.

340
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:32,007
来这里
Over here!

341
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,007
-这就是那个舱吗  -以前是
-Is this the hatch? -it was.

342
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:50,030
爆炸了  跟我们离开时一样
Blown up, just like we left it.

343
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,020
好吧
Okay.

344
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,030
那么现在的时间是...
So when we are now...

345
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,050
在你们坠机后
It's now after you and your people crashed on the island.

346
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,047
-我们的帐篷又回到海滩了吗  -有可能
-You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again? -it's possible, yeah.

347
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,037
-好  我要回去  -嘿  别
-Good. I'm going back. -hey. no, no.

348
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:08,053
-没意思  -盯着这个洞更没意思
-It's pointless. -more pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?

349
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,047
谁知道下一次闪光会是什么时候
We don't know when the next flash is coming.

350
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,058
当你回到海滩的时候,帐篷可能会又消失了  
By the time you get back to the beach, The camp could be gone again. yeah,

351
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,053
-要是没有消失呢
-but what if it ain't?

352
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:17,057
要是现在直升机还没起飞呢
Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?

353
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,094
我们可以警告他们
We could warn them

354
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:22,040
阻止他们飞向那条船上
Stop them from ever flying to that boat.

355
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,030
不是这么回事
That's not the way it works.

356
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,050
谁说的
Who says?

357
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,030
你什么都不能改变  不能
You cannot change anything. you can't.

358
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,074
无论你做什么都是徒劳无功
Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work,

359
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:33,070
为什么
Why not?

360
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,087
时间就好比一条街道
Time--it's like a street, all right?

361
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:39,080
在街道上我们可以向前走  可以掉头向后走
We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse,

362
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,034
但是我们永远不能制造出一条新的街道
But we cannot ever create a new street.

363
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:45,034
如果试图改变这些
If we try to do anything different,

364
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,034
无论怎样都会失败
We will fail every time.

365
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:50,073
无论发生了什么
Whatever happened, happened.

366
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:57,040
你怎么知道这么多  小子
How do you know so much about this, danny boy?

367
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:04,067
我知道这些是因为
I know about this because...

368
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:07,080
我花费了毕生精力学习空间学
I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time.

369
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,077
我知道这些是因为
I know all this because

370
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:12,017
这本日记包含了我学习
This journal contains everything I've ever learned

371
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,014
所有关于达摩组织的内容
About the dharma initiative.

372
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:17,010
这就是我在这的原因
This is why I'm here.

373
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,047
我知道发生了什么
I know what's happening.

374
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:22,074
那我们怎么才能让它停下来
So how can we stop it?

375
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,057
我们不能让它停下来
We can't stop it.

376
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:28,067
那谁能
Then who can?

377
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,080
Richard
Richard?

378
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,033
John
john

379
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,040
Richard...
Richard...

380
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,007
发生什么事了
What is happening?

381
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:41,067
你会失血至死的
What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.

382
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,017
在这
Here.

383
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:49,027
我要把子弹取出来
I need to get the bullet out.

384
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:55,050
你怎么知道我的腿中弹了  Richard
How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, richard?

385
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,094
你告诉我的  John
Because you told me there was, john.

386
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:59,034
不  我没有
No, no. no, I didn't.

387
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,057
你会的
Well... you will.

388
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:06,050
是Ethan开枪打的我
It was ethan who shot me.

389
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,030
善有善报  恶有恶报
What comes around, goes around.

390
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:15,080
我在什么时间
When am i?

391
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,034
John  时间是相对的
Well, john, that--that's all relative.

392
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,020
慢点  慢点
Wait, wait.

393
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,070
噪声  天空光芒四射的时候  你在哪
The--the noise, when the sky lit up... where did you go?

394
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,024
我哪都没去  John  是你离开了
I didn't go anywhere, john. you went.

395
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:31,020
好的  这里受伤了
All right, this--this is gonna hurt.

396
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,004
如果你继续动伤口会恶化  别动
It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? hold still.

397
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,094
好了
Uhh! all done.

398
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,097
老天
Jeez.

399
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,000
我不明白
I don't understand.

400
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,057
你怎么知道我在这的
How--how did you know that I was here?

401
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,020
你怎么知道在哪能找到我  我想解释  John
How did you know where to find me? I wish I had time to explain it, john.

402
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,053
但是你马上要移动了
But you're gonna be moving on soon,

403
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:02,070
这之前我要重申两件事  "移动"
And we need to go over a couple of things before you do. "moving on"? aah!

404
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,007
对不起  第一件事
Sorry. the first thing, okay?

405
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:07,017
你要清理伤口,每两小时一次
You're gonna need to clean out the wound Every couple of hours

406
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,037
体重尽量放在另一条腿上
And keep as much weight off the g as you can, all right?

407
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,050
小岛会处理其他的事  但是我没
The island'll do the rest, john, all right? but I don't--

408
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,090
第二  不不  集中精神
Second thing-- no, no, pay attention.

409
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,024
下次我们在见面时  我就不认识你了
Next time we see each other, I'm not gonna recognize you.

410
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:18,076
-明白吗  你把这个给我  
All right? you give me this. all right?

411
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,067
这是什么
What is this?

412
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,053
-指南针  -干什么用
It's a compass. what does it do?

413
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:26,080
指向南方  John
It points north, john.

414
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,077
我希望有更多时间解释这些
Look, I wish I had time to be more sensitive about this

415
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,077
但是要接受的事  实在太多了
Because it's a lot to swallow,

416
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:34,085
你必须知道这些才能完成你的使命,
But you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do.

417
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:36,038
继续刚才说的
 So I'm just gonna say it, okay?

418
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,027
救这座岛唯一的办法
The only way to save the island

419
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:42,024
-就是把你们中离开的人带回这里  -Jack  Kate
Is to get your people back here--the ones who left. jack, kate...

420
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:44,024
直升机撞到了船  那条船
The chopper was headed for the boat. the boat--

421
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,074
不  他们没事  他们已经回家了
No, they're fine, john, and they're already home,

422
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:49,010
所以你必须说服他们回来
So you have to convince them to come back.

423
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,074
我该怎么做
How--how am I supposed to do that?

424
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,004
你会死  John
You're gonna have to die, john.

425
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:05,023
那么  你们把它炸了之前那是什么
So... what was this thing before you guys blew it up?

426
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,084
-达摩站  -干什么的
A dharma station. for what?

427
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,097
有一个叫Desmond的人住在里面
There was a man named desmond living down in it.

428
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:13,040
每108分钟他就会按一次按钮
He was pushing a button every 108 minutes

429
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,003
拯救世界
To save the world.

430
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:17,007
真的
Really?

431
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,050
是的  真的
Yeah. really.

432
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,027
妈...
Son of a...

433
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:34,073
...的
Bitch.

434
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:57,037
这个舱  它回来了
The hatch--it's back.

435
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,060
我猜你还没找到它
I guess you haven't found it yet.

436
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,060
你去哪
Hey! where you goin'?

437
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,030
后门  我去找点生活用品
Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.

438
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:23,087
James  等等  这不是好主意
James, wait. not a good idea.

439
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,087
天空能在一瞬间变成它想成为的东西
The sky can flash all it wants,

440
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:27,084
但我可不想重新开始Dilbert
But I ain't startin' over, dilbert.

441
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,067
我不要钻木取火
I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and making a fire,

442
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,017
我不要狩猎野猪
And I ain't huntin' damn boar!

443
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,080
那有食物  啤酒和衣服
There's dharma food, beer and clothing in there.

444
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,080
不管怎样  我都要让Desmond让我进去
And I'm gettin' desmond to let me in one way or another.

445
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,073
不会成功的  朋友
That's not gonna work, my friend.

446
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,073
-为什么  -因为他刚出来的时候
-why not?  -because desmond didn't know you

447
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:43,030
还不认识你
When he first came out of there.

448
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,023
那意味着你没有遇到  也意味着你不能遇到
That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.

449
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:49,027
如果我听你的话  那非常有吸引力
Th would all be fascinating if I was listening to ya.

450
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,077
你怎么知道Desmond在那里呢
So how you do know desmond is even in there?

451
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,073
里面可能是任何人
Think about it. it could be anybody.

452
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:54,077
我不在乎谁在那里
I don't care who's in there.

453
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,080
等会
Wait.

454
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,094
-等会  -打开这该死的门
-Wait. -open the damn door!

455
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:00,094
-不管用了  -会管用的
