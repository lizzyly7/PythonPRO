因为那个"世界末日"按钮?

00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,089
不要宠坏自己了  对吗?
Wouldn't wanna spoil ourselves, now, would we?

155
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,098
嗯  "宠坏"
Yeah, "spoil".

156
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,015
你们知道Michael和Walt
Do you know where Michael and Walt

157
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:53,095
把他们没带上船的东西放在哪吗?
left the stuff that they didn't take with them on the raft?

158
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:57,000
-什么东西?     -衣物
-What kind of stuff?     -Their clothes?

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,013
我想还在沙滩上
I think their stuff's still on the beach

160
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:00,088
在他们帐篷的后面
back where their tent is.

161
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:04,012
谢谢
Thanks.

162
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,032
真可怜
Poor thing.

163
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:13,052
在岛上失去心爱的人 那滋味真不好受
Can't be easy, losing the one person you love on the island.

164
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,019
来  闻一下  这是他的  对吗?
Here, smell this. That's his, right?

165
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,001
来  好好闻一下
Come on, get a good whiff.

166
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,091
你总是独自跑掉去找他?
You're always trying to run off and find him

167
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:40,029
那就去找他  找Walt
then find him. Find Walt.

168
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:46,032
好狗  找Walt
Good dog. Find Walt!

169
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,018
我知道我叫醒了你  对不起  真对不起
I know I woke you and I'm so very, very sorry,

170
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,009
但怎么8个钟头了  还没睡着呢?
but, please, staying awake for eight hours straight?

171
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,084
这惩罚太残忍  太重了吧?
Isn't that cruel and unusual punishment?

172
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,079
摇篮怎么了?
How's that cradle treating you?

173
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,038
摇篮很好  问题出在孩子上
The cradle's great, it's the baby that's the problem.

174
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:30,038
-怎么了?     -他就是不睡
-What's wrong?     -He just won't sleep.

175
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,092
我来试试?
May I?

176
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:40,028
好
Sure.

177
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:46,091
婴儿喜欢被裹起来的感觉
Babies like the feeling of being constricted.

178
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:52,087
到长大了  才不想被"裹"起来
It's not until we're older that we develop the desire to be free.

179
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,020
给
There.

180
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:10,070
我想每个人都比我了解我孩子
You know, I think everybody knows more about my baby than me.

181
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,034
每个人?
Everybody?

182
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:17,021
Charlie昨晚告诫我 弄醒他会让他烦躁不安
Charlie read me the riot act last night for waking him.

183
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:22,085
看现在这情形  看来他说得对
And as mad as it made me, turns out he was right.

184
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:25,094
我们就像这孩子的母亲和父亲
It's like we're playing "Mum and Dad" to this baby

185
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:29,074
然而我却不记得我嫁过他
yet I don't remember marrying him.

186
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:32,071
我说真的  实际上我们是陌生人
Seriously. We're practically strangers.

187
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:35,048
就我所知而言 Charlie可能是某个宗教怪胎
For all I know, Charlie could be some religious freak.

188
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,006
我很怀疑那一点
I seriously doubt that.

189
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:41,087
那他为什么到处拿着一个圣母像?
Then why does he carry around a Virgin Mary statue?

190
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,029
什么?
A what?

191
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,052
一个小雕像
You know, one of the little statues?

192
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:49,009
他说在丛林里面找到的
He says he found it in the jungle.

193
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:54,054
难道是那东西?
How about that?

194
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:34,019
-亲人逝去总令人悲痛不已  不是吗?   -Boone!
-Death sucks, doesn't it?  -Boone!

195
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:43,074
我感到很难过  Shan
I'm so sorry, Shan.

196
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:48,015
你总算回来了
You came back.

197
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,056
Marky Mark海报哪里去了?
Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?

198
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:04,012
我18岁了  Boone
I'm 18, Boone.

199
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,022
你妈妈会很生气的
Your mom's gonna freak.

200
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:12,095
这是一种振作
It's a wake.

201
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:18,030
说真的  要振作  谁不喝点酒呢?
I mean, seriously, who doesn't serve booze at a wake?

202
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,032
苏格兰酒
Scotch

203
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:25,047
敬你的父亲
To your dad.

204
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:43,000
也许打这后  你来纽约找我?
Maybe after all this you'll come visit me in New York.

205
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,013
我不必去找你
I won't have to visit

206
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,099
如果我得到在Martha Graham舞蹈公司的工作
if I get that job at the Martha Graham Dance Company.

207
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,045
我会在那住
I'll be living there.

208
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:55,071
对  实习
Right. Internship.

209
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:59,017
我知道只有三千分之一的机会
I know it's, like, a one in three thousand chance, but

210
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,056
但我也许能行
I might get it.

211
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:04,087
绝对可以
Absolutely.

212
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,083
你和我妈妈谈过吗?
Have you spoken to my mother?

213
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:17,061
我们互不理睬的 独自尝着自己的苦水
She's going through her thing and I'm going through mine.

214
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:21,089
你们有相处过吗?
Have you two been getting along?

215
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:25,028
她讨厌我
She hates me.

216
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,016
试试和她聊聊
Just try to talk to her.

217
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:35,025
从他们结婚的第一天起 她就不满我和他的关系...
From day one, she resented my relationship with him.

218
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:38,023
我和爸爸的关系
With Dad.

219
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,063
我们要休息一下
We need a break.

220
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,021
五分钟
Five minutes.

221
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,099
给
Here.

222
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,021
你看什么?
What are you looking at?

223
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,047
我们要往岛内走
We have to cut inland.

224
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,086
什么? 进入丛林?
What? Into the jungle?

225
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:42,003
他们说他们的人在海边 如果我们继续走...
They said their people were on the beach. If we keep walking...

226
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:46,048
这海岸弯成一个半岛
The beach curves into a peninsula.

227
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:49,032
可能走不过去
It may not be passable.

228
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:52,062
可能走不过?
May not?

229
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,082
对
May not.

230
00:19:55,082 --> 00:20:00,014
你这么做是想把这家伙快点送回去  对吗?
You're doing this to get the cowboy back faster, aren't you?

231
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:04,037
你拿我们的生命冒险 来帮他?
You would risk our lives to help him?

232
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:08,024
这是唯一的方法
It's the only way I know.

233
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,060
我更喜欢不说话时的你
I liked you better when you weren't talking.

234
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,061
真不敢相信他还在睡
I can't believe he's still asleep.

235
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:26,088
婴儿总爱在襁褓中入睡
Swaddling works every time.

236
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:32,041
你想抱一下吗?
Hey, do you want to hold him?

237
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,015
不用了
That's OK.

238
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:39,048
伸手出来
Put your arms out.

239
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,049
没关系的
It's OK.

240
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,025
来
There.

241
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:57,024
-他气息很好  -很好闻是不是?   
-He smells good.   -He does, doesn't he?

242
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,024
那当然
Yeah.

243
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:06,076
-你好  Charlie  -你好
-Hello, Charlie.  -Hello.

244
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:11,037
John刚教我一招  用襁褓包
Hey, John just taught me a new trick. Swaddling.

245
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:14,056
这法子很好
That's excellent.

246
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:20,015
我过来照顾他 以便你可以散下步
I just came to take him so you could have your walk.

247
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:29,001
你来得正是时候 我要起程了
Well, great timing. Yeah, I got to get going.

248
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,095
抱着了
I got him.

249
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,064
谢谢你的帮忙  John
Well, thanks for your help, John.

250
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:40,045
不客气
You're welcome.

251
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,036
什么?
What?

252
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:25,038
我没事  我没事  该死
I'm fine. I'm fine, damn it.

253
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,002
别出声!
Shut up!

254
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:30,006
什么? 话都不能说?
What? They can't talk at all?

255
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,068
如果给"他们"听到 大家都没命的
If he talks he'll get us all killed.

256
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,093
什么东西?  "他们"?
By what? Them?

257
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:36,052
我想他们住在沿这路 要一天路程的那边
I thought they lived a day back that way.

258
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:41,082
你还是住口  叫你的同伴上路吧
How about you shut your mouth and get your buddy over here moving.

259
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:46,044
你们到底怎么了?
What happened to you people?

260
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:52,093
你想我们带你回去?  好
You want us to take you back with us? fine.

261
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:56,071
但如果你想让我保持安静
But you want me to keep quiet

262
00:22:57,014 --> 00:23:03,001
那你要告诉我  为什么我要这么做
Then you need to tell me why I have to.

263
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:17,047
我们来这里的第一晚 他们就来了
They came the first night that we got here.

264
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,060
他们抓走我们三个人
They took three of us.

265
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,016
然后两周之内都没什么事发生
Nothing happened for two weeks.

266
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:28,088
但两周后  他们又来  再抓走九个
Then they came back, and took nine more.

267
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,056
他们很聪明
They're smart.

268
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,061
他们是禽兽
And they're animals.

269
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:39,030
随时随地他们都可能出现
And they could be anywhere, at any time.

270
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,036
现在我们穿越丛林...
Now we're moving through the jungle...

271
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,041
这个属于他们的丛林...
their jungle...

272
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:49,002
只有这样  才救得了你这个乡下人朋友
just so that you can save your little hick friend over here.

273
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:54,087
如果你幻想一把枪一发子弹能制服他们
And if you think that one gun and one bullet is gonna stop them

274
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:58,027
那你就慢慢幻想
think again.

275
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,074
闭上你的臭嘴  继续上路
So, shut your mouth, and keep moving.

276
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:08,016
他们抢走了我儿子
They took my son.

277
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:13,090
他们抢走很多东西
They took a lot of things.

278
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:47,097
我明白你失去亲人的感受
I know what it is to lose someone you care deeply about.

279
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:59,028
你真的认为我全因Boone才这样?
You really think that this is all about Boone?

280
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:07,019
我见到Walt  Sayid
I saw Walt, Sayid.

281
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:12,066
那为什么我们会坐在Boone的坟边?
Then why are we sitting at Boone's grave?

282
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:21,092
-你回去  Sayid  -你去哪里?
-Just go back, Sayid.  -Where are you going?

283
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:25,005
在找Walt
To find him.

284
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:31,020
信来了
It came.

285
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,074
真的?
What?

286
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:37,071
-天啊  -打开看看
-Oh, my God.  -Open it.

287
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:43,018
-我不行  -什么?
-I can't open it.  -You what?

288
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,026
你来打开
You open it.

289
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:49,086
你等这信等了六周 没理由让我来打开
You've been waiting 6 months for this letter. No way I'm opening it.

290
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,095
我成了!
I got it!

291
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,080
-你成了?  -成了!
-You got it?  -I got it!

292
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,006
噢  天啊  你要到纽约去了!
Oh, my God, you're going to New York!

293
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:10,088
天啊
Oh, my God!

294
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:12,039
喂?
Hello?

295
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,012
对  我就是
Yeah, this is her.

296
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:20,035
那不可能
That's impossible.

297
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:23,064
好的  你确定?
OK, are you sure?

298
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:25,049
当然
Of course.

299
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,091
我会的
I will certainly do that.

300
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:30,097
对不起
Sorry.

301
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,003
什么?
What?

302
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:37,039
我房租卡没钱了
My rent cheque bounced.

303
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,000
但你看起来...很有钱
But you're like... rich.

304
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,029
对不起  我应该给点东西你喝的
I would have offered you a drink

305
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,088
但十分钟后我要参加一个会议
but I have a meeting in ten minutes.

306
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:53,028
我的房租卡没钱了
Yeah. My cheques are bouncing.

307
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,047
那是因为你要搬出去住
That happens when you withdraw

308
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,046
而你又不存款  Shannon
and you don't deposit. Shannon

309
00:26:57,046 --> 00:27:01,057
什么时候我可以拿到爸爸留给我的钱?
When do I get the money Dad left me?

310
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:05,054
来自遗嘱的钱
The money from the will.

311
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,023
没有什么遗嘱
There was no will.

312
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:10,057
什么?
What?

313
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:14,067
Shannon  你父亲和我有个生前信托
Shannon, your father and I had a living trust.

314
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,061
所有东西都归我
Everything passed to me.

315
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:22,029
恐怕没有东西指定给你的
I'm afraid there was nothing specifically designated for you.

316
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:24,033
他为什么要那么做?
Why would he do that?

317
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:28,041
也许他想你自力更生
Well, maybe he just wanted you to find your own way.

318
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,081
我们都要工作  Shannon
We all have to work, Shannon.

319
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,054
工作才有钱
And most of us are the better for it.

320
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:37,070
我会工作  我刚得到这个有名的实习机会
I can work. I just got this really prestigious internship

321
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,048
我暂时不会赚到钱
and I'm not gonna make any money for a while

322
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:43,034
但我将会工作...每天16个小时
but I'm gonna be working like 16 hours a day.

323
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:48,047
我知道你唯一能连续做16个小时的事 就是睡觉
The only thing I've ever seen you do 16 hours a day straight is sleep.

324
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:52,052
我只是要到纽约去
I just need to get to New York.

325
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:59,089
我只是需要点资金起步
I need just something to get started.

326
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,041
我会还你的
I'll pay you back.

327
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,098
这周是实习
This week it's an internship.

328
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:09,006
去年是什么来着 内景设计?
Last year it was, what... interior design?

329
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:12,022
你永远还不了钱给我
You'll never pay me back.

330
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:16,080
那样你只会更憎恨自己
And you'll only hate yourself even more.

331
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,083
我真的很需要钱  Sabrina
I really want this, Sabrina.

332
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,096
我会做得很出色的
I can do this.

333
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:28,013
对不起  Shannon
I'm sorry, Shannon.

334
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:34,005
你自己看着办吧
You're on your own.

335
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:49,098
双六  你真厉害
Double sixes, how nice for you.

336
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:52,094
运气
Lucky.

337
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:01,039
希望你不要想歪了
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea

338
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,043
看到我抱着孩子
about seeing me with the baby.

339
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,094
什么想歪了?
What wrong idea would that be?

340
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:10,006
你和Claire感情很好
You and Claire are close

341
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,072
你花很多时间来陪Aaron
and you spend a lot of time with Aaron.

342
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:16,078
我只是不想我越过我的底线
I just wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.

343
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:19,089
她有没有告诉你我们发生口角?
Did she tell you we had a fight?

344
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:23,099
她认为这不是口角
She didn't say it was a fight.

345
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,046
她打算忘了这件事
She was gonna give it up, you know...

346
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:31,099
为了孩子
for adoption.

347
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,058
她告诉你了吗?
She told you that?

348
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:38,011
在我做摇篮的时候她告诉了我
Yeah. When I built the cradle.

349
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,083
那也是
Oh, of course.

350
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:44,020
在你做摇篮时
Yeah. When you built the cradle.

351
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,092
-为什么问这个?    -她...
-Why do you ask?    -She...

352
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:51,061
做为妈妈  她还有很多东西要学
She's got a bit to learn... about being a mum.

353
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:54,035
责任  还有很多很多
Responsibility and all.

354
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:58,070
嗯  有件有趣的事情要说说
Now, that's an interesting thing to say

355
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,036
海洛因瘾君子
for a heroin addict.

356
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:05,037
正在戒毒的瘾君子
Recovering addict.

357
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:09,007
正在戒毒
Recovering.

358
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:16,017
该你掷了
It's your turn.

359
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:41,079
来  我来帮你
Here, let me help you.

360
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,060
我来
I got it.

361
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,011
我说我来  伙计 休息一下
I said I got him, man. Take a break.

362
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,012
听着...
Listen...

363
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:53,005
什么? 你突然关心起我来了?
What? You suddenly give a damn about me?

364
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,011
你们两个都不要理我
Just leave me alone. Both of you.

365
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:01,028
我行
I got it.

366
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:08,062
来
Come here

367
00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:11,044
来
Come on.

368
00:31:11,044 --> 00:31:17,049
嘿  Sawyer  没事吧?
Hey, Sawyer. Hey, you OK?

369
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,099
我丢下你不理...
I would have left you behind.

370
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:23,040
住口  伙计  不要试图...
Shut up, man. Don't try to...

371
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,026
我确实曾抛下你不理
I did leave you behind.

372
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:32,028
好在我不是你
Yeah, well, good thing I aren't you.

373
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:44,026
不要  Sawyer!
No, Sawyer.

374
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:48,029
Sawyer!

375
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:52,002
水! 水!
Water! Water!

376
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,046
Sawyer!

377
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,069
Sawyer! 醒醒  老友
Sawyer! Sawyer. Come on, man.

378
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:58,070
给
Here you go.

379
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,015
快
Here.

380
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:04,011
Sawyer

381
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,097
他到底怎么了?
What's the matter with him?

382
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,091
他发烧了 伤口感染  身体脱水
The fever. He's got an infection, dehydrated.

383
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,013
我们得继续前进

384
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:16,091
-什么?     -得继续前进
-What?     -We gotta keep going.

385
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:19,095
你想原地不动  好 但我们要动身了
You wanna stay? That's fine, but we're rolling out.

386
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,085
我们不能丢下他不理  Ana
We can't just leave him, Ana.

387
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:25,014
也许如果我们再休息一会 他会恢复意识
Maybe if we rest a while, he'll regain consciousness.

388
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,097
休息? 在这?
Rest? Here?

389
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:33,027
你还记得我们所发生的事 他们怎样对我们吗?
Do you remember what happened to us? What they did to us?

390
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:36,069
你还记得Goodwin吗?
Do you remember Goodwin?

391
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:42,048
Ana说得对  也许我们要上路了
Ana's right, maybe we should just push on.

392
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:45,015
我不知道什么Goodwin
I don't remember Goodwin,

393
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:50,017
对他的事我感到很抱歉 但我可不管
and I'm really sorry about whatever happened to him, but I don't care.

394
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:53,004
Eko先生?
Mr Eko,

395
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,069
能帮我做个担架吗?
can you help me make a stretcher?

396
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:07,031
Bernard  我需要4根木棒 5英尺长  结实的那种
Bernard, I need four sticks... sturdy ones, about five feet long.

397
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,050
好  知道了
Got it.

398
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,006
你打算抬你朋友走?
You're gonna carry your friend.

399
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:14,090
对  我们打算抬他
Yeah. We're gonna carry him.

400
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:20,085
为什么你这么做  Shannon?
Why are you doing this, Shannon?

401
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,093
我没叫你跟我来
I didn't ask you to follow me.

402
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:25,057
你这样子出来  很容易迷路和受伤的
You'd rather be alone and get lost or hurt.

403
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:27,019
我不需要你的帮忙  Sayid
I don't need your help, Sayid!

404
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,042
Walt不在这里
Walt is not out here!

405
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,075
你跟着的是条拉布拉多狗 不是警犬
You are following a Labrador not police dog.

406
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,027
找在海洋中一只木筏上的小孩
to find a boy who is on a raft...

407
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:38,080
-他不在木筏上     -你说什么?
-He's not on the raft.    -What are you talking about?

408
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,081
我们在沙滩上找到那瓶子
We found the bottle on the beach.

409
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:47,088
那个他们带在筏上的装有纸条的瓶子?
The bottle with the messages that they brought with them?

410
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:51,076
我知道他在这里某个地方
I know he's out here somewhere.

411
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:54,067
我见到Walt!
I saw Walt.

412
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:59,098
木筏没有了  他孤身一人
And the raft is gone and he is all alone.

413
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,090
Shannon...

414
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:12,029
用力
Come on!

415
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,093
Cindy!

416
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,021
好了

417
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,034
什么? 她刚才就在这里...
What? She was just here...

418
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,034
Cindy

419
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:30,069
Cindy在哪里了?
Where's Cindy?

420
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:31,077
刚才还在这里的
What? She was just here...

421
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:34,058
Cindy  Cindy!

422
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:36,063
-我不知道  她...    -他们捉了她去?
-I don't know, she...    -Did they take her?

423
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,082
她怎么一下子不见了?
How could she just be gone?

424
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:40,042
Cindy  Cindy!

425
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:42,027
我去找她
I'm going after her.

426
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:44,077
不  我们在一起
No. We stay together.

427
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:48,005
我们分开  那正合他们的意
We split up, we give them what they want.

428
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,074
全是你的错
This is all your fault!

429
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:52,045
我们本不应穿越丛林的
We never should have gone through the jungle.

430
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:57,030
你用我们的性命冒险去救他 而他已经快死了
You risked our lives to save him. He's already dead.

431
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,000
这次错在你
This one's on you.

432
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:14,092
那什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

433
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,067
天啊
Oh, God.

434
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:24,057
跑!
Run!

435
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:55,073
她不答应
She said no.

436
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:04,017
我想她知道我为什么要向她要钱
I guess she knew why I asked for the money.

437
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:09,044
在纽约  我可以到你那里短期借宿吗
Can I crash at your place in New York for just a little while?

438
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:14,011
直到我站稳脚跟
Until I get on my feet.

439
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:25,081
我要离开纽约 她给了我一份工作
I'm leaving New York. She offered me a job.

440
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,053
你要为你妈妈干活?
You're going to work for your mother?

441
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:33,063
那份工作真的很好  Shannon
It's a really good job, Shannon.

442
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:40,058
现在我仅有这么多
This is all I have

443
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,085
这个月尾我的信托基金就会入我帐户
but my trust fund will kick in at the end of the month.

444
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:45,085
那样的话  我绝对可以养活你
And after that I can absolutely keep you afloat.

445
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:49,064
谢谢  但是...
Thank you, but...

446
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:52,006
我得想个法子自己赚钱
I'm gonna figure out a way to make my own money.

447
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:56,087
但谁知道以后会怎样 拿去吧!
But who knows when that's gonna be?  Just take it

448
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:59,048
你认为我做不到?
What, you don't think I can do it?

449
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:01,038
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

450
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:05,049
你信我还是不信我  Boone?
Do you believe I can or don't you, Boone?

451
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:09,092
好  你知道吗
OK, you know what?

452
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:13,078
我只想你拿回你的钱 给你妈妈卖命去
I really want you to just take your money. Go work for your mother.

453
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,082
我不想要
I don't want your money!

454
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:20,053
-我只是想帮你  Shannon!  -我不想要你的钱!
-I'm trying to help you, Shannon!  -I don't want your money!

455
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:23,024
那好
OK.

456
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,029
Shannon!

457
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,054
你没事吧
Are you OK?

458
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:41,015
不要帮我!
