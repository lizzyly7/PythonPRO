3
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:59,067
你为什么想娶我女儿?

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,012
Paik先生

5
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,000
我虽是来自一个小渔村但是有我的理想和追求

6
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,006
那你的雄心大志是什么?

7
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,009
开一家酒店

8
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:17,023
为的是有一天能拥有自己的酒店

9
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,083
你父亲是怎么看待这桩婚事的?

10
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,035
我父亲?

11
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,000
他去世了

12
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:37,013
那你都能为我女儿做什么呢?

13
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,050
任何事情

14
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,091
即使是替我做事?

15
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,035
当然

16
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:54,011
我为什么要把女儿嫁给一个轻易就出卖自己理想的男人呢?

17
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,090
因为

18
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:58,067
她就是我的梦想

19
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,041
先生

20
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,035
你到底在做什么?

21
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:44,036
你是不是脑子有问题?

22
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,073
他们又开始了
There they go again.

23
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,012
你说我们是不是该做点什么?
You think we should do something?

24
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,060
我们能做什么呢?
What should we do?

25
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,084
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,091
我不知道 他走过去 然后就开始纠缠不清
I don't know. He walked up and started going off on her again.

27
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,080
把你的手放开!
Get your hands off her!

28
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,030
我发誓你再敢碰她一下
I swear to God, you put your hands on her one more time...

29
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:23,063
把你的手拿开!
Get your hands off me!

30
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:56,030
你和他之间发生过什么?

31
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,057
和谁?

32
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,045
Michael

33
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,015
太可笑了

34
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,062
是吗?

35
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:09,045
什么也没有

36
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,002
这颜色真漂亮

37
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,046
非常漂亮

38
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,083
你一定很高兴结婚吧

39
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,039
我能和我老婆单独呆一会儿吗?

40
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:34,067
千万别忘了楼下还有你们的客人

41
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,036
我好开心

42
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:49,042
真希望你的父亲能目睹这一切

43
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:55,049
对不起  我使你不高兴了

44
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,043
没有

45
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:01,037
不管他在那里 我想他都会以我为荣的

46
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,003
能帮我拉上吗?

47
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:23,006
一定要吗?

48
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:30,074
咱们什么时候去度蜜月?

49
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,043
Sun...

50
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:39,028
你知道我想去 只是现在...

51
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,012
我只想让你父亲看到我是尽职尽责的.

52
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:48,017
他不会拿这个来为难你的 更何况  我是他的女儿

53
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,017
给我6个月...

54
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,048
等我的管理培训全部都结束了

55
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,052
难道我还没有他的汽车公司重要吗?

56
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,031
我保证...

57
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,089
我们会有一个我们梦想已久的蜜月的...

58
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,033
Michael

59
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,099
对不起
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,002
没关系
Don't worry.

61
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,065
是我自己多管闲事
I stuck my nose where it didn't belong.

62
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,044
我自找的
It's on me.

63
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,056
你必须知道
You must understand.

64
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,048
我必须把这个竹筏做好
I got to get this raft finished

65
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,028
那样我就能带我儿子离开这里回家
so I can get my boy and take him home.

66
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,049
当我打你的时候
When I slapped you,

67
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,038
我是在保护你
I was protecting you.

68
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,036
-是吗?  保护我什么?  -避开Jin.
-Yeah? From what?  -From Jin.

69
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:07,013
你不知道他会做出什么样的事情
You don't know what he's capable of.

70
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,001
那不关我事
It's not my problem.

71
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,032
是你的问题
It's yours.

72
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,077
你为什么不试试海胆?
Why don't you try sea urchin?

73
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,047
他们的砰砰声更大
They got more ping.

74
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,009
听着 我知道在海滩上发生了不愉快的事情
So listen,I know things got kind of nasty down there at the beach.

75
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:52,084
我不想被牵连到你们的家事里 但是
I don't want to get involved in husband and wife stuff,but

76
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,052
我认为 你看
I figured, you know,

77
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,060
你也许需要放松
you might need to relax.

78
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,050
所以...
So...

79
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:08,035
来吧 伙计 我好言相劝
Come on, dude, I'm trying here.

80
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,052
好吧
OK.

81
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,044
你不想加入?
You want to be an outsider?

82
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,040
那是你的事
It's your business.

83
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,089
我把这边绑紧
I tied this side down.

84
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,034
你认为这个撑得住吗?
Do you think this is gonna hold?

85
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:33,071
你是不是在海军服过役而你却忘记告诉我了?
Do you have a past in the Navy you've neglected to tell me about?

86
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,054
为什么这么说?
Why?

87
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:38,097
像你这样的一个女人 怎么能打出这样完美的结呢?
How does a woman like you learn how to tie a perfect bowline knot?

88
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,039
跟一些玩帆船的人约会喽
By dating guys with sailboats.

89
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,087
既然你提到了 第一次遇见你的时候 我还担心
Since you bring it up, I've been worried since I first met you

90
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,076
你这辈子会嫁不出去呢
that you might end up a spinster.

91
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,075
然后星期六晚上待在家里绑绳节?
Spending my Saturday nightsalone at home tying knots?

92

或许还有一位超重的姑妈
Perhaps with an overweight aunt.

93
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,058
真是个伤心的画面
It's a very sad image.

94
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,091
或许我们得拿些绳子
Maybe we should get some rope,

95
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,033
在一个周六整晚呆在一起
spend a Saturday night alone together,

老兄...这可不是"玛丽皇后"号

你现在想保护他是吗?
You trying to protect him now? Is that it?

159
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:46,063
她刚才跟我在一起!
She was with me!

160
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:49,051
Walt! 不要 Walt! 回来 回来
Walt! No, Walt! Get back, get back.

No, no, it's done.

162
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,011
Sun 等等!
Sun, wait!

163
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,051
我非打死他不可!
I'm gonna break his damn neck!

164
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,051
Michael 先别生气
Michael, just take it easy, man.

165
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,025
我们并不能确定是Jin干的
We don't know that Jin did this.

166
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,051
-你开玩笑吗?  -Sawyer 闭嘴!
-Are you serious?!  -Sawyer, shut up!

167
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,029
Jack  别这样  早上我们看见他在这沙滩上
Jack, come on, we saw him on the beach this morning!

168
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:03,000
那并不意味着就是他烧了这船
That doesn't mean that he torched the raft.

169
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,018
那是谁干的 Jack?
Yeah, then who did, Jack?

170
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,085
Jin

171
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,096
你在干什么?
What do you want?

172
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,010
我受伤了

173
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,070
是你干的?

174
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:38,045
Michael这么尽力帮咱们离开这个岛...

175
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,047
你为什么要...

176
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,094
Michael?

177
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,097
对于所发生的事 我负全部责任

178
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:54,055
那机器老化了  我本应该...

179
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:57,029
我叫你来不是为了训斥你

180
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:00,084
而是提升你

181
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,099
你将成为我的新任特别助理

182
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,055
先生...

183
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,037
我不知道要...

184
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,049
你知道 Byung Han吧?

185
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,052
环境安全公司的部长?

186
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:20,003
今晚到他家里替我传递个信息

187
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,065
就说我非常不高兴

188
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:31,042
你是谁?

189
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:34,009
我叫Jin-Soo Kwon

190
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:35,057
有什么事?

191
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,063
我替Paik先生做事的

192
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:42,099
Kwon先生...请进

193
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:50,070
请

194
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,089
请坐

195
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:55,066
喝点东西好吗?

196
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,088
不用 谢了

197
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,098
我过来传个信息

198
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,086
请...不要在我女儿面前...

199
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,046
Paik先生对你很生气

200
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,044
就这样

201
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:23,015
谢谢你

202
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,094
谢谢!

203
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,017
真的很感谢

204
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:30,056
请告诉Paik先生我不会再让他生气了...

205
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,083
如果有什么机会让我表示一下歉意...

206
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:44,084
小小意思

207
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,039
这是冠军品种

208
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,034
韩部长

209
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:52,000
很值钱的 请告诉Paik先生我很抱歉

210
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,016
你能帮说一下吗?

211
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,033
我不能...

212
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,032
请你一定要

213
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:02,041
谢谢 谢谢!

214
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,050
有什么事?
What do you want?

215
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,015
我想跟你谈谈 Shannon
I'd like to talk to you about Shannon.

216
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:35,091
你妹妹跟我很可能会不只是朋友
It's very possible your sister and I are going to become more than just friends.

217
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,085
这算什么  中东人的方式?
What is this, some middle eastern thing?

218
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,051
你要我的祝福还是什么?
You want my blessing or something?

219
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,095
我希望你不会反对
My hope is you won't object.

220
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,017
我只是想礼貌些  而不是来请求你的准许
I was extending a courtesy, not asking your permission.

221
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,089
跟你说说我妹妹吧
Let me tell you about my sister.

222
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:05,063
他喜欢成熟的男人...那种可以照顾她的
She likes older men...guys that can take car eof her.

223
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:08,098
我猜在这里你刚好符合这个条件
My guess is in this place you fit the bill.

224
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:13,034
她会让你觉得自己是最好的
She'll make you feel like the greatest guy ever while you

225
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:14,095
然后你给她弄食物 一切她要的东西
get her food,whatever it is she needs,

226
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,057
在得到她所需要的之后
and once she gets what she wants,

227
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,065
她就会离开你
she'll move on.

228
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,023
如果到时她真的离开你
When she does,

229
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:25,004
别太在意
don't take it personally, man.

230
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,033
你把我的船搞砸了 老大
Messed up my ride, chief.

231
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,086
原来你在这
Hey, there you are.

232
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,073
过来帮下忙 我快把它弄坏了
Come help me with this. I'm completely destroying it.

233
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,067
看起来弄得不错啊
You seem to be doing just fine.

234
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:16,096
是吗 好到差不多倒掉了
Yeah, fine at making it collapse.

235
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,032
其实你很能干 Shannon
You're very capable, Shannon.

236
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,043
我相信你能亲自搞定它
I'm sure you'd be all right building it on your own.

237
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,098
你怎么了?
What's going on?

238
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:36,054
或许你该另外找个朋友来帮你搞定你的棚子
Perhaps you should find another friend to help you with your shelter.

239
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:44,029
你告诉我哥了 对吧?
You've been talking to my brother, haven't you?

240
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,046
真恶心!
Oh, gross!

241
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,055
对你来说是恶心 对我可是晚餐
Gross to you, dinner to me.

242
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,091
Boone在哪里?
Boone  where is he?

243
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,073
不知道
Don't know.

244
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:05,039
你什么意思  你不知道?你们两个简直像丛林兄弟
What do you mean, you don't know? You two are like jungle pals.

245
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,089
不好意思 我没见过他
Sorry. I haven't seen him.

246
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,036
那 如果你见到他
Well, if you do see him,

247
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,050
告诉他闭上他的臭嘴 如果他有什么话要说
tell him to keep his stupid mouth shut, and if he has something to say,

248
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,058
当面跟我说 不要把Sayid搅进来
he can leave Sayid out of it and come say it to my face.

249
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,097
我是否应该把它写下来?
Should I be writing this down?

250
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:18,066
告诉他不要管我的闲事
Just…just tell him to stay the hell out of my business.

251
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,024
你喜欢他吗?
Do you like him?

252
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,014
什么?
What?

253
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:24,068
Sayid

254
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:28,075
你是在开玩笑吗?
Are you serious?

255
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:32,048
因为如果你确实喜欢他
Because if you do like him,

256
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,031
那跟你哥有什么关系?
what's it got to do with your brother?

257
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:38,093
你是个成年人了
You're a grown woman.

258
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,073
当然 你可以继续对Boone吼到脖子粗
Sure, you can yell at Boone till you're blue in the face,

259
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,092
但你所做的一切正是他想要的
but all you're doing is giving him what he wants.

260
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,095
是吗  他想要什么?
Yeah, what's that?

261
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,038
你的注意
Your attention.

262
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:55,014
每个人都在这岛上获得了一次新生 Shannon
Everyone gets a new life on this island, Shannon.

263
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,092
也许是时候开始你自己的了
Maybe it's time you start yours.

264
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,081
你肯定很害怕了 对吧?
You must be pretty scared, huh?

265
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,071
害怕  你知道什么是害怕  是吧?
Scared. You understand scared, don't you?

266
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,067
是不是?
Huh?

267
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:19,061
等下你就知道什么叫害怕了  Bruce
If you ain't, you're gonna be, Bruce.

268
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:24,009
一个月前沙滩上或许是医生跟会计师而已
Folks down on the beach might have been doctors and accountants a month ago,

269
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,056
但现在是《苍蝇王》时间了
but it's "lord of the flies" time now.

270
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,037
继续走

271
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,008
停

272
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,056
转过来

273
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,026
坐下

274
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,061
好丰盛啊!

275
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:50,055
这些都是你做的?

276
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:58,001
为你做的 我想我们一起好好享受一顿

277
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:00,015
我很高兴你能做这些

278
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,009
别担心

279
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,094
今晚不工作

280
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,060
谢谢

281
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,081
没事

282
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,019
尝尝这个

283
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,002
为什么把我的工厂给关闭了?

284
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:54,042
因为你没传递好这个简单的信息 我即将损失几百万你知道吗?!

285
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,042
今晚你跟我的同事去Byung Han家

286
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,087
他会告诉你什么是真正的传达信息

287
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,068
等会不要熄火

288
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,031
我会在两分钟内出来

289
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:29,061
我回来的时候 你不要开超速了

290
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:39,015
然后把车开到八公里外的河堤

291
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,070
明白吗?

292
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,081
快跑!快!

293
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,055
Kwon先生...等等 让我解释

294
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,073
明天把工厂开了

295
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:34,047
我刚刚救了你的命

296
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:53,050
他知道该怎么做了

297
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,079
拜托你说句话

298
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:17,076
你受伤了?

299
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,071
这是谁的血?

300
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,080
你刚才去干什么了?

301
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:28,075
到底发生什么事了?

302
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:30,016
我去做事了

303
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,077
做什么事?

304
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:38,005
你替我爸做什么事?

305
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,083
看着我

306
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,032
回答我

307
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,046
看着我

308
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:57,065
我做任何你爸要我做的事

309
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,052
为了我们而做

310
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,050
Michael! 有话好好说!
Michael! Take it easy!

311
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,085
好好说,好啊!
I'll take it easy, all right!

312
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,015
别急 老兄
Hang on, man!

313
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,031
你这家伙烧了我的船?
Hey, man, you burned my raft?

314
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,039
冷静一下
Just calm down.

315
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:06,029
你让开!冷静一下
Hey, step aside, man! Just calm down!

316
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:08,056
你敢烧我的船?你干嘛烧我的船?
You burned my raft? Why'd you burn my raft, man?

317
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,054
冷静一下 想清楚了
Calm down and think about it for a minute.

318
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,039
看看他的手  老兄
Look at his hands, man.

319
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,057
走开啦 Jack  这事跟你无关
Back off, Jack. It's got nothing to do with you.

320
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:14,055
闭嘴! 大家都冷静一下!
Shut it! Everyone's gotta chill out!

321
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,006
他说了什么?
What'd he say?

322
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,083
你在跟我说话?
You say something to me?

323
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,001
Michael!

324
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,081
再说一次
Say it again.

325
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:48,043
不 不 不 你再说一次!
No, no, no, say it again, man!

326
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,024
Michael!

327
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,079
放松点 医生
Hey, easy, doc!

328
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,090
一次一场
One fight at a time.

329
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,089
他说的对 这是他们两的事
He's right. This is between them.

330
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:38,015
住手!
Stop it!

331
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,083
放开他!
Leave him alone!

332
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:55,026
他没有烧你的船
He didn't burn your raft.

333
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,041
你会说英语?
You speak english?

334
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,078
真没有想到
Didn't see that coming.

335
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,094
你能听懂我们的话?
You understood us

336
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:14,066
一直以来? 为什么你什么都不说?
all this time?Why didn't you say anything?

337
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:18,048
当他到的时候你的船已经着火了
Your raft was already on fire when he arrived.

338
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,050
他为了灭火把手给烧伤了
He burned his hands trying to put it out.

339
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,007
那他为什么还要跑掉?
Then why did he run?

340
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:37,007
没说错吧 和我想的一样
Exactly. That's what I thought.

341
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,035
说我先生什么都行
My husband is many things,

342
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:41,081
但他绝不是个说谎的人
but he is not a liar.

343
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,054
你还想跟我们谈撒谎?
You're gonna lecture us about lying, Betty?

344
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:46,022
从他的表情看来
From the look on his face,

345
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,000
即使是你丈夫都不知道你会说英语
even your old man here didn't know you speak English.

346
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,022
我们又怎么知道她是不是包庇他
How do we know she's not covering for him?

347
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,048
因为她没有!
Because she isn't!

348
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,023
他为什么要烧那船?
Why would he burn the raft?

349
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,029
他从第一天开始就缠着我! 人人都知道!
He's been after me since day one! Everybody knows it!

350
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,075
好吧 那是私人恩怨
Okay, it's personal.

351
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:04,007
但他为什么要放弃我们离开这岛的最好机会?
Why would any one of us block an attempt

352
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:08,056
我们谁会自断回家的路呢?
to get home?

353
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,011
我们急切地把矛头指向对方
We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another

354
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,030
却忽略了一个简单而不可否认的事实
that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth

355
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:17,083
那就是问题根本不在这里!在那里!
that the problem isn't here, it's there!

356
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,070
他们袭击我们
They've attacked us!

357
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:23,020
破坏我们  绑架我们  谋杀我们
Sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us.

358
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,087
或许是时候停止相互责备了
Maybe it's time we stop blaming us

359
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:27,055
担心一下他们吧!
and started worrying about them!

360
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:35,096
这个岛上并不只有我们 大家都知道!
We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it!

361
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,002
他没有做过
He did not do it.

362
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,031
看看这
Look at this.

363
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,027
一点可用的东西都没有
I can't salvage a thing.

364
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:44,072
浮筒 甲板...
Pontoons, the decking...

365
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:47,009
全部麻绳都给火烧了!
fire burnt up all the twine!

366
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,012
该死的!
Damn it!

367
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,041
该死!
Damn it!

368
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,072
老天...
God...

369
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,099
对不起 孩子
I'm sorry, man.

370
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:06,025
不
No.

371
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,068
过来
Come here.

372
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,008
过来
Come here.

373
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:11,040
过来
Come here.

374
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:13,005
听着...
Look...

375
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:15,034
人人都会遇到挫折
we all have setbacks.

376
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,074
我是说 上天知道的
I mean, god knows, man.

377
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:21,065
这就是生活
That's just life.

378
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,059
我们重新来过  好吗?
We'll start over, all right?

379
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:27,058
你要再建一艘?
You're gonna build another one?

380
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,076
一艘更好的
A better one.

381
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,060
我能帮忙吗?
Can I help?

382
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:35,022
你当然可以帮忙啦
No doubt you can help.

383
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,081
你在干吗?

384
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,090
回答我

385
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,090
你想去哪里...

386
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,055
去沙滩?

387
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:58,088
你决定就这样对我是吗?

388
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,017
为什么不告诉我你没有烧那船?

389
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,040
你倒是说话啊  Jin

390
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,055
我究竟做了什么你要这样对我?

391
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:20,009
我们什么时候开始这样不说话了?

392
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:26,062
我当时打算离开你的!
I was going to leave you!

393
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,077
我当时真想一走了之
I was going to get away.

394
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:37,018
但你让我改变了注意
But you made me change my mind.

395
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,025
你让我相信你还爱着我
You made me think that you still loved me.

396
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,089
我想回到从前

397
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,030
我们能不能...

398
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,093
重新开始?

399
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,034
对不起 爸爸

400
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:03,015
请原谅我

401
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:05,066
我曾经...

402
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,033
...以你为耻

403
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,019
她人长什么样的?

404
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:30,030
很漂亮

405
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,051
聪明

406
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,036
冷静

407
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,078
我们俩互不说话了

408
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,092
这是为什么?

409
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,087
因为我不能告诉她...

410
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:47,062
...关于她爸爸的事

411
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,007
在一个现实的世界里

412
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:55,009
她会讨厌他的  而不是我

413
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,093
这是个现实的世界

414
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:06,060
你不知道我干了什么

415
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:09,047
你是我儿子

416
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:12,070
你做了什么都没关系

417
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,084
我真希望可以重来

418
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:18,021
为什么不行?

419
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:21,029
我有一些职责在身

420
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,075
比你妻子更重要?

421
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:34,047
他爸爸要我把手表送到他在 悉尼跟洛杉矶的合伙人那里

422
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:40,039
就算是为他所做的最后一件事吧

423
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,047
...然后离开

424
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,000
不再回来

425
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:50,053
到美国去

426
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:55,066
挽救你的婚姻

427
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:24,008
太迟了

428
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,031
那代表什么?
What was that for?

429
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:28,062
每个人都在这岛上获得一次新生
Everyone gets a new life on this island.

430
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,015
我想从现在开始
I'd like to start now.

431
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,040
给自己找了个对手?
Got yourself an opponent?

432
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:59,002
Hurley 欠我83,000美元
Hurley owes me $83,000.

433
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,070
我跟他说我会给他一次机会赢回去的
I told him I'd give him a chance to win it back.

434
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,003
我很久没有跟你玩过了
It's been a while since you and I played.

435
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:11,075
但我可没有83,000美元
I don't have $83,000.

436
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,095
没关系
That's okay.

437
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:17,012
你爸呢?
Where's your pop?

438
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,085
我想在沙滩那边
Down at the beach, I think.

439
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:21,028
天黑后他不准我离开山洞
I'm not allowed to leave the caves after dark.

440
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:25,064
你有爸爸吗?
Do you have a dad?

441
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:27,084
人人都有爸爸
Everyone's got a dad.

442
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:29,072
他酷吗?
Is he cool?

443
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:33,056
不
No.

444
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:35,096
不,他不酷
No, he's not.

445
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:44,011
好!
Yes!

446
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:45,042
不错
Good for you.

447
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:50,037
可以问你点事情吗?
Hey, you mind if I ask you something?

448
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,036
当然
Sure.

449
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,021
你为什么烧了那船  Walt?
Why did you burn the raft, Walt?

450
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,034
别担心  我不会告诉别人的
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell.

451
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,085
你肯定是有很好的理由的
You must have had a really good reason.

452
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:21,002
我不想再换地方了
I don't want to move anymore.

453
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:25,072
我长到现在老是在搬家
I've been moving places my whole life.

454
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:31,071
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

455
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,038
我也喜欢这里
I like it here, too.

456
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,041
船
Boat.

457
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,041
背景音乐是Damien Rice的歌曲  名字是 Delicate

458
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,030
该死的
Son of a bitch.

459
