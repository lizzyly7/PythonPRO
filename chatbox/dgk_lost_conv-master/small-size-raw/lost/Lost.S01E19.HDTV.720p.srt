迷失 前情提要
Previously on Lost

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:21,080
-你没有告诉我你的处境  -我的处境压根不是问题
-You didn't tell us your condition. -My condition is not an issue.

5
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,050
我这样生活了四年了

6
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,044
我会付钱让你飞回悉尼的

7
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:27,020
我不想回悉尼去
I don't want to go back to Sydney!

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,073
你不知道你现在在和谁说话
You don't know who you're dealing with.

9
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:31,017
永远别跟我说有什么我做不到的...永远
Don't tell me what I can't do!

10
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,079
这是命运 这就是我的命运
This is destiny.This is my destiny!

11
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:36,077
这是...我应该做到的 混蛋
I'm supposed to do this, damn it!

12
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:40,015
你如何打开舱门?
How do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch,

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,050
没有把手和销子的舱门
no discernible way of opening it?

14
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,020
那是什么?
What's that?

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,067
一个游戏
A game.

16
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,042
这是我最喜欢的游戏 我经常和我的兄弟一起玩
My favorite game.I used to play with my brother.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,082
这游戏叫做老鼠陷阱
It's called Mouse Trap.

18
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:01,073
怎么玩?
How do you play?

19
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:05,059
起初 你拥有零散的全部零件
You start with all these parts off the board.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:10,096
然后 一步一步的来设置陷阱
And then, one by one,you build the trap.

21
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:15,025
鞋子 桶子 盆子 一块连着一块 拼起来
Shoe. Bucket. Tub.Piece by piece,it all comes together.

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,011
然后你等着你的对手跑到这个干酪圈里
And then you wait till your opponent lands here on the old Cheese Wheel.

23
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:25,006
如果你拼接合适的话 你就能触发机关陷阱了
Then if you set it up just right,you spring the trap.

24
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,080
你来吧 小兄弟
Go ahead, kiddo.

25
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,081
夫人 我能帮你做什么不?
May I help you, ma'am?

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,014
好的
Yes...

27
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,028
你能告诉我橄榄球在哪儿么?
Could you tell me where the footballs are?

28
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:46,033
标准橄榄球在8号走廊 冲撞球在15号
Yeah. Aisle eight for regulation.Aisle fifteen for Nerf.

29
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:49,061
好的 谢谢 很感谢
Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.

30
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,054
我说 根本就没法打开这个舱门
You want my opinion?

31
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,043
Boone 你应该有点信心
Boone you gotta have some faith.

32
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:09,004
我们得做的就是打破玻璃 然后再进去
All we gotta do is break the glass,and then we're in.

33
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:11,086
投石器能提供半吨重的力量
Trebuchet delivers half a ton of force.

34
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:14,050
为什么大家叫它投石器? 它更像一个弹弓
Why is it a trebuchet? Looks like a catapult.

35
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:18,033
它就叫投石器的原因是 因为它就是投石器
It's called a trebuchet,because it's a trebuchet.

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,057
我不懂 伙计
I don't get you, man.

37
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,084
一会儿你像个文学家似的引用尼采的话 一会儿你又成了一个工程师
One minute you're quoting Nietzsche,now you're an engineer.

38
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:25,058
我认为我不能拼出"trebuchet(投石器)"
I don't think I can spell "trebuchet."

39
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,084
是"T"结尾的
There's a "T" on the end.

40
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,047
John 我说正经的
I'm serious. John

41
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,019
我们两周来天天来这儿
We've been coming here every day for two weeks

42
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,082
你从不说说你自己
You never talk about yourself.

43
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,084
每个人都有他的故事
Everybody's got a story.

44
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,085
我的故事会让你厌烦
My story would bore you.

45
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:02,050
三  二  一
Three. Two. One.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,017
应该能行的
This was supposed to work.

47
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,060
应该能行的
This was supposed to work!

48
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,045
John

49
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,090
你的腿 伙计
Your leg, man.

50
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,092
还好吧?
You OK?

51
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,063
没事
Yeah.

52
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,007
我很好
I'm fine.

53
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,037
你的投石器...
Your trebuchet.

54
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,035
为什么没起作用?
Why didn't it work?

55
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:42,052
因为它还不够结实
It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough.

56
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,038
我认为那玻璃破不了
That won't break,whatever it's made of.

57
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:47,022
如果加上足够的力量 任何东西都能破坏
Everything breaks if you apply the right force.

58
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,066
那么我们要造另一个你的发明并且希望这次能成功?
We'll build another invention and hope it works?

59
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:53,011
如果又没用呢?
What if it doesn't?

60
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,024
那么这小岛会告诉我们怎么做的
The island will tell us what to do.

61
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,016
我们应该回去那儿 抢救那些碎片
We should get back there. Salvage those pieces.

62
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:07,035
你的腿还好吧?
Your leg OK?

63
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:10,000
没事
It's fine.

64
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,001
你没事吧 伙计?
You all right, guy?

65
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,008
-你为什么跟着我?  -很抱歉
-You following me?  -I'm sorry.

66
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:01,000
-你是谁?  -我是你母亲
-Who are you?  -I'm your mother.

67
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:14,093
听着 夫人...我不知道为什么你认为我是你儿子
Look, Ms...I don't know why you think I'm your son

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,060
或是你怎么找到我的 但是...
Or how you found me, but...

69
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,000
你是被收养的 不是么?
You're adopted, aren't you?

70
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,082
不 我是在一个孤儿院长大的
No, I was raised in a foster home.

71
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,057
确切的说是一些孤儿院
Well, several foster homes, actually.

72
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,073
瞧 我不愿意无礼
Look, I don't mean to be rude.

73
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,011
你要从我这儿得到什么?
What do you want from me?

74
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:36,017
我想告诉你 你很特别...非常特别
I want to tell you that you're special.Very special.

75
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,098
你是一个计划的一部分
You are part of a design.

76
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,088
你已经意识到了 是么?
You do realize that, don't you?

00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,069
大事
Great things.

80
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,030
我的父亲...
My father...

81
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,096
他还活着么?
...is he still alive?

82
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,045
还活着?
Still alive?

83
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:08,086
John  你还不知道么?
Oh, John don't you understand?

84
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,028
你没有父亲
You don't have a father.

85
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:16,011
你是一个完美的设想
You were immaculately conceived.

86
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
哪一个?

你确定? 这个就是我在用的 但是什么都没发生
You're sure? This is the one I've been using, and nothing's happening.

89
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,047
那没用我很抱歉
I'm sorry it's not helping.

90
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,053
什么东西没用?
What's not helping?

他头痛

96
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:59,045
那家伙不是藏着一大箱阿司匹林么?
Doesn't the guy have aspirin stashed away somewhere?

97
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:01,071
他说阿司匹林没用
He says aspirin didn't help.

98

-你没事吧?  -是的 没事

101
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,071
那么凯特 我们谈论的人是谁呢?
So, who are we talking about then, Kate?

102
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,003
-Kate  -怎么
-Kate.  -Uh-huh.

103
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,024
我只是认为他有很大的麻烦
There might be something wrong with him.

104
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,031
那他怎么认为?
What does he think?

105
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,064
-他说他很好 但是...  -那么他就是很好
-Says he's fine...  -Then he's fine.

106
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:33,000
他能继续下去 可能会有...
He could be playing it down. There could be something...

107
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:37,034
听着 我找到一个人然后确信他没事就再好不过了
I'd love to check the guy out and make sure he's OK,

108
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,060
但是我们都知道唯一能使我从麻烦中解脱的 就是一句爽快地俏皮话
but we both know all I'm gonna get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner,

109
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,069
并且如果我真的很幸运 可能就可以有一个崭新的绰号了
and if I'm real lucky,a brand-new nickname.

110
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:45,033
那个我很在行
I'm just over it.

111
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,001
你迟到了
You're late.

112
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,071
什么迟到了?
Late for what?

113
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,010
工作迟到了
Late for work.

114

我认为我已经完成工作了 John
I think I'm done working John.

115
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,088
抱歉 什么?
I'm sorry. What?

116
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,097
这根本没用
This is useless.

117
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,047
你打不开那个东西
You can't open that thing up.

118
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,080
别跟我说有什么我做不到的
Don't tell me what I can't do.

119
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:10,012
你还不懂么? 不可能的 你不可能进去的
You get it?It's a dead end.You're not getting in.

120
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,032
那不可能 我们不是偶然发现这个的
We didn't find this by accident.

121
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,024
-我们应该可以...  -哦 我们应该可以的 是不?

我们能行的 是不?
We're supposed to open it,right?

123
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,066
我们做得到的 是不?
We're supposed to open it,Right?

124
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,036
那么告诉我 John
Then tell me something John.

125
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,094
如果我们应该可以打开它的 那么我们为什么到现在还没打开呢?
If we're supposed to open it,why haven't we opened it yet?

126
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,045
这岛会给我们提示的
The island will send us a sign.

127
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:29,001
"这岛会的..."
"The island will..."

128
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:32,006
所有现在发生的一切是在考验我们信念 和我们的承诺
All that's happening now is our faith is being tested.

129

但是我们会打开的 这个岛会告诉我们方法的

这岛会给我们哪种提示? 
What kind of sign will the island send us?

131
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,009
看到那个了么?
Did you see that?

132
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,057

She was institutionalized.A few times.

151
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:24,085
不是因为犯罪或是暴力
Nothing criminal or violent.

152
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,069
是一种精神分裂症
It's a type of schizophrenia.

153
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,086
显然 如果她意识清楚地话 她是没事的
If she stays on her meds, she's OK.

154
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,040
我的父亲呢?
What about my father?

155
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,088
这是个问题
Here's the thing.

156
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:41,056
你母亲把你丢了 那你可以去质问她
Your mother sought you out, so she's fair game.

157
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:43,057
但是这个人
But this guy,

158
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,050
可能他根本不知道有你这个人
maybe he doesn't even know you exist.

159
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,073
我用了足够的时间来了解...
Now, I've done this enough times to know...

160
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:54,005
这件事并不是有意而为的 可能它让人以为是那样
...this stuff isn't meant to be,even though it may feel that way.

161
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:57,068
瞧 将来可能不会有个圆满的结局
Look, this probably won't have a happy ending.

162
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:02,041
那么...
So...

163
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,020
你要知道么?
...do you want it or not?

164
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:08,078
我要
I want it.

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,077
-你的名字?  -John John Locke
-Your name is? -John John Locke.

166
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,096
我是Anthony Cooper的儿子
I'm Anthony Cooper's son.

167
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,048
Cooper先生没有儿子
Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.

168
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,011
告诉他我什么都不想要
Tell him I don't want anything.

169
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:33,061
我的母亲是Emily Locke 麻烦你了
My mother is Emily Locke.Please.

170
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,028
等一下
Just a minute.

171
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:41,072
Cooper先生 是John·Cooper 他说他是您儿子
Mr. Cooper, I got John Locke here,says he's your son.

172
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,074

173
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,023
你可以进去了先生
Well, you can go on in, sir.

174
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,095
多少有点尴尬
This is awkward.

175
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,043
谢谢您接见我 先生 我是...John
Thank you for seeing me, sir.I'm... John.

176
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,016
也许我们得为这个庆祝一下
Something tells me I'm gonna want a drink for this?

177
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,034
-要点喝的么?  -恩 好阿
-You want a drink? -Yeah. All right. Great.

178
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,063
-苏格兰的 行么?  -哦 那...谢谢了
-Scotch OK? -Yeah, that's... Thanks.

179
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,014
-那么 是谁找到谁的?  -抱歉 先生?
-So who found who? -I'm sorry, sir?

180
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,058
艾米莉 你母亲
Emily. Your mother.

181
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,092
是她找到你的 还是你找到她的?
Did she find you,or did you find her?

182
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,047
是她找到我的
She found me.

183
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,074
她看起来怎样?
How did she look?

184
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,045
我看很好
All right, I guess.

185
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,060
她有说我什么没?
She say anything about me?

186
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,069
她说我没有父亲
She said I didn't have a father.

187
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:42,064
我是一个完美的设想
That I was immaculately conceived.

188
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:47,002
真的? 
Really?

189
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,038
我想那样我就成了上帝了?
Well, I guess that makes me God, huh?

190
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:54,047
你生下来一年后我才知道有你
I didn't know you existed until a year after you were born.

191
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:59,003
她说她甚至不想要这个孩子 不想把你生下来
She told me she wasn't gonna have the baby, you, at all.

192
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,000
然后她就消失了
She drops off the face of the planet.

193
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,061
当她再次出现时 她问我要钱
She turns up asking for money,

194
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,093
她说她让别人收养了你
telling me she put you up for adoption.

195
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:07,054
你喝这个 还是要其它的?
You gonna drink that or what?

196
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:12,053
你有你自己的家么?
You have a family of your own?

197
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:16,000
没有 先生

199
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,083
我试过几次 但没有用
I tried it a couple times.Didn't take.

200
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,068
-你打猎么?  -不打
-Do you hunt? -No.

201
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,031
你不是做动物权利保护工作的吧 是么?
You're not an animal rights nut-job?

202
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,094
没有了
No, sir.

203
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:31,024
这周日你有事没?

204
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,019
没有
Nothing.

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,093
打猎去如何?
You wanna go hunting?

206
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:38,090

207
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,016
是的 我很想去
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

208
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,055
我昨晚做了个梦
I had a dream last night.

209
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:49,088
我要一个提示
I asked for a sign.

210
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:54,074
然后我看见一架飞机坠落在了...那儿的一个海滩上
And then I saw a plane crash.A Beechcraft.Right out there.

211
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,070
那是一个梦
It was a dream, but...

212
00:14:57,003 --> 00:15:00,019
但是这是我所经历的最真实的事了
...it was the most real thing I've ever experienced.

213
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,043
我知道现在该去哪儿了
I know where to go now.

214
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,002
去干吗?
Go for what?

215
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,061
去找打开这混蛋舱门的东西
To find what we need to open this bastard up.

216
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,034
你用这种古怪的手法想让我看到我的姐妹被吃了么?
You using that paste that made me see my sister get eaten?

217
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,085
不 Boone 不是
No, Boone, no.

218
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,079
John 我要告诉你 提示和梦还有...
Cause, I gotta tell you,signs and dreams and...

219
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,098
Theresa是谁?
Who's Theresa?

220
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:23,004
什么?
What?

221
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,032
"Theresa从楼梯上掉下来了 Theresa从楼梯上掉下来了"
"Theresa falls up the stairs.Theresa falls down the stairs."

222
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,008
在梦里你是这么说的
You were saying that in the dream.

223
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,025
你是怎么知道那个的?
How would you know about that?

224
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:40,003
我不知道 Boone 但是我们应该可以去那儿的
I don't know,but we're supposed to go to this place.

225
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,047
我们应该可以找到那架飞机的
We're supposed to find that plane.

226
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,016
你要和我来不?
Will you come with me?

227
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,003
我本来想问进展的怎样了
I was gonna ask you how this was going,

228
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,015
现在看来确实进展很快
but it's coming together fast.

229
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,091
那场火灾没有损失所有的东西
Fire wasn't a total loss.

230
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,048
我们从第一个建造的那里学到了些东西 
We learned things from building the first one,

231
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,000
这让我们避免了反复试验和重复错误
which is saving us from trial and error.

232
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,037
现在的是...
Now it's just...

233
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,066
试验
trial.

234
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,049
好的 好的 好的 好的
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:25,073
是的 伙计 我知道 可以可以可以了
Yeah, man, I know."Now, now."

236
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,044
熟悉了一点韩语了是么?
Picking up a little Korean?

237
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:31,068
是的 现在我知道怎么说"快点"还有"白痴"
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I know how to say "faster" and "idiot".

238
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,016
我听说你的头有点问题
I hear you're having trouble with your head.

239
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,081
现在她调用你来问我了么?
Now she got you making house calls?

240
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,021
你也对光很敏感 是么?
You're sensitive to the light too?

241
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:55,067
我对你很敏感...
I'm sensitive to you...

242
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:57,045
好的 再见
All right.We'll see you.

243
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:01,020
医生

244
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,003
对光敏感...问题严重么?
Sensitivity to the light,that bad?

245
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,024
看情况了
Depends.

246
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,057
看什么情况?
On what?

247
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,030
看是什么引起你的头痛了
On what's causing your headaches.

248
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,070
是瘤或是什么的
It's not like it's a tumor or something.

249
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,016
什么使你认为是个瘤?
What makes you think it's a tumor?

250
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:22,072
-我没认为  -很好 那么好的
-I don't.Great.  -OK then.

251
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,004
我的叔叔
My uncle...

252
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:34,090
他  患脑瘤死了
he, uh......died of a brain tumor.

253
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,080
是么?
Yeah?

254
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,056
肿瘤会不会遗传的?
That run in the family? Tumors?

255
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:42,000
是什么样的瘤?
What type of tumor was it?

256
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,059
可以杀死你的那种
The type that kills you.

257
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,084
你不觉得很有趣么?
Do you smell anything funny?

258
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:51,026
脑瘤让人产生幻觉...比方说像是什么烧起来了
Brain tumors bring on phantom smells.Maybe like something burning.

259
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,032
只是头痛
Just headaches.

260
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,052
那我想你没事
Well, I'm sure you're fine, then.

261
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,018
听着 如果这让你很担心 我能给你做下测试
If this is worrying you,there's tests I could do.

262
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,019
抱歉 医生
Sorry, doc.

263
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,040
听起来很有趣
Sounds fun, but...

264
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,003
但是我的保险过期了
my insurance ran out.

265
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,027
保险过期了
Insurance ran out.

266
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,024
很好笑的笑话
That's a good one.

267
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,013
我可能某天在舱口说起了她的名字
I could've mentioned her name out by the hatch one day.

268
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,088
-谁?  -Theresa.
-Who?  -Theresa.

269
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,056
可能是我的自言自语
Maybe I was talking to myself.

270
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:32,041
可能是吧
Maybe.

271
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,013
但是你没有
But you didn't.

272
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,097
那么在梦里你看见飞机坠毁 是么?
So, in this dream you saw a plane crash, right?

273
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:41,013
是的
Yeah.

274
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,083
好的 我们都经历过坠机的事实
OK.The fact that we were just in a plane crash,

275
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,033
你有没稍微想想...
you didn't think for one second...

276
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,027
John 你没事吧?
John, you OK?

277
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,012
我很好
I'm fine.

278
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,077
你的腿怎么了?
What is wrong with your leg?

279
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,072
我没事
I'm fine.

280
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,058
什么?
What?

281
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,066
有人从营地远远地到这儿来?
Someone from camp hiked all the way out here?

282
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,043
你觉得这是从哪儿来的?
Where do you think it came from?

283
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,083
他
Him.

284
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,080
-早上好 Eddie  -Locke先生 早上好
-Morning, Eddie. -Morning, Mr. Locke.

285
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,043
你们要去抓几只鸟么?
You gonna get birds again?

286
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:34,046
我希望这样
I hope so.

287
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,028
Anthony?

288
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:49,016
你应该12点再来
You weren't supposed to be here till 12:00.

289
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,097
我以为是11点
I thought you said 11:00.

290
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,036
这是什么?
What is this?

291
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,060
这是透析仪
It's a dialysis machine.

292
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,055
我的肾不行了
My kidney's failing.

293
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:05,022
混蛋的医生说我需要移植
Damn doctors say I need a transplant.

294
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,005
什么时候?
When?

295
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,024
明天 如果适合我的话
Tomorrow, if it were up to me.

296
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:10,005
我在捐赠人的名单上
I'm on the donor list.

297
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:13,034
但是我是个老人 那名单又很长
But I'm an old man,and it's a long list.

298
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,025
John 透析仪过会儿就好了
The dialysis will be fine for awhile.

299
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,053
我不会告诉你明确的原因的
I didn't tell you for this exact reason.

300
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:25,011
我不想让这些扰了这么美好的一天 你也不能
I'm not gonna let this spoil a fantastic day, and neither should you.

301
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:29,080
所以 这儿完成了后 我们吃顿好的午饭然后去打鸟

通常是在中午他们吵我的时候
Usually they hit me middle of the day.

322
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,023
你用那该死的东西干嘛?
What are you doing with that?

323
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:06,047
看看你的瞳孔对变化的事物的反映

去死吧 医生

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,052
不 Jack不会知道起先我是怎么了
No. Jack wouldn't know the first thing about what's wrong with me.

351
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,002
John

352
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:41,078
-我们得...  -不 不

353
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:44,038
你怎么了 疯了?
What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?

354

-我座在轮椅里  -什么?

飞机 我们的飞机
The plane, our plane,

357
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:56,071
起飞时我座在轮椅里 但是坠落后就没了
I was in that chair when we took off,but not after we crashed.

358
00:23:57,017 --> 00:24:01,017
-你为什么会在轮椅里?  -这不重要了
-Why were you in a wheelchair?  -That doesn't matter anymore.

359
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:07,067
但是这个岛... 它改变了我 它使我更充实了
But this island,it changed me.It made me whole.

360
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:10,089
现在它想要回去了 我不知为什么
Now it's trying to take it back,and I don't know why.

361
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:15,093
但是它想让我跟着我所看见的
But it wants me to follow what I saw.

362
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,000
什么?
What?

363
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:20,020
四周前  我也不相信我自己
Four weeks ago,I wouldn't have believed it.

364

我们注定要找到一些东西...

一些能帮助我们进入舱门的东西

我知道
I know it.

368
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,099
但是我们得继续前进
But we gotta keep going.

369
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,023
好吧
OK.

370
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,069
你能走么?
Can you move your legs?

371
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,047
扶我起来 小子
Just help me up, son.

372
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:55,014
那些鸽子飞得比你想象的快很多
These doves fly a lot faster than you think.

373
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,067
所以你得努力跟上它们
So you gotta really lead them.

374
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,004
如果你在高处放飞了...
If you have to drop it in high cover...

375
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:08,003

John 你母亲...
John your mother...

378
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:21,053
她可能有点疯 
John, your mother,she may be a little crazy,

379
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:24,064
但是 至少把我们联系到了一起
but at least she brought us together.

380
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,041
感谢上帝这发生在现在 
And thank God it happened now,

381
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:28,061
在我们都还有时间的时候
while we still have time.

我的卧室在楼梯的最上面

一天她踩空了一脚

扭了她的脖子
Broke her neck.

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,030
我当时6岁
I was six.

那是你看见的飞机么?
Is that the plane you saw?

398
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,053
没关系
Doesn't matter.

399
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:58,046
重要的是我们找到了
What's important is that we found it.

400
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,078
并且重要的是里面有什么
What's important is what's inside it.

401
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:05,070
里面有什么 John?
What is inside of it John?

402
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,065
这就的需要你爬上去看看了
You're gonna have to climb up there for us and find out.

你还能改变主意
You can still change your mind.

404

420
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:48,079
比如看书

421
