再见  John

00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,045
你要对他们撒谎
You're gonna have to lie.

这是唯一能保护它的办法
It's the only way to protect it.

4
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,052
这只是个岛  John
It's an island, john.

00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,055
没有人需要保护它
No one needs to protect it.

6
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:11,098
这是个奇迹发生的地方

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,012
世上根本就没有奇迹
There's no such thing as miracles.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,038
我们得把所有多余的东西

能把一艘航母炸掉
To blow up a bloody aircraft carrier.

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,095
这是个收音机
This is a-a radio receiver.

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,014
就会远程引爆炸弹
it triggers the bomb remotely.

00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,015
我已经投了一份人身保? Ben
I took out a bit of a-a life insurance policy, ben.

对不起  先生  不好意思打搅你一下

一个安全的地方

00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,059
我干嘛要跟你走啊?
And why would I go anywhere with you?

32
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:53,013
我貌似有N久没有见过你了
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

33
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,004
因为情况有变
Because circumstances have changed.

34
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,035
什么样的情况?
What circumstances?

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,091
Bentham死了

据说他是自杀
They said it was suicide.

40
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,099
什么叫"据说"他是自杀?
What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide?

41
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,010
-还有你干嘛叫他"Bentham"?  他名叫...  -别说出来
- And why are you calling him "bentham"? his name is-- don't say it.

42
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,082
我们被监视了
We're being watched.

43
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,095
老兄  我一直在
Dude, I've been having

44
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,018
和死人聊着天
Regular conversations with dead people.

45
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,023
我准是有妄想症
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

46
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,025
我刚杀了一个从上星期起
I just killed a man who's been perched

47
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,077
就守在门外的家伙
Outside this facility for the last week.

48
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,058
我就是全靠妄想症而得以生存至今
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

49
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:45,067
我们不是要回去吧?
We're not going back, are we?

50
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,030
不是
No.

51
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,031
只是去个安全的地方
Just somewhere safe.

52
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,078
那好吧
Okay then.

53
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,074
等一下

将死  Eko先生

-货船在哪  -我也不知道  我保持着正确航向
- Where's the freighter? -  I don't know.  I stayed on course.

56
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,027
他们一定又是把船开走了
They must have it on the move again.

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,023
还剩多少油?
How much fuel?

58
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,049
还能坚持4到5分钟
Four, five minutes worth,

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,039
除非还有人想跳下去减轻负荷
Unless somebody else wants to jump.

60
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:45,031
我们一找到船就折回去找他
As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.

61
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:51,046
船在那儿! 我看到了! 就在我们后面!
There it is! the boat! I see it! behind us!

62
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,018
Ben  帮帮我
Ben, help me.

63
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,021
要是他死了  船上的人就都得玩完了
If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.

64
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,003
那可不关我的事  John
That's not my problem, john.

65
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,068
挺住  挺住!
Hang on, man. hang on!

66
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:28,098
不管你逃到天涯海角...
Wherever you go...

67
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,014
Widmore...
Widmore...

68
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,039
都会上门来找你算帐的
He'll find you.

69
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,097
没准我先找他算帐呢
Not if I find him first.

70
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,068
不要啊  不要

你们俩现在就走  让所有人都离开船

73
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,058
走啊!

我留下来

76
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,049
糟糕
Oh, bloody hell.

快离开啊! 要爆炸了!

What are you doing?! I don't care what the hell he's screaming!

飞机都冒烟了!  我必须让这铁家伙着陆!
I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!

86
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,088

不!  不!  你不明白!

你们现在都给我下船!

我们还要多久才能再次起飞?

正如你知道

我们一直在隐瞒我们以前待的地方

还有我们所遭遇的事

正如你所知
As you know,

我们不是唯一离开那座岛的人
We're not the only ones who left the island.

158
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,012
Kwon小姐

飞回去!  我们一定要找到Jin!

-Sun  那里已经没有人了!  -你怎么知道!
- Sun, there's nobody down there! - you can't see anything from here!

00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,090
-油不够了!  我们不能回去!  -飞回去!  我知道他在那儿!
- We didn't get enough fuel! - we can't go back! go lower! I know he's there!

163
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,086
-Sun  我...Sun  我很抱歉  他已经...  -他在那里!
- Sun, I'm--sun, I'm so sorry. he's not-- - he's down there!

164
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,083
我知道他就在那里!
I know he's down there!

165
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:03,005
-我们得走了!  -不要!  我不要丢下他!
- We gotta go! - no! I'm not leaving him!

166
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:06,067
不能去找他!  不  我们不能丢下他! 
Can't get to him! no, we're not leaving him!

167
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,047
不能!  快调头!

168
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,098
Sun!  sun!  他死了!
Sun! sun! it's gone!

169
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,077
他死了
He's gone.

170
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:21,011
嘘  嘘
Shh. shh.

171
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:31,034
Lapidus!

172
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,048
载我们回小岛

176
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,032
不!
No!

177
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,038
为什么?
Why?

178
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,028
什么为什么?
"why" what?

179
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,056
你知道那东西能炸毁船  为什么还要杀死他?
Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?

180
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,084
John  我当时真的难以控制我的情绪
Well, john, I really wasn't thinking straight.

181
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,010
有的时候...
Sometimes...

182
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,048
即使英明的决策
Good command decisions get compromised

183
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,061
也会受到不好的情绪所影响
By bad emotional responses.

184
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,072
我相信你能公私分明
I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job

185
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,091
比我做得更好
Of separating the two than I ever did.

186
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,006
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

187
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:25,092
-我在问你呢!  -如果我是你  我会躲一下
- I asked you a question! - if I were you, I'd duck.

188
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,017
我最好得改改了
I better change.

189
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,054
游泳的好天气啊
Nice day for a swim.

190
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,070
你还在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

191
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,096
在想要不要去泡一泡
Decided to take a dip.

192
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,020
你在庆祝什么?
Whatcha celebratin'?

193
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,076
我没有在庆祝
I'm not celebrating.

194
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,023
那是我们的船吗?
Is that our boat?

195
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,034
曾经是
It was.

196
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,034
穿那个做什么?
What's that for?

197
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,063
我要去一个冰冷的地方
I'm going somewhere cold.

198
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,004
那我呢?
Then where is mine?

199
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,054
因为你不会和我一起去
Because you're not going with me.

200
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,073
-不  我会和你去的  -不会  John  你不会
- Yes, I am going with you.- no, john, you're not.

201
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,080
Jacob告诉过我要怎么做
Jacob told me what we had to do.

202
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,010
你不能就这样全权决定了...
You don't get to make all the decisions--

203
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,071
他告诉你要做什么  但没有跟你说怎么做
He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how

204
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:31,073
-因为他要我来承担后果  -什么后果
- Because he wants me to suffer the consequences. - what consequences?

205
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,020
不管是谁移动了这岛就不会再活着出来
Whoever moves the island can never come back.

206
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:46,015
所以你得坐上电梯  John
So I'd like you to get on the elevator, john,

207
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,037
上去吧
And go back up.

208
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,085
Richard和我的人
Richard and my people will be waiting

209
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:54,008
-在兰花站西边2英里处等着  -等我?
- 2 miles east of the orchid. -  waiting for me?

210
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,027
他们愿意  乐意

地告诉你他们所知道的事
To share what they know.

然后他们会对你马首是瞻
And then they will follow your every word.

213
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,015

216
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:36,098
你会知道的  John
You'll find your way, john.

217
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,054
你向来如此
You always do.

218
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:18,085

四周除了水  什么也没有
There's nothing but water in every direction!

229
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,003
现在没关系了
Doesn't matter now.

230
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,055
我们完了  没油了
That's it, people! we're out of fuel!

231

穿上救生衣  我们要入水了

我不敢相信他办到了
I can't believe he did it.

275
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,003
谁做了什么?
Who did what?

276
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,079

接着就不见了  那么...

伙计  除非是我们看花眼了

但是...如果你有另外的解释  伙计

我愿意洗耳恭听

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,084
万能的主啊

它调头了!
It's turning! hey!

294

撒什么谎?
Lie about what?

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,099
每一件事情  所有的事情
Everything, all of it,

我们坠机来到这个岛上之后的所有事
Every moment since we crashed on the island.

300
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:14,010
Jack...我虽然是刚刚才和你们一起
Jack... now I know I'm new to this group and everything,

301
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,034
但我觉得此时此地
But isn't this the place where everybody

302
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,001
-我们应该欢呼雀跃呀?  -你的货船...
- Starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?  - your freighter...

303
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:21,078
