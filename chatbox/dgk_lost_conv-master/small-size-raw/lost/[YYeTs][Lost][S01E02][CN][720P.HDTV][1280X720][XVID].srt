我是个医生  可够不到...

世界末日一样的天气  伙计们
You know, end of the world-type weather? Is this...guys?

27
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,087
偏离了航线一千英里

有声吗

00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,093
你问个不停
You keep asking if there's anything.

40

原谅我所表露出的绝望
Pardon me for appearing desperate,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,076
但在机长被拽出驾驶舱之前
but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit,

42
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,064
他确实说了没有人会找到我们
he did say that no one's gonna find us

43
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:37,002
除非我们能把无线电收发机修好
unless we get that transceiver working.

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,006
所以
So...

45
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:39,069
有声吗

好吧
Okay.

47
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,095

我对这次艰苦跋涉所做出的杰出贡献

不  我很高兴你来了  Charlie
No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.

53
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:02,009
每个旅行都需要一个懦夫
Every trek needs a coward.

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,088
你可不是懦夫
You're not a coward.

The Republican Guard.

162
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,053
好用了吗
Is it working?

163
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,074
看来行了
It seems to be,

164
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,041
就差找到信号了
except we're not picking up a signal.

165
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,058
为什么要找信号呢
Why do we need to pick up a signal?

166
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,050
我们不是要发射信号吗
Aren't we trying to send one?

167
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:38,083
是的  但要看到小格
Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars.

168
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:41,000
信号格表示无线电被接收了
The bars show it's getting reception.

169
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,029
我们需要信号格
We need the bars?

170
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,084
我们可以盲播
We could broadcast blind,

171
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:47,072
希望有人或船能收到我们的求救信号
hope that someone, maybe a ship somewhere picks up our distress call.

172
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,034
但那样可能是在浪费电池
But that would be a waste of the battery,

173
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,043
电池可不多了
which might not last for long.

174
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,031
我们还可以试一个办法
There is one thing we could try.

175
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,077
看我们是否能从高地收到信号
Get the signal from high ground.

176
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:59,010
要多高
How high?

177
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,022
他怎么样了
How is he?

178
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:39,064
有什么办法吗
Can you do anything?

179
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,064
拔出碎片
I can pull out the shrapnel.

180
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,056
可你昨天说如果要拔了出来--
But you said if you took it out...

181
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,002
我知道  但那是昨天
That was yesterday.

182
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,094
我以为他现在该在医院了
I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now.

183
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,040
如果再这样下去  他一天内就会死的
If I leave him like this he'll be dead within a day.

184
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:56,062
如果拔下来  然后止住血
If I open him up...If I can control the bleeding,

185
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,016
如果不化脓
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

186
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
如果再能找到些抗生素
and if I can find some antibiotics,

187
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,041
他也许就会没事
he might be all right.

188
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,026
我要上山了
I'm going on a hike.

189
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:14,022
什么
Sorry?

190
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,068
Sayid修好了收发机  但用不了
SSayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it.

191
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,047
在这里用不了
Not from here.

192
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,026
Kate 等一下
Kate, wait a minute.

193
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,068
是你说我们必须要发射信号的
You said we had to send a signal.

194
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:21,023
你看到了那东西把机长弄成了什么样
Look, you saw what that thing did to that pilot.

195
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:22,018
恩  看到了
Yeah, I did.

196
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,065
为什么你认为我们在这里就比在丛林里安全呢
What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?

197
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,099
等我  我不知道还要多久...
Wait for me. I don't know how long...

198
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,082
Sayid说电池不多了
Sayid said the battery won't last.

199
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:42,096
如果看到或听到什么东西
If you see or hear anything...

200
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,071
任何东西
Anything...

201
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,038
跑就是了
Run.

202
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:49,090
什么  那个
What, that?

203
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,019
什么  吃那个吗
What, eat that?

204
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,082
老兄  老兄
Dude, dude,

205
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,007
我是饿了
I'm starving.

206
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:08,078
可还不至于那么饿
But I am nowhere near that hungry.

207
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:13,000
不  不  谢谢了
No. No. No, thank you.

208
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,050
不吃  不了
No way. No.

209
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,060
是西班牙语漫画
The comic's in Spanish. You...

210
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,073
你懂西班牙语
...read Spanish?

211
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,023
不懂
No.

212
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:39,057
我找到的
I found it.

213
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,095
告诉你吧  我们回家后
Tell you what, we get home...

214
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:57,062
我再给你弄一条狗
...l'll get you another dog.

215
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,044
要你帮下忙
I need your help.

216
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,061
好
Okay.

217
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,090
帮我查看一下行李
Help me go through the luggage.

218
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,042
我需要各种处方药和药品
I need any prescription medications you find,

219
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,092
特别是以"素"和"西林"为结尾的药
especially drugs that end in "mycin" and "cillin."

220
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,020
那些是抗生素
Those are antibiotics.

221
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,054
用来干什么
What's this for?

222
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,019
你在干什么
What are you doing?

223
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,020
我想我对他太凶了
I think I was mean to him.

224
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,062
他是那个在门口的人
He's that guy from the gate.

225
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,070
不让我们坐我们头等舱座位的人
He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class.

226
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,079
他救了我们
He saved our lives.

227
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,084
来吧  Shannon 我们要清理些残骸
Shannon, we're trying to clear the wreckage.

228
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,009
你该帮帮忙
You should help out.

229
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,030
你在这儿无所事事的
You're just being worthless over here.

230
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,064
我什么
I'm being what?

231
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:34,047
你想让我怎么说
What do you want me to say?

232
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,006
你坐在那儿盯着尸体
You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.

233
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:38,006
我刚遭受了打击  知道吗
I've just been through a trauma here, okay?

234
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,056
我们都遭受了打击
We've all been through a trauma.

235
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:40,090
唯一区别就是  自从失事以来
The only difference is, since the crash,

236
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,040
你一直在进行所谓的治疗
you've actually given yourself a pedicure.

237
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,036
你知道什么  那么容易就可以取笑我  你还乐此不疲
You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it.

238
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,032
我倒希望不用浪费我的时间来... 
I wish I didn't have to waste ly time...

239
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,028
我希望没有理由  是的  很容易  Shannon
I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.

240
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,024
去你的  你根本就不知道我的想法
Screw you. You do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.

241
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,070
我要比你清楚的多
I have a much better idea than you think I do.

242
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,049
不  不是
No, you don't!

243
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:57,020
好  Shannon 那你想干什么
Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?

244
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:10,072
我要和他们一起去登山
I'm going with them on the hike.

245
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,038

对  我这就去
Yup. I'm going.

247
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,001
不  不行  Shannon
No you're not, Shannon.

248
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,072
Shannon!

249
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,022
我要和你们一起去
I'd like to come with you.

250
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,006
她不去
She's not going.

251
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:20,052
才不是
The hell I'm not!

252
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:23,006
她的糟糕决定让她的家人不快
She postures and makes really bad decisions to upset her family

253
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,036
而此时那家人就是我
which, at the moment, is me.

254
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,077
闭嘴  别耍帅了
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.

255
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,090
我和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

256
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:30,082
这不太好吧
I don't know if that's a good idea.

257
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:33,041
你怎么回事  就比我大两岁  拜托
What are you, two years older than me? Please?

258
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,043
你要去  是吧
You're going, aren't you?

259
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,083

那我去定了
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

262
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,067
谁都可以来  可现在就要出发了
Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.

263
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:46,046
别对她妄下断言  她人不错的
You couldn't tell from that, but she's really nice.

264
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,084
你决定了加入我们
You decided to join us.

265
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:35,043
我性情不定  甜心
I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

266
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,004
在找什么
What are you looking for?

267
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,079
刀片什么的
Some sort of blade.

268
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,046
你儿子怎么样了
How's your son?

269
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,038
Walt吗  恩  我想他会没事的
Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

270
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,022
他多大了
How old is he?

271
00:23:56,051 --> 00:24:00,047
九岁  十岁
Nine. Ten.

272
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,047
十岁
Ten.

273
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,089
Walt最担心的就是他的狗了
Walt's more worried about his dog than anything.

274
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,069
狗在飞机上  所以...
The dog was on the plane, so...

275
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,056
小孩子  这你也知道
Kids, you know.

276
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,097
拉布拉多尔狗吗
Is it a lab?

277
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,033
恩
Yeah.

278
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,003
是吧
Yeah?

279
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:18,020
昨天在丛林里看到过
I saw him yesterday in the jungle.

280
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,020
什么
What?

281
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,061
哪儿
Where?

282
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:22,020
那边
Over there...

283
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,037
大约几百码吧
A couple hundred yards in or so.

284
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,008
看起来还不错
He looked good.

285
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,098
是什么东西  这和跳棋一样吗
What is it, like checkers?

286
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,023
不太一样  这比跳棋更有趣
Not really. It's a better game than checkers.

287
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:09,054
你和你老爸玩跳棋吗
Do you play checkers with your pop?

288
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,075
没有
No.

289
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:13,042
我和妈妈住在澳大利亚
I live in Australia with my mom.

290
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:16,059
你没有那的口音
You have no accent.

291
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:19,009
恩  我们常搬家
Yeah, I know, we move a lot.

292
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,072
她生病了
She got sick.

293
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:24,014
几周前死了
She died a couple of weeks ago.

294

你这个月不顺哪
You're having a bad month.

295
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:30,035
我想是吧
I guess.

296

双陆棋是世界上最古老的游戏了

297
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,010
考古学家在挖掘美索不达米亚古代遗迹的时候
Archaeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins

298

300

Did they have dice and stuff?

00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,038
恩  但不是用塑料做的
But theirs weren't made of plastic.

303
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,001
他们的骰子是用骨头做的
Their dice were made of bones.

304
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,072
酷
Cool.

305
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,093
两名选手  两方
Two players. Two sides.

306
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:14,031
一白  一黑
One is light. One is dark.

00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,057
Walt
Walt...

308

想知道一个秘密吗
...do you wanna know a secret?

309
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:40,017
不  多谢
No, thank you.

310
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,009

好  谢了
Okay. Thanks.

312
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:16,012
天哪
Oh, God.

313
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,071
我感觉到了
I just felt it!

314
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,050
来  摸一下  摸一下
I just... Come here, feel this!

315
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,051
感觉到了吗
Do you feel that?

316
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,051
看  踢了
That, right there.That's a kick!

317
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,023
就这儿  脚在这儿
There, right there's a foot!

318
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:37,044
等一下  他在动
Oh, my God, wait,he's moving around.

319
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:41,032
他  他
He. He.

320
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,049
我想你是个男孩子
I guess I think you're a he.

321
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,000
好了  开阔地带
Okay. Wide open space.

322
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:58,083
你该试一下无线电  看看好用不
Check the radio, see if we're good.

323
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:00,071
在这里不会收到的
We're not gonna have reception.

324
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,059
就试试吧
Just try it.

325
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:03,009
我不想浪费电池
I don't want to waste batteries.

326
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:05,051
我没说让你一天都开着
I'm not asking to keep it on.

327
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,001
我们还是被山挡着
We're blocked by the mountain.

328
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,063
就试一下该死的无线电
Check the damn radio!

329
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:10,076
如果我试一下  到用的时候我们可能就...
We might not have any juice left when we get to...

330
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:22,057
天
Oh, my God.

331
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,036
什么鬼东西
What the hell's that?

332
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:26,036
有东西来了
Something's coming.

333
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:30,087
我看是向咱们来的
Coming towards us.

334
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,053
来吧  我们走
Come on, let's move.

335
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,054
我不该来的
I shouldn't have come on this hike!

336
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,076
Sawyer
Sawyer!

337
00:28:40,076 --> 00:28:41,096
别管他
Let him go!

338
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,045
那是...
That's...

339
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,028
那是一只大熊
That's a big bear.

340
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,058
会是它杀了机长吗
You think that's what killed the pilot?

341
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,041
不是
No.

342
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:23,071
不  它和那东西相比就是小巫见大巫了
No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.

343
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:28,026
伙计们  这不光是一只熊
Guys, this isn't just a bear.

344
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:32,076
还是一只北极熊
It's a polar bear.

345
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,078
你确定他昏过去了吗
You sure he's out?

346
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:46,028
你怎么知道你拔出来那东西的时候他不会醒
How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?

347
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:47,096
我不知道
I don't.

348
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,013
嗨 伙计 你醒了没
Hey, guy, you awake?

349
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,014
看那  救援飞机来啦  我们得救啦  好唉
Yo! There's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yay!

350
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,093
恩  他昏了
Yeah, he's out.

351
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:06,047
那你想让我...
So, what do you want me...?

352
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:08,077
他不太可能会恢复意识
It's unlikely he'll regain consciousness,

353
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,018
但可能他会因疼痛而醒来
but the pain might bring him around.

354
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,098
如果这样  你就要按住他
If it does, hold him down.

355
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:21,028
我不太善于和血打交道哦  哥们儿
Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.

356
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:23,058
那就别看
Then don't look.

357
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,083
恩  可是...
Yeah. But...

358
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:28,092
我不太善于和血打交道哦
I'm not so good around blood.

359
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,000
尽全力好了  好吗
Just do the best you can, okay?

360
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:39,018
别看
Don't look.

361
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:40,095
好
Okay.

362
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,007
老兄
Dude.

363
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,028
把止血带给我
Hand me those strips.

364
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,003
老兄
Dude.

365
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:02,095
把止血带给我  我要把血止住
Just hand me the strips. I need to get this bleeding stopped.

366
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:04,054
我看我做不来
I don't think I can.

367
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,025
怎么  怎么回事
What? What's going on?

368
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,066
把止血带给我
Just hand me the strips.

369
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:08,087
给我
Give it to me.

370
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,012
想都别想  Hurley
Don't even think about it.

371
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,096
想都别想 Hurley
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

372
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,079
该死
Damn it.

373
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:17,067
不会是北极熊吧
That can't be a polar bear.

374
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,013
是北极熊
It's a polar bear.

375
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,001
等一下
Wait a minute.

376
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,080
北极熊可不是住在丛林里的
Polar bears don't live in the jungle.

377
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,018
说的就是
Spot-on.

378
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,064
不  北极熊不会住在这么远的南部
No. Polar bears don't live this far south.

379
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,085
这只就是
This one does.

380
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:29,027
曾经是  曾经
Did. It did.

381
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,035
那东西哪来的
Where did that come from?

382
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,048
可能是熊村吧  我怎么会知道
Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?

383
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,094
不是熊  是枪
Not the bear, the gun.

384
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:40,053
在一具尸体上找到的
I got it off one of the bodies.

385
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,051
一具尸体
One of the bodies?

386
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,091
对  一具尸体
Yeah, one of the bodies.

387
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,041
飞机上不允许带枪
People don't carry guns on planes.

388
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,049
美国执行官就可以带啊  美人儿
They do if they're a U.S. Marshal, sweet cheeks.

389
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,087
飞机上就有一把
There was one on the plane.

390
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,075
我看到一个脚踝有配枪的人躺在那儿
I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster,

391
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,063
所以我就拿了枪
so I took the gun,

392
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,025
想也许用得着
thought it might come in handy.

393
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,046
看看怎么样
Guess what,

394
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,026
我刚干掉一只熊
I just shot a bear.

395
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,001
那你怎么知道他是执行官
So why do you think he's a marshal?

396
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,063
因为他有一个别针别住的警章
Because he had a clip-on badge!

397
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,068
我也拿了  觉得很酷
I took that too. Thought it was cool.

398
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,060
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

399
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,001
你是犯人
You're the prisoner.

400
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,089
你在美国执行官身上找到了一把枪
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

401
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:11,010
恩  我相信是那样
Yes, I think you did.

402
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,019
你知道位置  因为他要把你押到美国
You knew where it was because he was bringing you back to the States.

403
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,040
那些手铐是在你身上的
The handcuffs were on you.

404
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,073
所以你才知道有把枪在那儿
That's how you knew.

405
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:17,030
滚
Piss off!

406
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,090
这才是你本来面目  你个混蛋
That's who you are, you son of a bitch.

407
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:20,065
咱们互相怀疑
Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.

408
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,074
你是犯人
You are the prisoner.

409
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:23,011
行  我是罪犯
Fine, I'm the criminal.

410
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,041
你是恐怖分子
You're the terrorist.

411
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,066
我们都可以扮演个角色
We'll all play a part!

412
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:27,012
你想当什么
Who do you wanna be?

413
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,012
有谁知道怎么用枪吗
Does anybody know how to use a gun?

414
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,075
扣一下扳机就行了
I think you just pull the trigger.

415
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:36,067
别用枪
Don't use the gun.

416
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,096
我想把它卸开
I want to take it apart.

417
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:41,084
枪把下有一个钮
There's a button on the grip.

418
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,001
推一下  弹夹就会弹出来
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

419
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:46,068
枪膛里还有一发子弹
There's still a round in the chamber.

420
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:52,010
按住那钮  拉枪的上面
Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.

421
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,020
我了解你这一类型
I know your type.

422
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,099
我看不是吧
I'm not so sure.

423
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,091
恩  我和你这样的女孩子打过交道
Yeah, I've been with girls like you.

424
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:16,029
没有女孩子和我一模一样
Not girls exactly like me.

425
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,036
要给您加满吗
Can I get you a refill?

426
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:42,007
不  不用了  多谢
I'm fine with this, thank you.

427
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,007
先生  您呢  需要些什么吗
You, sir, can I get you anything?

428
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,016
鸡尾酒  汽水
Cocktail, soda?

429
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,091
就咖啡吧  甜心  黑咖啡
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

430
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:50,041
咖啡  好的
Coffee, sure.

431
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:55,046
你看起来忧心忡忡啊
You look worried.

432
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,021
我要是你也会这样
I'd be worried too, I was you.

433
00:33:58,063 --> 00:34:00,067
但你要乐观点儿  孩子
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

434
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:04,055
还是有机会他们会相信你的故事的
There's always that off-chance that they'll believe your story.

435
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,097
我知道我就相信
I know I sure do.

436
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,089
我不在乎你相不相信
I don't care what you believe.

437
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,039
这倒是真的
Oh, I know that's true.

438
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,064
一向如此
That has always been true.

439
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:19,011
你真的不再要些果汁吗
You sure you don't want some more juice?

440
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,015
恩  不要了
Yeah, I'm sure.

441
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,093
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentleman,

442
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:51,030
机长已经打开了"安全带"指示灯
the captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

443
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,056
请返回您的座位并系好安全带
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.

444
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:01,002
我求你帮个忙
I have one favor to ask.

445
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,036
真的吗
Really?

446
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,082
看来不错
This oughta be good.

447
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,069
我们该继续前进了
We should keep moving.

448
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:41,096
不
No.

449
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,051
她在哪儿
Where is she?

450
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,022
谁
Who?

451
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:14,028
现在倒想检查无线电了
Oh, now's a good time to check the radio.

452
00:37:14,036 --> 00:37:16,032
这之前干嘛去了
Not before, but now.

453
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,083
我们的地势高点儿了
We're up higher.

454
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,033
是啊  可不是吗
Yes, we are.

455
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,059
有一个信号格了
Bar. Hey, we've got a bar!

456
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:36,018
呼救  呼救
Mayday, Mayday!

457
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,014
是什么
What is that?

458
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,097
什么的反馈  什么东西会那么做
From what? What would do that?

459
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:41,072
不知道
I don't know.

460
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:42,073
我告诉你是什么东西--
I'll tell you what.

461
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,014
这家伙不是在修无线电
This guy not fixing the radio.

462
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:46,044
那东西都不好用了
The thing doesn't even work.

463
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,048
不  不  没坏
No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.

464
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:57,016
我们发送不了是因为有其他的信号已经在发送了
We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.

465
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,016
从哪儿传来的
Transmitting from where?

466
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,037
附近的某个地方  信号很强烈
Somewhere close. The signal's strong.

467
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,087
附近的某个地方
Somewhere close?

468
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:03,079
就是说在这岛上  好极了
On the island? That's great!

469
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,004
也许是其他的幸存者
Maybe it's other survivors.

470
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,033
我们飞机上的吗  他们怎么--
From our plane? How would they...

471
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,071
这是什么样的传输信号
What kind of transmission is it?

472
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,004
也许是卫星电话或无线电信号--
