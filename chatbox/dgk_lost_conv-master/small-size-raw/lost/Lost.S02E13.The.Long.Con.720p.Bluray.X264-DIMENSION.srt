1
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:07,043
-Charlie  把孩子给我  -你以为你是谁啊 John?
-Charlie. Give me the baby.  -Who the hell are you, John?

2
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:10,077
Aaron不是你该管的
Aaron's not your responsibility.

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,033
他出生的时候你在哪里?
Where were you when he was born?

4
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,040
他被抓走的时候你又在哪里?
Where were you when he was taken?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,010
你不是他爸爸  也不是他家人
You're not his father.You're not his family.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,030
你同样也不是  Charlie
Neither are you, Charlie.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,000
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,013
这个岛不是你们的 而是我们的
This is not your island.This is our island.

9
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,003
而你们之所以能生活在这里
And the only reason you're living on it

10
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:40,090
是因为我们允许你们这么做
is because we let you live on it.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,057
这里就是界线了
Right here, there's a line.

12
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:46,033
如果你们敢踏过这界线
You cross that line,

13
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:51,093
那我们之间就不仅仅只是误会了
we go from misunderstanding to something else.

14
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,000
你自己决定  Jack
It's your call, Jack.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,093
Sayid和我说你是个警察
Sayid tells me that you're a cop.

16
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:58,047
曾经是
I was a cop.

17
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:01,037
我可以请教你一些事情吗?
Can I ask you something?

18
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,010
说吧
Shoot.

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,063
你觉得训练一支军队要多久?
How long do you think it would take to train an army?

20
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,063
这是所有的了?
Is that all of them?

21
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:30,020
所有6支都在这了
All six of them.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,027
但是只有一盒子弹
Plus one box of ammo.

23
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:39,004
至少目前我们不用担心弹药会用完
At least we don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

24
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,004
Jack  很高兴你决定
Jack, I'm grateful that you decided

25
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:45,004
把所有武器都放在同一个地方
to keep them all in the same place.

26
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:47,054
这是我从Charlie那里拿来的
I had to take them from Charlie.

27
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:50,087
是藏海洛英的
His heroin stash.

28
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:53,004
我想如果他看不到这些
I figured it might have therapeutic value,

29
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,037
会对他戒毒有所帮助
if it ever came to that.

30
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:56,010
你就打算一直把毒品藏在这雕象里?
You're just gonna leave it all in the statues?

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,044
那你打算敲碎这7个圣母玛利亚?
You wanna break seven Virgin Marys,

32
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,030
你自便吧
be my guest.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,077
我很迷信的
I'm superstitious.

34
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:04,027
John

35
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:08,090
把密码告诉我
The combination.

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,034
我想你问我也许是因为
I'm gonna assume that you're asking me

37
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:17,047
你担心我会摔下悬崖
because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something,

38
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:20,040
或者你觉得只有一人能进来这里
that it's irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room,

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
是很不可靠的
rather than this being

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,097
而不会觉得这是你不信任我
an issue of trust.

41
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:32,067
这岛上有很多悬崖  John
Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.

42
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:38,040
好吧   但是我觉得我们应该达成协议  Jack
All right. But I think we should agree, Jack,

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,054
如果我们中的任何一人需要进来这里
that if either of us need to open this door,

44
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:42,020
我们都得与对方商量
we consult each other first.

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,017
没问题
Absolutely.

46
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:46,026
右转到7  左转到33  
Right seven, left 33,

47
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:48,084
再右转到18 你要把它记下来吗?
right 18.You need to write it down?

48
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,044
不用了  我记得住
No. I got it.

49
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,087
好吧
All right.

50
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,080
还有  Jack  你应该考虑下
And, Jack, you may want to consider

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,064
把药品也放在这里面
locking the medicine in here, too.

52
00:02:56,064 --> 00:03:00,080
我为什么要那么做?
Why would I need to do that?

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,077
看吧  看吧
Well, well.

54
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:08,074
这是谁要在郊区安家啦
Look who had to relocate to the suburbs.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
像个娘们似的
Ain't that just like a woman?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,047
她住着大房子 而你却只能呆在小公寓啊
She keeps the house and you get the cheap-ass apartment.

57
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:23,070
伙计  我以前觉得这些人都恨我
Man, I thought these people hated me,

58
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,004
不过现在这名头得转给你了
but I gotta hand it to you.

59
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:28,054
偷走孩子  想要把他淹死?
Stealing the baby and trying to drown it?

60
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,050
你现在成为新的孤立对象了
Now, that's a new low.

61
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,054
连Locke都要打你
You even made Locke take a swing at you.

62
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:36,080
这就好比让甘地来教训他自己的孩子
Hell, that's like getting Gandhi to beat his kids.

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,084
你是不是应该担心一下Jack?
Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack

64
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:42,004
他正在搜你的帐子
ransacking your tent right now?

65
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:46,004
什么?
What?

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,064
你到底在干什么
What the hell you think you're doing?

67
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,044
这些是你从舱里偷出来的
You stole these from the hatch.

68
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:58,070
-是你从我那偷过去的  -什么?
-You stole them from me.  -What?

69
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,044
它们是我藏起来的  我只是拿回属于我的而已
They were in my stash.I took back what was mine.

70
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:04,074
这些是属于我们的Sawyer  是属于大家的
These belong to all of us, Sawyer.To the group.

71
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:07,007
你那藏东西的地方已经没有了
You don't have a stash anymore.

72
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,077
我是认真的  医生  放下它
Doc, you don't wanna do this.

73
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:14,030
把这些药片还给我 我会当什么都没发生过
Just give me the pills, we'll forget it ever happened.

74
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,080
你在威胁我?
Are you threatening me?

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:21,087
没有下一次了  医生
Last chance, Doc.

What do you want, right now?

79
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:07,030
就要你
Just you.

80
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,054
该死
Oh, damn it.

81
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,004
怎么了
What is it?

82
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,090
我开会要迟到了 就是我和你说过的那个会议
I'm gonna be late for that meeting I told you about.

83
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,087
会议?
Meeting, huh?

84
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:26,004
是的
yeah

85
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,077
如果你还有约会 你直说就是了
You got another date,you can just say so.

86
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:32,093
我可没本事脑袋里同时想着两个女人
I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time,

87
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:34,037
但是我还是满欣赏你的宽宏大量
but I appreciate the permission.

88
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:38,050
一会就回来  美人
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

89
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:45,077
你不该看到这些
You weren't exactly supposed to see that.

90
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:50,004
你没开玩笑吧?
Are you serious?

91
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:51,004
什么?
What?

92
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,060
这不是真的吧
You're not serious?

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,094
你这么巧带了个装满现金的手提箱
You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash,

94
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:59,030
而正要去拿的时候
and you go to pick it up

95
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,097
锁恰好坏了?
and then the lock just happens to break?

96
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,047
给我
Give me that.

97
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:09,087
这都不是真的钱
It's not even real.

98
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:14,004
报纸?
Newspaper?

99
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,040
你在想方设法的骗我钱?
Are you trying to con me?

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,087
当我问你要这些钱派什么用场时
What, I ask you what all the money's for

101
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:23,030
你就编一些投资啊什么的来骗我
and you do some song and dance about an investment or something

102
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,097
然后...然后我就会傻呼呼的说"嘿  我这里还有些钱"
and then I say,"Hey, oh, I've got some money. "

103
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:30,094
看  都被你看穿了
Look, you got me.

104
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:33,020
你真行啊
Good for you.

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,010
这也没什么
No harm, no foul.

106
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,077
你应该有准备的
You should've done your homework.

107
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:43,084
和他离婚我什么都没得到
I didn't take anything from him in the divorce.

108
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:48,054
我不值得你花这么多心思
I'm not even worth your trouble.

109
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:55,014
我真是无地自容啊
Well, shame on me.

110
00:06:55,014 --> 00:07:00,077
告诉我你是怎么做的
I want you to show me what you do.

111
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:08,000
让我看看你到底是怎么做的
Show me what you do.What you really do.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,086
什么怎么做?
And what do I do?

113
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:16,050
告诉我你是怎么骗人的  Sawyer
Show me how to con people, Sawyer.

114
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,007
我喜欢你布置屋子的方式
I like what you've done with the place.

115
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,014
今天不用女仆
Maid's day off.

116
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:33,024
挪一下好吗?
You wanna move?

117
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:36,014
我听说Jack拿走了你的止痛药
Heard Jack took your painkillers.

118
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,074
是啊  我想那医生算是把我看成外人了
Guess me and the doc are on the outs.

119
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:42,017
今年又可以少寄一张圣诞卡了
One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.

120
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:45,010
这可能会让你开心一点 我从舱里拿来的
Maybe that'll cheer you up.It's from the hatch.

121
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,054
我知道你在为找不到阅读材料发愁
I know you're hard up for reading material.

122
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:53,027
就象我想知道怎么剪头发一样
Well, as much as I'd like to learn to "feather my hair,"

123
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:56,060
在竹筏上我把眼镜弄掉了
I lost my damn glasses on the raft.

124
00:07:57,028 --> 00:08:01,062
能读给我听吗?
You wanna read it to me?

125
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:05,078
怎么了  你有约会么
What, You got an appointment or something?

126
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,034
就这个了
All right.

127
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:13,065
"10种可以判断他是否是个敏感男人的方法"
 "Ten Ways To Tell If He's A Sensitive Man. "

128
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,018
听上去还不错
This ought to be good.

129
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,018
早上好
Morning.

130
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:19,058
John
Hey, John.

131
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,048
这就是个敏感男人
Now, there's a sensitive man.

132
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,088
Claire让他睡在那边
Claire asked him to sleep down here.

133
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,025
拜托
Come on.

134
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:28,042
Locke也只是为了得到他想要的
Locke's got himself needs,

135
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:33,005
就和其他所有人一样
just like anyone else.

136
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,012
不是所有人都象你一样的  Sawyer
Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.

137
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:38,038
我想这就是为什么Jack和那个Ana Lulu
Guess that's why El Jacko and Ana Lulu

138
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,098
没叫我参加他们的革命的原因吧
didn't ask me to join their revolution.

139
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:47,042
怎么  你没听说他们的小军队?
What? You didn't hear about their little army?

140
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:55,008
看来我不是唯一一个被医生看成是外人的人了
Guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the doc.

141
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:06,018
伙计
Hey, man.

142
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:11,048
你要把橙汁放在椰子里然后一起喝下去?
You gonna put the lime in the coconut,drink them both up?

143
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,005
"椰子里的橙汁"?
Lime in the coconut?

144
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,065
一首歌
The song?

145
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:20,028
你想要说什么  Hurley?
What do you want, Hurley?

146
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,062
我刚才在Rose和Bernard的帐子附近
I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent...

147
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,028
你知道他是个牙医吗?
Did you know he's a dentist?

148
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:29,038
他们还隐瞒了其它东西
Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us.

149
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,095
他还收到过Boone从那架挪威的 
He picked up Boone's signal

150
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,088
飞机上发出的求救信号
from the Norwegian plane.

151
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,012
是尼日利亚
Nigerian.

152
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:39,072
好吧  反正他是用这个接收到的
Right. Anyhow,he picked it up with this.

153
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:45,032
这是个短波收音机 是个非常不错的步话机
That is a short-wave radio.It's a glorified walkie-talkie.

154
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:48,015
是啊  那你能不能把这蓝线和红线转换一下
Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire

155
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,048
让它变得更好用些?
with a red wire and make it stronger?

156
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,092
我们试着用飞机的 无线电向外发信号
We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver

157
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,042
我们所能收到的就只有
and all we got was

158
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,045
那个法国女人16年前发出的循环信息
the French woman's message on a loop.

159
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,095
我为什么还要费劲弄这个?
Why would I bother?

160
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,032
伙计  我是说  这值得...
Come on, man. I mean, it's worth...

161
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:03,005
这没什么利用价值 只会浪费时间
It's worth nothing.It's a waste of time.

162
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:06,098
我只是想让你振作一点
I was just trying to cheer you up, dude.

163
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:09,088
我不需要
I don't need cheering up.

164
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:15,072
好吧  对不起 没什么事了
OK, man. Sorry. No problem.

165
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,005
你搞到保险门密码了?
You get the combo?

166
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,045
太棒了
Nice.

167
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:39,045
你不觉得这样就说服你那伙伴
Didn't think it'd be that easy convincing your pal to give it up.

168
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,005
这对你们来说是好事...
That's the nice thing about you people,

169
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:45,052
你们还没有太害怕
you're not scared enough.

170
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:48,018
没有太害怕?
Not scared enough?

171
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:51,075
这也是为什么不能说服大家都加入我们的原因
Same reason no one'll join the army.

172
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:56,005
这里的每个人都觉得自己很安全
Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.

173
00:10:56,005 --> 00:11:02,035
相信我  Ana  没人觉得自己安全
Trust me, Ana, no one thinks we're safe.

174
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,098
那么  Jack...
So, Jack,

175
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:11,005
密码是什么?
what's the combo?

176
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:15,068
开个玩笑而已
I was just kidding.

177
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:00,018
Vincent

178
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:04,058
你在这里干什么呀?
What are you doing out here?

179
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:28,038
我的天 还真的下雨了
Oh, man, it's really coming down.

180
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,085
快进来  小妞
Get under here, Freckles!

181
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,008
我喜欢雨
I like the rain.

182
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:35,062
是啊  我也喜欢 但是只限于里面
Yeah, me too, from under here.

183
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,022
怎么回事?
What the hell?

184
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:41,012
是Sun
It's Sun.

185
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,072
她还好吗?
Is she all right?

186
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,015
还有呼吸
She's breathing.

187
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,088
找Jack  去找Jack
Go get Jack. Go get Jack.

188
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:07,015
好的
OK.

189
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,078
发生了什么?
What happened?

190
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,038
Jack在哪里?
Where's Jack?

191
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,002
她还清醒吗?
Was she conscious at all?

192
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,092
-她说过什么吗?  -没  一句话都没说过
-Did she say anything?  -Not a word.

193
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,018
她没事了  她没事了 她很快就会好的
She's OK. She's going to be all right.

194
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:28,062
你让我来照顾她吧  拜托
You need to let me take care of her,all right? Please.

195
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:31,045
-你怎么找到她的?  -我听到她在丛林里尖叫
-How'd you find her?  -I heard her scream.

196
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,008
她的手是被绑起来的
She was out cold,and her hands were tied.

197
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:37,012
她的手为什么被绑起来?
What do you mean her hands were tied?

198
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:41,095
他们又来了
They're back.

199
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,083
他们说过不会来惹我们的
They said they would leave us alone.

200
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,080
恩  John  看来他们毁约了
They broke their promise.

201
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,047
-我们都还不知道到底怎么回事 
-We don't even know what happened.

202
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,093
 -这不是明摆着么?
 -Do we need to know?

203
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,077
你们在哪里找到她的
Where'd you find her?

204
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:02,050
就在她自己的小花园外
Just outside her garden.

205
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,037
-我们去看看  -带好枪
-We should take a look around.  -With guns.

206
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:07,033
不行
No.

207
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,017
不行?
No?

208
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,047
如果我们带着武器
We arm up,

209
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:14,012
可能会误伤自己人
we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.

210
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,050
好吧
OK.

211
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,077
我们等Sun醒过来吧 她会告诉我们发生了什么
We'll wait for Sun to wake up.She'll tell us what happened.

212
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:23,033
然后我们得有所行动
Then we're gonna do something about it.

213
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:28,057
听上去是个计划
Sounds like a plan.

214
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,073
他们通常不留痕迹
They usually don't leave any trail.

215
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:42,063
还是得去看一下的
It's worth a look.

216
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,040
我来问你些事情
Let me ask you something.

217
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,000
你想得通这一连串的事情吗?
This whole scenario make sense to you?

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,093
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

219
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,097
想一想
Think about it.

220
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,073
首先  她怎么能够逃脱的
First off, how'd she get away?

221
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:55,067
一个女人是不会有这么大的力气的
Woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds.

222
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,097
她是为她性命而挣扎
She was fighting for her life.

223
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,057
这种情况下人们什么都能做的出...
People are capable of anything...

224
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:00,087
但是你就没能逃脱
You couldn't get away.

225
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,097
你和Sun玩热油锅生死游戏的话
And you versus Sun,hot-oil death match?

226
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:05,080
我绝对把钱压你那边
My money's on you, Sheena.

227
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,097
谢谢你对我的信心
Thanks for your vote of confidence.

228
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:21,043
这是个头套  就象他们套在我头上的一样
It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.

229
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:24,033
不  这不是
No, it's not.

230
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:27,073
这个是黑色的 花纹也不一样
This one's black. Different weave.

231
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:35,007
细节说明一切  他们都错了
It's all in the details,and they're wrong.

232
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:38,070
那如果不是那些人  还会是谁呢?
Well, if it wasn't them, then who?

233
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,070
你是说是我们中的人干的?
What are you saying, one of us did it?

234
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,027
谁会想要去袭击Sun?
Who the hell would wanna go after Sun?

235
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:50,063
除非是想说服大家加入军队...
Not much upside to scaring the crap out of 46 people.

236
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:56,017
再也不会有其它吓唬全部46个人的理由了
Unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.

237
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,057
这些项链分文不值  Sawyer
Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer.

238
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:05,020
一个5岁小孩都能看出来
A five-year-old could tell that.

239
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,037
他们是不会看这项链的
They ain't gonna look at the necklaces.

240
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,067
他们只会看这标价
They're gonna look at the price.

241
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,027
细节说明一切  甜心
It's all in the details, Dimples.

242
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,033
那如果我们被抓怎么办?
What if we get caught?

243
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,027
我们不会的
We ain't gonna get caught.

244
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,010
如果有人去报警
Anybody goes to the cops,

245
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,043
他们所能记得的就是
the only thing they're gonna remember

246
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:25,030
那个男人好像在酒吧里闹过事
is a guy who looks like he's been in a bar fight.

247
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,050
你害怕了?
You're scared, huh?

248
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,080
有一点
A little bit.

249
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,040
这是个好消息  宝贝
Well, here's the good news, baby.

250
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,083
所有人都在害怕
Everybody's scared.

251
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,047
他们最害怕的就是
And the thing they're scared of most

252
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:45,053
错过机会
is missing an opportunity.

253
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,035
-他们就只有这些了  25块  
-This is all they had.

254
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,053
-让我们去街头那家
-Let's try down the street.

255
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:55,090
你们要这些项链吗?
Hey. You guys wanna buy some necklaces?

256
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,030
-哪里来的?  -还用说么
-Where'd you get them?  -What do you think?

257
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,073
你们要不要?
You want to buy them or not?

258
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:04,083
见鬼  算了
Forget it.

259
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:08,043

Hey, how much?

00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,087
100一根
Hundred a piece.

261
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,097
随便哪根都是?
For any of them?

262
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,080
是的  是的 真是明智
Yeah, yeah. Taster's choice.

下周是Dana的生日 送这个最好了
Dana's birthday's next week.

268

他们喜欢珠宝

269
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,037
500  600  700
Five, six, seven hundred.

270
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,060
脉搏跳的稳定有力
Pulse is good, strong.

271
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,000
你只要好好照看她就行了
You just need to watch her.

272
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,043
她会没事的
She's gonna be OK, man.

273
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
她额头的肿块...
That bump on her head,

274
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,060
你觉得是她摔倒造成的 还是有人打她的?
do you think she fell or that someone hit her?

275
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,097
我也不知道
I don't know.

276
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:27,007
Jack你了解Ana Lucia么?
Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia?

277
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,020
只是...
I was just...

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,033
其它人... 我当时和你都在一起
The Others... I was out there with you.

279
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,017
我听到他们说如果我们离他们远点
I heard that man say if we stayed away,

280
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,067
他们不会来惹我们的
they'd leave us alone.

281
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,057
我们已经离的他们够远的了
We've left them alone,

282
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,043
那么他们为什么要再袭击我们?
so why would they attack us a few days later?

283
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:49,093
如果不是他们 那会是谁?
If it wasn't them, then who was it?

284
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:58,073
就象我说的  你有多了解Ana Lucia?
Like I said,how well do you know Ana Lucia?

285
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,033
有些人有兴趣加入了
I got a couple more people interested in joining up.

286
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,080

那个很胖的人
The big guy

288
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,030
 就是老和Sayid和Scott在一起的那个
who lives behind Sayid, and Scott.

289
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,027
应该是Steve  Scott已经死了
You mean Steve. Scott's dead.

290
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:27,060
Scott Steve...

291
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,013
我要说的是  在发生了这事以后
The point is, after what happened,

292
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:34,053
人们总算是肯有所行动了
people are finally willing to do something.

293
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,039
你今天早上在哪里?
Where were you this morning?

在下雨期间呢
During the rainstorm.

296
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:50,033
你觉得我和Sun被抓有关系?
You think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed?

297
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,083
你为什么会有这个念头
Now, where would you get an idea like that?

298
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,023
Jack!

299
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:57,090
Jack...

300
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,043
Sun醒了
Sun's awake.

301
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,060
你的头怎么样?
How's your head?

302
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,060
还疼吗?  晕吗?
Any pain? Dizziness?

303
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,030
还有点儿
Just a little bit.

304
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,023
还记得什么吗?
Do you remember anything?

305
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:22,013
Vincent出现时我正在花园里忙活
I was working in my garden, when Vincent ran up.

306
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,097
接着就下雨了
It started raining,

307
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,007
然后有人用袋子套住我的头
then there was a bag over my head,

308
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,053
把我拖走了
and I was being dragged.

309
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,027
-他们有多少人?  -我...
-How many were there?  -I don't...

310
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:34,000
我什么也没看见
I didn't see anything

311
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:38,020
我拼命反抗
I kicked and I fought,

312
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,030
玩儿命的跑
and I just ran as fast as I could.

313
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,030
然后我摔倒了...
And then I fell...

314
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,007
枪
Gun.

315
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:10,063
怎么了
Hey. What's going on?

316
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:13,000
看来岛上的这些人
Looks like the good folks of Islandtown are about to form a posse,

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,080
要准备全副武装了
get themselves armed up.

318
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,037
早料到了
I wouldn't be surprised

319
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,077
要是Jack没有叫你
if Jack didn't find that horse of yours,

320
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:26,047
他就成了名正言顺的领导者了
start leading the charge in a big white hat.

321
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,023
枪
The guns.

322
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:41,047
这都是她搞的鬼  就是为了得到枪
This is all her play to get her hands on the guns.

323
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:45,060
Locke  你得去告诉他  他们要来了
Locke. You need to go and tell him they're coming.

324
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,077
要我去?
I need to tell him?

325
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:52,060
Sawyer  求你了
Sawyer, please.

326
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:58,023
然后呢?
So, what's next?

327
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,033
然后?
Next?

328
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:02,080
下一步呢?
The next play.

329
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,017
我来教你怎么骗
I'll show you the pigeon drop.

330
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:08,017
我们已经两次得手了
We already did that. Twice.

331
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:11,083
还有塔尔萨州的那次和鲁克的牌局
And the Tulsa bag scam,and the Looky-loo.

332
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,097
我想干场大的
I wanna do a big one.

333
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:16,080
你想干场什么大的?
You wanna do a big what?

334
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,060
大的骗局
A big con.

335
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,063
那叫放长线吊大鱼
It's called a long con.

336
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,090
好吧  放长线吊大鱼
OK, a long con.

337
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,087
怎么做?
How does it work?

338
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:30,000
你得让你的猎物求你做事
It works by getting someone to ask you

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,007
让整件事看起来像他们的主意
to do something like it's their idea,

340
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,057
你才是幕后操纵者
Your idea

341
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:36,077
不过这都没关系
But none of that matters,

342
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:40,026
因为要做这一切只需要一样东西 
'cause the one thing you need for a long con,

343
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,013
而我们没有...
we ain't got.

344
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:43,030
钱
Money.

345
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,090
我有钱
I have money.

346
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,041
听着  Cassie  
Sorry, Cassie. 40

347
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,070
共有帐户上的4万块根本不够
 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.

348
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,000
还记得我跟你说过
Remember when I told you that

349
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,010
我离婚时没拿到钱吗?
I didn't get anything from the divorce?

350
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,050
我没说实话
I kind of lied.

351
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,023
有多少没说?
You kind of lied how much?

352
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:06,063
60万美元
600 grand.

353
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,093
见鬼  乖乖 有那么多钱
Hell, with that kind of money,

354
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:10,037
咱们都可以去找个小岛  在沙滩上晒晒太阳
let's go find an island somewhere

355
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,053
喝个烂醉如泥
and sit on the beach drinking mojitos till we go toes up.

356
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:16,050
Sawyer  我一生中第一次
Sawyer, for the first time in my life

357
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,073
真的觉得快活
I'm actually happy.

358
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:24,013
而这并不是因为我们干的事或是得到的钱
And it's not really about the action or the money.

359
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:27,063
而是因为和你一起做这些事
It's about doing this with you.

360
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:29,057
来吧
Come on.

361
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:34,073
吊一次大鱼
One long con.

362
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:39,057
然后就去快活吧
And then the mojitos.

363
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,093
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

364
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:50,020
到这里来考虑如何?
Why don't you think about it in here?

365
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,086
抱歉打扰你了
Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doing.

366
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:06,020
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

367
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,016
我在按字母排序
I'm alphabetizing.

368
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:12,016
对啊  Sun在丛林里被袭击了
Oh, sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle

369
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,016
你倒在这里
and you figure it's a good time

370
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:16,050
搞你的杜威十进制系统 真厉害
to start the Dewey decimal system.Good thinking.

371
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,040
有事吗  James?
How can I help you, James?

372
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,016
事实上  John  我是来帮你的
Well, actually, John, I'm here

373
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:24,033
我是来给你报信的
to help you, give you the heads up.

374
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,003
报信?
Heads up?

375
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,070
看来Jack正在来这儿的路上
Jack's on his way over to open your little gun closet

376
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,046
要打开你的小枪柜  拿他想要的东西
and take whatever he needs.

377
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:33,090
还不止他一个人这样
You should know he's not alone.

378
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,050
所有人都为那个韩国妞的遭遇震惊了
Whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose.

379
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,016
我猜每个人都想逞一逞英雄
I'm guessing everybody's gonna wanna play cowboys and Indians.

380
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:44,070
而一旦那些枪被拿出来
And once those guns are out and about,

381
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:50,023
我看是很难再把它们放回来了
something tells me they ain't never going back in.

382
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:57,016
你干嘛告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me this?

383
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,096
因为这是整Jack最好的方法
Because it'll piss off Jack.

384
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:04,053
我要是你
But if I were you,

385
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:08,056
我会马上改一下密码
I'd change that combination pronto.

386
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:12,043
可那没用  那只会让他缓缓
But that won't work.The door will just slow him down.

387
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:16,096
Jack想进来就一定进得来
If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in.

388
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:20,056
能帮帮我么?
Will you help me?

389
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:22,076
帮什么?
Help you what?

390
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:26,050
把枪藏起来
Move the guns.

391
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:29,096
藏到哪?
Move them where?

392
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:32,016
好吧  你不相信我?那祝你好运吧
Fine. You don't wanna trust me,lots of luck.

393
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:34,083
可这里不能没人守着
But I can't leave the hatch unmanned.

394
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:38,030
好吧
Sure.

395
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,000
你去藏枪  我在这里呆着
You move the guns,

396
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,046
再帮你按那该死的按键
and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.

397
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:45,016
他们还要多久才来?
How long till they get here?

398
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:51,046
那就与我无关了 你看着办吧
Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours.

399
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,000
牛肉三明治...
Steak sandwich.

400
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,044
两瓶啤酒
Two beers.

401
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:10,054
谢谢
Thank you.

402
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:13,007
给我来瓶啤酒吧
Aw, shucks.You got a beer for me?

403
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:16,000
你也要么?  找服务员吧
You want one, ask the lady.

404
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,050
好吧  真见鬼 给我来一瓶
Ha! Well, hell, I do want one.

405
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,054
再给我来一盘鸡肉沙拉 只要鸡胸脯肉
And could I get a plate of chicken salad, white meat only,

406
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:23,046
对了  不要芹菜 
and please, God,

407
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:25,000
千万别放哦  行么  亲爱的?
 no celery,OK, sweetheart?

408
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,064
我们这里就是这样做的  亲爱的
That's how we make it here, darlin'.

409
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:31,034
那么...
So,

410
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:35,037
你搞定她了吧
tell me you got her.

411
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,017
是的  搞定了
Yeah, I got her.

412
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:41,064
60万都到手了?
All 600 grand?

413
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:46,044
到手了
All six.

414
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,057
你爱上她了
You fell for her.

415
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,024
噢  算了吧别开玩笑了
You gotta be kidding me.

416
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,070
-听着  这没什么...  -是我找到那个妞的
-Look, It's got nothing...  -I found that bitch.

417
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,074
她叫Cassidy 我等着你跟她纠缠了六个月
Her name is Cassidy.I waited six months while you played house.

418
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,079
告诉你  我是不会中途撒手不管的...
I ain't doing it.

419
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,074
知道什么让你现在这么蠢么?
You know what's making you stupid?

420
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:05,024
是你该死的男性荷尔蒙
It's your damn hormones.

421
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,094
你以为你沉浸在爱情中了 可实际不是那样
You think you're in love,but you're not.

422
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,074
老虎斑纹是不会变的  James
A tiger doesn't change his stripes, James.

423
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:13,060
你是个骗子  跟我一样
You're a con man, just like me.

424
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,020
不管你做什么  这都不会改变
And it's not what you do,it's what you are.

425
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,074
明白么?
Do I make myself clear?

426
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:23,024
对不起  我下不了手
I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.

427
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,034
不  你必须得干
No, you're gonna do it.

428
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:29,034
因为那女的... 根本不了解你
Because that girl, she doesn't know you one bit.

429
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:32,004
但如果她知道你是谁
But when she finds out who you are,

430
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:34,000
你的真实身份
who you really are,

431
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,037
她会恨死你的
she's gonna hate your guts.

432
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,060
好好吃你的鸡肉沙拉吧  Gordy
Enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.

433
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,004
等等  别想现在就走
Wait a minute. You don't walk away now.

434
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,074
你欠我的
You owe me.

435
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:55,000
你想赖帐么?
You don't wanna pay me?

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,004
我会让你好看的  James...
I'll put one in your ear, James.

437
00:27:57,004 --> 00:28:02,030
你和你的妞Cassidy
You and your little friend Cassidy.

438
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:26,000
你在这里干嘛?
What are you doing here?

439
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:31,017
就要拿到游戏的高分了
I'm like this close to the high score on Donkey Kong.

440
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:44,014
说吧  要我做什么?
Now, what can I do you for?

441
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,064
Locke在哪?
Where's Locke?

442
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:47,014
不知道
I don't know.

443
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:51,077
他好像说去商店买包烟来着
I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.

444
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:12,017
看来 咱们当中有小偷了
Uh-oh.Looks like we got ourselves a theft.

445
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,024
谁来报警?  枪在哪?
Who's gonna call the cops?here are they?

446
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:19,040
别看我  我只按了个按钮
Don't look at me.I was just pushing the button.

447
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:23,087
对了  我想这些是你的吧
Oh, yeah. I believe these are yours.

448
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,040
不
No.

449
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,060
John... 枪在哪?
John. Where are they?

450
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,000
你把枪藏在哪了?
You move the guns, Where are they?

451
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,060
我们有协议的
We had an agreement!

452
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,097
是有协议  但Jack  你刚刚违反了
An agreement you were about to violate.

453
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,040
是  我是把枪藏起来了
Yes, I moved the guns.

454
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,020
藏哪里了?
Where?

455
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,050
哪里?
Where?

456
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,077
John  藏在哪里了?
Where, John?

457
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:19,084
你准备把它们交出来么?
Are you going to start handing them out?

458
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:24,024
有多少?  在谁手上?
How many? Who gets them?

459
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,097
事故总是一桩接着一桩
How much time before there's an accident? Another accident?

460
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,074
教Michael开枪是我犯的错误
I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot,

461
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:34,007
那他现在...
and now he's...

462
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:35,047
我看凶多吉少
He could be dead for all I know,

463
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:37,090
那...那是我的错
and that was my fault.

464
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,090
我承认  我负责  所以
Yes, I take responsibility for that, so

465
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,077
我会对枪的事情负责的
I'm taking responsibility for the guns, too.

466
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:44,033
-John  我需要两把枪  
-I want two guns.

467
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,090
-抱歉  Jack  事情只能
-That's the way it's gonna be, Jack.

468
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:51,070
两把枪 快告诉我它们现在在哪?
Tell me where they are right now!

469
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:02,090
你把枪给了他?
You gave him the guns?

470
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,057
不  我把枪藏起来了
No, I hid them.

471
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:10,020
没错  Jack 他和你一样蠢
That's right, Jack.He's as stupid as you are.

472
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,074
你们两都忙着猜忌对方
You were so busy worrying about each

473
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:17,007
你们都没有注意过我吧
other, you never even saw me coming.

474
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,010
你们给我听好了
So, how about you listen up?

475
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:28,050
我只说一次
Because I'm only gonna say this once.

476
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,027
你翻我的东西
You took my stuff.

477
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:34,067
趁我为大家寻找救兵的时候
While I was off trying to get us help,

478
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:37,050
为了救大家
get us rescued,

479
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,034
你拿走了我的包
you found my stash, and you took it,

480
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,014
分了我的东西
divied it up.

481
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:47,080
剃须沫  电池  甚至啤酒
My shaving cream, my batteries,even my beer.

482
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:51,004
接着呢
And then something else happened.

483
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:53,050
你让这两个家伙
You decided these two boys were gonna

484
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,084
来发号施令
tell you what to do and when to do it.

485
00:31:55,084 --> 00:32:01,024
我可不想再任人摆布了
Well, I'm done taking orders.

486
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:06,074
我也不想要回我的东西了
And I don't want my stuff back.

487
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:08,094
剃须沫无所谓
Shaving cream don't matter.

488
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,080
电池也无所谓
Batteries don't matter.

489
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,060
但现在唯一重要的就是
Only thing that matters now

490
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,040
那些枪
are guns.

491
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,087
如果你们也想要一支的话
And if you want one, you're gonna

492
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:26,047
就来我这儿拿
have to come to me to get it.

493
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:30,040
你想拷打我了  是吧
Oh, you wanna torture me, don't you?

494
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,067
让大家看看你是多么的文明吧
Show everybody how civilized you are.

495
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:38,064
来啊
Go ahead,

496
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:42,050
但是我死也不会把枪给你们的
but I'll die before I give them back.

497
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,094
那时你们就真的无计可施了  不是么?
And then you'll really be screwed,won't you?

498
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:57,097
伙计们  现在我是这里的头儿了
There's a new sheriff in town, boys.

499
00:32:57,097 --> 00:33:03,054
你们最好习惯一下
Y'all best get used to it.

500
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:25,074
怎么了?  你去哪儿了?
What's going on? Where were you?

501
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:29,050
Sawyer  怎么了?
Sawyer, what happened?

502
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,074
-看见那辆黑色轿车了么?  -是谁?
-See that black car?  -Who is it?

503
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:35,057
-他叫Gordy...我的同伙  -什么同伙?
-His name's Gordy. My partner.  -What partner?

504
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,004
如果两分钟内我不带着那个箱子
If I don't walk out with that briefcase

505
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:40,044
从前门出去  我们俩都死定了
in two minutes, we're both dead.

506
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:42,087
怎么了?  那就是跟你做生意的家伙?
That's the guy from the Mercado deal?

507
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,014
根本没有什么生意
There is no Mercado deal!

508
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:50,017
我早知道你有60万
I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get-go.

509
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:53,070
Cass...
Cass...

510
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:58,064
你就是我们的大鱼
You were the long con.

511
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,010
你这混蛋...
Son of a bitch.

512
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,024
你去死吧  去死
Go to hell. Go to hell.

513
00:34:05,097 --> 00:34:10,014
过去六个月里我们之间发生的一切
Everything that's happened between us in the past six months,

514
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,054
都是真的
all of it, that was real.

515
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,080
滚  你给我滚
Get out. You get out!

516
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,057
待会儿你想怎么恨我就怎么恨我
You can hate me all you want later,

517
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,037
可现在你得听我的
but right now you gotta listen to me.

518
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:26,050
他会杀了我们的
He is goona to kill us.

519
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:32,060
因为我说我不会拿你的钱
'Cause I told him I wasn't gonna take your money.

520
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,044
天哪
Oh, my God.

521
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:38,070
听着  现在我们得...
Look... Now we...

522
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,077
好吧
OK.

523
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,094
我们接下来应该这么做...
This is what we're gonna do.

524
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:44,094
我要你从后门走  穿过Evan的院子
Go out back through Evan's yard.

525
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:47,040
我租了辆车停在那门口
There's a rental car parked out front.

526
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,044
去苏族市
Go to Su city.

527
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:53,074
去赛奇花汽车旅馆
I want you to check in to the Sage Flower Motel.

528
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:56,044
就在29号公路旁
It's off Highway 29.

529
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:59,094
看看电视  喝点东西
Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me.

530
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:03,070
等着我  我早上就到
I'll be there in the a. m.

531
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,027
-那时一切就结束了  -让我稍微收拾下...
-It'll all be over.  -Let me just pack a few...

532
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:08,083
没时间了
There's no time.

533
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:14,004
记得你说过除了我你别无所求么?
You remember when you said I was all you ever wanted?

534
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:19,014
现在你该体会更深了
Well, now you know better.

535
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,037
我爱你
I love you.

536
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:31,000
我也爱你
I love you, too.

537
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:36,077
快  快
Go. Go.

538
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:51,044
你怎么做到的?
How'd you do it?

539
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:53,080
做什么?
How'd I do what?

540
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,070
Locke说他让你留守
Locke said that he left you in the hatch

541
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,024
他自己去藏枪的
when he went to hide the guns,

542
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:04,047
而且谁都知道你根本不懂追踪
and we both know you can't track worth a damn.

543
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:08,080
那么  你是怎么弄到手的?
So how'd you get them?

544
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,004
魔术师永远不会揭自己的底的
Magician never tells his secrets.

545
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,007
你耍我们
You played us.

546
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,046
你还耍了我
You played me.

547
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:21,053
你说的关于Ana Lucia的一切也是假的...
All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia.

548
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,036
你早知道我会去找Jack
You knew I would go to Jack.

549
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:25,093
你也知道我会叫你去找Locke
And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.

550
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:32,056
我怎么可能知道那么多
Now how in the world would I know all that?

551
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,086
你有没有对Sun下手?
Did you have anything to do with Sun?

552
00:36:34,086 --> 00:36:39,053
你把我当成什么人了?
What kind of person do you think I am?

553
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:42,029
我把你当成什么人?
What kind of a person do I think you are?

554
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:46,026
我看这和枪无关
I don't think this has anything to do with guns,

555
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:48,089
也和找回你的东西无关
or with getting your stash back.

556
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:53,069
我看你就是想让人们都恨你
I think you want people to hate you.

557
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,063
还好你不讨厌我  小妞
Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.

558
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:12,089
你干嘛非得这么做?
Why do you have to do this?

559
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:17,033
道高一尺魔高一丈
You run, I con.

560
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:22,023
老虎斑纹是不会变的
A tiger don't change her stripes.

561
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:50,026
瞧啊
Hey, check this out.

562
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:51,096
我在一个箱子里面找到了这份手稿
I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases.

563
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:53,083
像是一本推理小说
It's like a mystery book.

564
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:57,099
给你看个东西
I want to show you something.

565
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,063
真酷  你把它修好了
Cool. You fixed it.

566
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:01,079
看看吧
We'll see.

567
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,013
把这个拿着
Hold onto this.

568
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:06,076
别抱太大希望
Don't expect anything.

569
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:12,043
最多也只能收到很微弱的信号
The chances of getting a signal are slim at best.

570
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,059
有噪音就是有戏咯?
Static's good, right?

571
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:27,009
不  说明接收没问题
No. Reception is good.

572
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:29,056
听  这是什么?
What's that?

573
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,083
是Rousseau的信号
It's Rousseau's signal.

574
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,049
该死
Oh, crap.

575
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:37,039
但这个无线电的带宽不错
But this radio has a wider bandwidth.

576
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:40,019
等等  听到了么?
Oh, wait. Stop. Do you hear that?

577
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,026
那是...
That was...

578
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:45,006
只是...
Just A-Settin'...

579
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,036
与Cootie同台演出...喇叭...
...Duke Ellington Orchestra,featuring Cootie... the trumpet.

580
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,003
接下来是...
Up next on WXR,

581
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:59,039
格伦米勒管弦乐队演奏月光小夜曲...
the Glenn Miller Orchestra with Moonlight Serenade.

582
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:10,043
听啊  多清晰呀
Whoa.You hear how clear that is?

583
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,093
信号很近  对吧?
That's gotta be close, right?

584
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:14,045
这个波段的无线电信号 
Radi1o waves at this frequency

585
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:17,043
是从大气层电离层反射回来的
bounce off the ionosphere.

586
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:20,026
可以传几千英里
They can travel thousands of miles.

587
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:26,063
这个信号可能来自任何地方
It could be coming from anywhere.

588
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:32,079
或发自任何时间
Or any time.

589
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:39,053
开个玩笑
Just kidding, dude.

590
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:16,039
他没注意到你跟踪他  对吧
He never saw you, huh?

591
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,086
没有  他只关心他的破枪
No. He was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.

592
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:23,019
根本发现不了
Figured you'd want your friends back.

593
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,053
我想你需要拿回这个  对吧
If I wanted them,

594
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,056
如果我要的话  早就拿了
I would've taken them before

595
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,079
用不着告诉你他们在哪儿
I told you where they were.

596
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,049
我不是为了这个才这样做的
That's not why I did it.

597
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:40,006
不是么?
It's not, huh?

598
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:43,063
我就是想让他难堪
I wanted him to look like a fool.

599
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:46,056
就是想耍耍他
To feel like a fool.

600
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:49,013
好吧  好吧
Well, well.

601
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:53,006
看来Johnny Locke是作茧自缚了
Looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.

602
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:58,059
Sun永远也不知道我对她做了什么
Sun can never find out what I did to her.

603
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,003
永远
Never.

604
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,083
别瞎担心了
Don't sweat it.

605
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:09,086
他们现在有更重要的事情要关心
They got bigger things to worry about now.

606
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:14,056
Sawyer...

607
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:18,046
这个主意...
This idea,

608
