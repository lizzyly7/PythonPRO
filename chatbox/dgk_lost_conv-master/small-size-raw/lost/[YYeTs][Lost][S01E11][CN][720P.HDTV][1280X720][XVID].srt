3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,061
我想...我想我没事了
I think...I think I'm all right.

4
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,013
我告诉过你我会照顾好你的
I told you I'd take care of you.

5
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:26,039
-谢谢你  Charlie  -你太客气了
-Thanks,Charlie.  -You're quite welcome.

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,055
-听我说  -Sayid!
-Listen to me.  -Sayid!

7
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:30,071
岛上不只我们这些人
We're not alone.

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:34,009
我在睡觉  刚醒来
I was sleeping,and I woke up,and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,035
他正要伤害我的孩子
he was trying to hurt my baby.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,079
我们得查明每个人的身份
We gotta find out who everyone is.

11
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:38,099
你想人口调查
You want to start a census.

12
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,012
-Lance!  -什么?
-Lance!  -Sorry?

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,016
你叫Lance  对吧?
Your name's Lance,right?

14
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,085
-Ethan  -老兄  你说得对!
-Ethan.  -Dude,that's right.

15
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,011
我要你服这些药
I want you to take these.

16
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:45,064
这些是非常温和的镇静剂
They're sedatives,very mild.

17
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,067
你认为这些都是我编造出来的?
You think I'm making this up?

18
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:50,025
海边要安全点  这儿不够安全
It was safe at the beach. It's not safe here.

19
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,039
你对她说什么了?
What did you say to her?

20
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,099
发现个问题  有关人口调查的
We got a problem. The census.

21
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,011
我会见了每个人
I interviewed everyone.

22
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,074
其中一位并不在旅客名单上
One of them isn't in the manifest.

23
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,006
他没在飞机上
He wasn't on the plane.

24
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,014
-他不在飞机上  -谁不在飞机上?
-He wasn't on the plane.  -Who wasn't on the plane?

25
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,073
Ethan  那个来自加拿大的家伙  他不在旅客名单之列
Ethan,the Canadian guy. He's not on the passenger manifest.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,099
-那他在哪?  -我不知道
-Where the hell is he?  -I don't know.

27
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,022
-我昨天还看见过他  -有人看见Ethan了吗?
-I saw him yesterday... -Has anyone seen Ethan?

28
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:16,027
是的  他去砍柴了  在去海边的路上
Yeah,yeah,he went to get some wood. Took off on the path to the beach.

29
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,032
他没事吧?  发生什么事了?
Is he okay? What happened?

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,020
-Charlie在哪儿?  -什么?
-Where's Charlie?  -What?

31
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,059
Charlie在哪?
Where's Charlie?

32
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,079
他去追Claire了
He went after Claire.

33
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:41,060
Jack!

34
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,071
她正要搬回到海边去住
She was moving back to the beach.

35
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,029
Claire...是她的东西
Claire...that's hers.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,063
发生什么事了?  他们去哪了?
What happened? Where are they?

37
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,078
我不知道
I don't know.

38
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,048
脚印
Footprints.

39
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,053
这地方至少有三种不同的脚印
At least three distinct sets all over the place.

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,060
看起来像是有过争斗
It looks like there might have been a struggle.

41
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,061
什么?  又有什么?
What? What is it?

42
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,012
这儿有拖痕...
Drag marks here...

43
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,035
这儿也有
and here.

44
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:17,076
Claire和Charlie...
Claire and Charlie...

45
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,037
他们在一起
they were together.

46
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:22,055
我想他们被挟持走了
I think they've been taken.

47
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,097
-Charlie!  -Jack

48
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,047
嘘...
Shh.

49
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,039
这些痕迹是刚弄上去的
The tracks are still fresh.

50
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:00,052
这一点儿都不合理
This doesn't make any sense.

51
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,069
一个人怎么拖得动两个  其中一个还是怀孕的?
How could one man drag off two people,one of them pregnant?

52
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:07,000
你问错问题了  不是怎么拖  而是为什么?
You're asking the wrong question. Not how,why?

53
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,014
你认为是Ethan干的?
You think it was Ethan?

54
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,080
感觉当然是Ethan  难道不是吗?
Certainly feels like it was Ethan,doesn't it?

55
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,005
靠他一个人?  怎么拖?
By himself? How?

56
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,056
我们无法解释我们中的所有人
We can't account for all of our people.

57
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:17,095
更重要的是  谁说他们是我们的人了?
And more importantly,who's to say they're even our people?

58
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,075
Sayid说还有其他人
Sayid said there were others.

59
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,094
-Sayid只说我们并不孤独  -他就这个意思
-Sayid said that we're not alone.  -Semantics.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,086
Sayid受伤了  我们甚至不知道他去过哪  他现在神智不清
Sayid's injured. We don't even know where he went. He's delirious.

61
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,043
我只是在告诉你地面给我的一些暗示
I'm just telling you what the ground is telling me.

62
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,039
那地面告诉你他们往哪条路走了?
So which way is the ground telling you that they went?

63
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,049
Jack  我们不知道这儿发生过什么事
Jack,we don't know what's going on here.

64
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:33,054
我们知道得够多了
We know enough.

65
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:36,047
我们需要准备准备  10分钟内我们就能回到山洞
We need to prepare. We could be back at the caves in 10 minutes,

66
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:39,021
-组织搜索队...  -他们朝哪边走了  Locke?
-organize a search party...  -Which way did they go,Locke?

67
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,042
斯达数下降
Stats are dropping.

68
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,001
血压下降  她在不停的流血
B.P.'S falling. She's bleeding out.

69
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,065
不  我已经止住动脉的血了
No,I've got the artery almost there.

70
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,044
心脏停止跳动
She's in arrest.

71
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,035
一毫克EPI  把电击车推过来
One milligram epi. Let's get the crash cart over here!

72
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,051
好的  动脉缝合了  继续缝合
All right,artery's sealed. Close her up.

73
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,021
电击板
Defib.

74
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,067
-充电?  -充电完毕
-Charged?  -Charged.

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,039
开始
Clear.

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,089
-充电?  -充电完毕
-Charged?  -We're charged.

77
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,062
开始
Clear.

78
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:26,051

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,032
行了  Jack
Call it,Jack.

90
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,098
结束了  停止吧
It's over. Call it.

91
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,080
算你行
You call it.

92
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:25,076
你让他一个人去找?
You let him go alone?

93
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,017
别担心  我会赶上他的
Don't worry,I'll catch up.

94
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,097
海边的人有什么消息吗?
What's the word from the beach?

95
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:33,052
没有  没人看到过他
Nothing. Nobody has seen him.

96
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,033
-我和你一起去  -我就知道你会的
-I'm coming with you.  -I figured you might.

97
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,085
我们取水后得回到海边去
We need to get our water and get back to the beach.

98
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,093
听说你在组织一支搜索队  我能帮上什么忙吗?
I heard you're forming a search party. Can I help?

99
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,035
这是个荒岛
This is a deserted island.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,019
没直升机  没报警系统
There's no choppers,no amber alerts.

101
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,092
你说你怎么找他们?
How exactly are you gonna find them?

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,061
跟踪Ethan的足迹
By following Ethan's trail.

103
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,077
没人能够不留痕迹的穿越这片荒野
No one can walk through the wilderness without leaving signs...

104
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,064
草的弯曲  折断的树枝
bending blades of grass,breaking twigs...

105
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,013
尤其是还拖着两个家伙
especially with captives in tow.

106
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:01,059
还有  如果你肯来的话我还能多个帮手
And yes,I could use another hand if you're up for it.

107
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,043
那么我们出发吧
Then let's get moving.

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,081
我可以带着Vincent一块去
I could take Vincent,

109
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,032
他能够嗅出属于Charlie的东西
and he can sniff something that belonged to Charlie,

110
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,033
我帮得上忙
and I can help.

111
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:15,048
我说过不行  小子
I said no,man.

112
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,049
Locke

113
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,086
听着  你知道大伙都不愿干坐着等消息
hey,look,you know,a lot us don't just wanna sit here waiting for news.

114
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:22,091
谢谢  但我们人手够了  再多个人只会减慢搜寻速度
Thanks,but we're set. Anyone else is just gonna slow us down.

115
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,030
或许我能再组织一支搜寻队
Maybe I'll just put together another party.

116
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,010
好主意
Good idea.

117
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,052
我们去北边找  我建议你去南边
We're going North. I suggest you go South.

118
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,057
我们走
Come on.

119
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,079
我从没想过会看到这一天  Jack
Never thought I'd see the day,Jack.

120
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:40,028
你闯进我的手术室  给我的病人动手术
You barge into my O.R. You work on my patient.

121
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,078
你不必接这个急诊的
You didn't have to do this procedure.

122
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,040
我什么都不必做
I don't have to do anything.

123
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,032
是  你当然不必
Yeah,of course you don't.

124
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,094
我接手做这个手术
I chose to do this procedure...

125
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:52,011
这个紧急手术
this emergency procedure...

126
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,020
是因为女孩被送到急诊室的时候  他们打电话给我
because when this girl crashed in the E.R.,they called me.

127
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,018
我就在楼上
I was right upstairs.

128
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,060
你应该在楼上的  你怎么知道这些的?
You should have stayed upstairs. And how did you find out?

129
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,021
有个护士过来告诉我的
One of the nurses came to get me.

130
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,007
谁?
Who?

131
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:11,009
感谢上帝  有你和某个匿名的护士救我
Oh,thank god I have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me.

132
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,014
她告诉我你的手在发抖
She told me that your hands were shaking.

133
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,060
-我的手没...  -你切断了她的肝动脉
-My hands were not...  -You cut her hepatic artery.

134
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,063
她被车撞了  Jack  她的身体内部一团糟
She was in a car crash,Jack. Her insides were a mess.

135
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,025
-你犯了个错误  -他们打电话给我的
-You made a mistake.  -They called me.

136
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,050
我才不管他们是否打电话给你
I don't care whether or not they called you,

137
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,023
-你犯了个错误  -你在对我说教?
-you made a mistake.  -Are you lecturing me?

138
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:29,024
如果你在楼上  而我在饭店吃午饭
If you were upstairs,and I was in a restaurant having lunch,

139
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,093
那他们为什么要打电话给我?
then why did they call me?

140
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,076
你中午喝了多少酒  爸爸?
How many drinks did you have at lunch,dad?

141
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,019
Jack!

142
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,067
幸好你在原地找
It's a good thing you were going in a circle.

143
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:00,061
没到更大的范围去
Not much of a search grid,but

144
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:02,062
否则我们怎么都找不到你了
we never would have found ya otherwise.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,007
有什么发现吗?
Did you find anything?

146
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,035
你应该回到山洞去  Sayid的腿有伤
You should go back to the caves...Sayid's leg.

147
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,082
我给Sayid的腿敷过药了
I dressed Sayid's leg.

148
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,040
你找得到我  我们也能找到Charlie和Claire
You found me. We can find Charlie and Claire.

149
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,086
我们还有没有足迹可以跟踪?
Now,do we have a trail to follow or not?

150
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:20,018
-Jack  这都是我的错  -什么?
-Jack,this was my fault.  -What?

151
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,088
我和Ethan一块儿打猎  我和他度过了很长时间
I hunted with Ethan,I spent time with him.

152
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:24,089
我什么都没察觉出来
I never sensed anything...off.

153
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:27,065
但就我对打猎和跟踪的了解
But for everything that I know about hunting and tracking,

154
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,057
不管这人是谁  他知道得很多
whoever he is,he knows more.

155
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:31,021
如果我们追上他了
If we catch up with him,

156
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,078
我不想岛上唯一一个训练有素的医生发生什么意外
I don't want anything to happen to the only trained physician on the island.

157
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,059
所以还是回去当好医生吧  让我去找他
So go back,be the doctor. Let me be the hunter.

158
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,026
我们可以走了吗?
Can we go now?

159
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,044
跟着我
Follow me.

160
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,074
我尽力想帮忙  那家伙却叫我去南边?
I'm trying to help,and all the guy can tell me is go South?

161
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,011
什么话嘛?  我碍着他们了还是怎么了?
Like what? I'm gonna get in his way or something?

162
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,028
我们都很焦急  老兄
We're all tweaked,man.

163
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,084
Locke也和其他人一样
Locke's just feeling it like the rest of us.

164
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,080
那又怎样?
So what?

165
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:06,022
那儿有五个家伙会和我一块儿去
I got five guys who are going out there with me,

166
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,021
就算冒着生命危险  我们也想去找Charlie和Claire
putting our necks on the line to try to find Charlie and Claire.

167
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:11,019
我想说的是
All I'm saying is

168
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:14,012
我讨厌在这儿被当成二等公民
I'm getting sick of being treated like a second-class citizen around here

169
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,042
就因为那秃头能抓野猪
because Mount Baldy can bag a boar.

170
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,006
除了抓野猪  他还知道很多
He knows a lot more than how to catch a boar.

171
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,078
Locke先生是个勇士
Mr. Locke's a warrior...

172
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,060
他能打猎
he can hunt,

173
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:24,062
他能跟踪  他是这儿唯一一个带刀子的人
he can track stuff,and he's the only one who brought knives.

174
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,088
所以如果是我  我就会听他的
So if it were me,I'd listen to him.

175
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,060
我不想你听他的
Well,I don't want you to.

176
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:33,069
明白吗?
You understand?

177
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,081
你和Hurley呆一块儿
You stay with Hurley.

178
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:45,062
我或许不是个勇士  但我会去南边
I might not be a warrior,but I am going South.

179
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,027
等我回到家
Back home,

180
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:56,026
大家也会认为我是个勇士的
I'm known as something of a warrior myself.

181
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,081
我们用红线标记我们的行程
We mark our progress by line of sight.

182
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,094
把这个绑在树上  我们就不会迷路了
Tie these off so we don't get lost.

183
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,076
你能带我们回营地  对吧?
You can lead us back to camp,right?

184
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,062
如果我没发生什么意外的话
If nothing happens to me.

185
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,093
或许由我来做标记会更好一些
Maybe I'd better take marker detail.

186
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:34,023
有发现?
Anything?

187
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,012
还没
Not yet.

188
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,018
-如果你找不到踪迹...  -我会再找到的
-If you can't find the trail...  -I'll pick it up again.

189
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:42,025
我们得休息会儿好让思路清晰一些
We need to rest for a minute,to get our clarity back.

190
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:43,082
你们要休息?
You're gonna take a break?

191
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,055
快4:00点了  太阳一下山就不可能...
It's gotta be almost 4:00. When the sun sets,there's no way...

192
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,082
现在是4:25  但我要休息一下
It's 4:25. And,yes,I'm taking a break.

193
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:59,052
我和你谈谈?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

194
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:05,004
给他点空间  这又不会对你怎么样
Would it kill you to give the guy a little space?

195
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,062
会的
It might.

196
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:09,056
不要那样
Stop that.

197
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,069
那样
That.

198
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,037
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

199
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,017
我没有相信她...Claire
I didn't believe her...Claire.

200
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,068
-我给了她镇定药  -Jack  你不能...
-I gave her a sedative.  -Jack,you can't...

201
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:32,058
她告诉我有人在追她  有人要伤害她  我却..
she told me someone was after her,that she was being attacked,and I...

202
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,051
感觉她说的有点脱节
she just seemed so out of it.

203
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:38,001
我以为是怀孕增加了她的压力的缘故  我...
I thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress,and I...

204
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,005
我没有相信她
I didn't believe her.

205
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,078
Jack!

206
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:02,004
什么?
What is it?

207
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,013
很熟悉吧?
Look familiar?

208
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,004
是Charlie的
It's Charlie's.

209
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:11,083
你觉得这只是个意外的发现吗?
You think it just came off?

210
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,064
他在给我们暗示
He's leaving us a trail.

211
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,044
他们朝这边走了
They went this way.

212
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,066
我不是很确定
I'm not so sure.

213
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,077
这儿有另一个线索
There's another trail here.

214
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:40,083
-你什么意思  "另一个"?  -这些是脚印
-What do you mean,"another"?  -These are footprints.

215
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,021
他们朝这边移动
People moved off this way.

216
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,090
Charlie留下这些给我们作暗示
Charlie's leaving these for us to follow.

217
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,067
他们往那边去了
They went that way.

218
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,033
除非这些东西不是Charlie留下的
Unless Charlie isn't the one leaving them.

219
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,098
如果Ethan知道我们在跟踪他  他很可能会弄些假线索
If Ethan knows that we're behind him,he could be setting up a dummy trail.

220
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:01,055
在一个方向岔开  然后沿着原脚印往回走
Take off in one direction,double back in his old footprints.

221
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:06,008
等等  你也会跟踪?
Wait,now you're a tracker?

222
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,091
你真让人惊讶
You're just full of surprises.

223
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:11,093
所以我们有两条路可走
So we've got two trails.

224
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:14,032
我们分头找吧  我找这边
Let's split up. I'll take that one.

225
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,073
不行  我们得呆在一起  Jack
No,we should stay together,Jack.

226
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,057
为什么?  我们有两个线索  而且有两个会跟踪的人
Why? We've got two trails,and apparently two trackers.

227
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,071
小心点
Be careful.

228
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,057
谁被谁挟持走了?
Who got taken by what?

229
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,085
Charlie和Claire  他们都认为是Ethan干的
Charlie and Claire. They think Ethan took 'em.

230
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,029
-Ethan挟持他们?  -是的
-Ethan took 'em?  -Yeah.

231
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,089
为什么要挟持他们?  还有Ethan是谁?
Took 'em why? And who the hell's Ethan?

232
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,080
我不知道  他不在旅客名单上
I don't know. He wasn't on the list thing,the manifest.

233
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:53,073
有没想过  他有可能虚报他的名字?
Ever think he might have lied about his name?

234
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,020
虚报名字那太蠢了
It's stupid to lie about your name.

235
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,021
好吧  小子
All right,tattoo,

236
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:03,031
那你觉得Ethan从哪儿来的?
where do you think Ethan came from?

237
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:06,070
可能在我们来之前  他就在岛上了
Maybe he was already on the island before we were.

238
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:11,031
你可真会想象  孩子
Got yourself one hell of an imagination,kid.

239
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,089
岛上可能有许多人
There could be lots of other people on the island.

240
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:16,085
所以当地的邪恶部落派了个人潜入我们的营地
So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp

241
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:21,012
来绑架一个孕妇  而且这女子还是VH1电台扔在这儿的
to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH1 has-beens.

242
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,068
是的  简直太聪明了
Yeah,fiendishly clever.

243
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,048
为什么我要听一个6岁小子的话?
And why am I getting the evening news from a 6-year-old?

244
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:29,042
我10岁
I'm 10.

245
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,077
好吧  这就一定是真的了
Okay,then it must be true.

246
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:36,042
如果你不相信我  问问Sayid  他说岛上不只我们这些人
If you don't believe me,ask Sayid. He said we're not alone.

247
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,003
Sayid回来了?
Sayid's back?

248
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,095
-红衬衫  -啊?
-Red shirt.  -Huh?

249
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:59,001
红衬衫  你看过"星际之门"吗?
Red shirt. You ever watch "Star Trek"?

250
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,082
没看过
Oh,not really.

251
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,064
跟着一队人来到一个星球...
that would go down to the planet with the main guys...

252
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,064
首长和那个有尖耳朵的家伙
the captain and the guy with the pointy ears...

253
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,062
他们总穿着红衬衫  而且老是被杀
they always wore red shirts,and they always got killed.

254
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,085
-是吗?  -是的
-Yeah?  -Yeah.

255
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:20,095
听起来像是个可怜的首长
Sounds like a pisspoor captain.

256
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,060
在现实生活中你是干什么的  Locke先生?
What do you doin the real world,Mr. Locke?

257
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,045
-叫我John  -John
-It's John.  -John.

258
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,077
猜猜看?
Why don't you guess?

259
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:35,076
你要么是动物标本剥制师  要么就是职业杀手
Well,you're either a taxidermist or a hit man.

260
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,035
我是...
I was a...

261
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:46,026
包装箱公司的区域收集监督人员
regional collections supervisor for a box company.

262
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,077
包装箱公司?
A box company?

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,027
他们做盒子的
They made boxes.

264
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,003
是吗
Yeah,right.

265
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:04,072
-慢一点!  -你说他们朝这边走的
-Please slow down!  -You said they went this way.

266
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,060
我想他们朝这边走的  我没Locke那么厉害
I think they went this way. I'm not as good at this as Locke is.

267
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,067
这些跟踪技术你是哪里学来的  Kate?
So where'd you pick up the tracking skills,Kate?

268
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,091
是在通缉前还是通缉后学的?
Was that before or after you were on the run?

269
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,090
-我试着帮忙  Jack  -你知道什么东西帮得上忙?
-I'm trying to help,Jack.  -You know what might help?

270
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,050
诚实一点
A little honesty.

271
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,027
给我些真实的东西...任何东西都可以
Just give me something real --anything.

272
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,087
我爸爸是军队里的
My dad was in the army...

273
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,050
突击队
ranger battalion.

274
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:37,014
他驻扎在华盛顿州的路易丝堡
He was stationed at Fort Lewis,Washington State.

275
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,069
我们曾经一块儿远足
We'd go hiking together.

276
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:47,077
有一天  我们花了8个小时追一只鹿
One day we spent eight hours tracking deer.

277
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,096
呆在丛林里  感觉就像...
Being in the woods,it was like...

278
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,066
就像是他的宗教信仰
it was like his religion.

279
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,093
那是真实的
That was real.

280
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,099
你有什么要分享的吗  Jack?
Anything you wanna share,Jack?

281
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,036
感谢你能来  Jack  请坐
Well,thanks for coming in,Jack. Have a seat.

282
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,015
纸上写了什么?
What's it say?

283
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,091
事实
The truth...

284
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,061
发生车祸后  病人被送到了急诊室
that a patient was brought to the E.R. following a car accident,

285
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:43,002
有大范围的内出血  然后仓促进行手术
rushed into surgery with massive internal bleeding.

286
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:46,008
你和我是主刀医生  尽管尽了最大的努力
You joined me,and in spite of our most heroic efforts,

287
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,073
病人还是没能挺过来
the patient succumbed to her injuries.

288
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:53,000
看来除了病人  你把每件事都做得很完美
Looks like you fixed everything but the patient.

289
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,018
你在手术室没有认真工作
You had no business being in O.R.

290
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,050
你真以为如果碰上我应付不了的手术  我会走进手术室?
You really think I would have walked in there if I couldn't handle it?

291
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:03,068
你以前这么做过
You've done it before.

292
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:06,096
说得对  我有过  因为我有能力完美地把那些...
That's right,I have,because I am perfectly capable of making those ...

293
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:09,007
发生昨天那样的事  你居然还敢这么说?
How can you say that after what happened yesterday?

294
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,046
-问题不是...  -你的价值降低了
-The problem is not...  -You were impaired.

295
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,066
-我知道我的能力界限在哪  -我不会签这个字的
-I know my limits.  -I won't sign this.

296
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:17,032
你是小组中的一员  Jack
You were part of a team,Jack.

297
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,000
我不是唯一一个和这件事挂钩的
I'm not the only one on the hook for this.

298
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,004
你接替我做的手术
You called me off.

299
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,017
她死的时候档案里记录  你是主刀医生
You were the surgeon of record when she died.

300
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,098
听着  手术过程中发生意外是常有的事  Jack
Look,accidents happen in surgeries all the time,Jack.

301
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,005
那就是事实  你知道的
That's the truth,and you know it.

302
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,087
如果你抵触这份报告
But if you contradict this report,

303
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:37,097
如果你提到酒
if you mention alcohol,

304
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,095
那将会是造成事故的唯一事实
well,that's the only fact that's gonna matter.

305
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:43,066
他们会吊销我的执照的
They'll strip me of my license.

306
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,024
是的...
Yes...

307
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,018
他们会的
they will.

308
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:02,079
我知道我对你管教很严
I know I have been hard on you,

309
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:08,075
那是因为我恨铁不成钢
but that is how you make a soft metal into steel.

310
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,096
所以你才会成为
That is why

311
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:14,021
本市最有天赋的年轻外科医生
you are the most gifted young surgeon in this city.

312
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,092
我意思是  这是...
I mean,this...

313
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:27,097
这是一个可以带来很大好处的职业
this is a career that is all about the greater good.

314
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,043
在你和我关系上的某些方面...
I've had to sacrifice

315
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:36,015
我不得不做出牺牲
certain aspects of my relationship with you

316
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,086
那样成百上千的病人...
so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,012
会因为你高超的技术而活着
because of your extraordinary skills.

318
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:03,051
我知道这要等...
I know it's a long...

319
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:06,012
很长的时间
long time coming.

320
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,057
但昨天发生的事
What happened yesterday,

321
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,059
我向你保证
I promise you,

322
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,060
再也不会发生了
will never happen again.

323
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,089
我已经付出了那么多...
After what I've given...

324
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,067
这不只....这已经不只关系到我的职业  Jack
this isn't...this is not just about my career,Jack,

325
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:43,035
这是我的生命
it's my life.

326
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:11,019
谢谢你  儿子
Thank you,son.

327
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:38,082
我不知道你们伊斯兰教是否有命运这种概念
I don't know if you Islams got a concept of karma,

328
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:44,007
但我有种感觉  这个岛屿偿还了你很多东西
but I get the sense this island just served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback.

329
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:47,025
你想干什么?
What do you want?

330
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,083
"正义"医生不肯给我抗生素
Dr. Do-right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics

331
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,032
所以我只能每天自己来这儿取药了
so I gotta hump it up here every day to get my meds.

332
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:58,005
你知道  一个比我还没有雅量的人
You know,a less magnanimous man than I

333
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:01,039
也会觉得能够痛扁眼前这个苟且偷生的贱人
might just be thinking he could beat the ever-living snot out of you right now

334
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,074
而不必担心报复
without fear of reprisal.

335
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,047
你想打就打吧
You want a shot,take it.

336
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:09,096
但我要你知道  我离开是因为对自己的所作所为感到羞耻
Know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you.

337
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:12,038
我决不是故意要回来的
It was never my intention to return.

338
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:15,013
抱歉  我对请求宽容这种事已经免疫了
Sorry,fresh out of sweet forgiveness.

339
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:19,080
如果不是故意的  那你为什么要回来?
If it wasn't your intention to return,then why did you?

340
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,056
我被那个法国女子俘虏了
I was taken prisoner by the Frenchwoman.

341
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,015
那个发送了16年求救信号的法国女子?
The one that's been sending out a distress signal for 16 years?

342
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:31,023
她还活着?
She's alive?

343
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,092
她是一支科考队的
She was on a science expedition.

344
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:35,034
她说他们的船只失事了
She said they shipwrecked.

345
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,013
她一个人?
She alone?

346
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:40,016
她说岛上还有其他人
She said that there are others on this island.

347
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:43,084
不是  她认为她队里的人都病了
No,she believed they had all gotten sick.

348
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:48,006
她杀了整支科考队
She murdered her entire team.

349
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,032
那其他人他妈的又是谁?
And these others,who the hell are they?

350
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,049
我不知道
I don't know.

351
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,033
她从没看到过他们
She's never seen them.

352
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,078
她从没看到过他们  却知道他们在那儿?
Oh,she's never seen them,but she knows they're there?

353
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,027
如果你相信她的话
If you believe her.

354
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,037
或许不相信
Maybe not.

355
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,005
但在我回来的路上
But on my way back,

356
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:19,046
我听到丛林里有东西...
I heard something in the jungle...

357
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,016
围绕着我
surrounding me.

358
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,018
什么东西?
Something like what?

359
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,094
你还有什么要说的吗  Sawyer?
Have you got something to say to me,Sawyer?

360
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:33,092
还是继续问我  连我都不知道答案的问题?
Or are you going to continue asking me questions you know I don't have the answers to?

361
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:42,034
潮水涨到岸上了
Tide's coming up the beach.

362
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,089
机身几乎浸在水里了
The plane hull's almost in the water.

363
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,039
我继续用你的烧火方式求救
I kept your signal fire burning.

364
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,073
你孤立的棋子进不来了
Your blots can't get in.

365
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,025
是的  我知道那颗孤立的棋子进不来了
Yeah,I know my blots can't get in.

366
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,096
-轮到我掷骰子了  -喔哦!
-My roll.  -Yahoo!

367
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:04,011
我需要一个三  一个四
I need a four-three.

368
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,008
小子  你能不能快点?
Dude,would you please roll?

369
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,047
-好!  -不!
-Yes!  -No!

370
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,027
轮到你了
Your turn.

371
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,050
没事
It's okay.

372
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,072
我第一次玩的时候玩得也不好
I wasn't very good when I first started playing,either.

373
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,013
我不是第一次玩
I didn't just start playing.

374
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,040
我在联赛中获得了第17名
I took 17th in a tournament once.

375
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,064
-17名不怎么好啊  -不  17名很好
-17th is not very good.  -No,17th is very good.

376
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,086
拜托了  两个六  两个六
Come on,double sixes,double sixes.

377
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,076
-好!  -开什么玩笑
-Yes!  -Oh,you gotta be kidding me.

378
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:44,098
-我很幸运  -没人会那么幸运
-I'm lucky.  -No one is that lucky.

379
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,021
我爸爸说我是他认识的人中最幸运的家伙
My dad said I was the luckiest person he ever knew.

380
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,025
真的吗?
Really?

381
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,043
不是Michael  是Brian  我的另一个爸爸
Not Michael...Brian,my other dad.

382
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,062
是的
Yeah,um...

383
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:01,077
好!  好!
Yes! Yes!

384
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,072
来吧  再来一局  要么加倍付钱  要么一笔购销
Come on,one more game. Double or nothing.

385
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,045
我不能来了
I can't.

386
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:08,024
-会议?  -是的  一个会议
-A meeting?  -Yeah,a meeting.

387
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:11,090
-你欠我2000美元  -会给你的
-You owe me $20,000.  -You'll get it.

388
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:21,004
我们已经有15分钟没看到任何踪迹了
It's been about 15 minutes since we've seen any sign.

389
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,070
我们在跟踪什么?
What are we following?

390
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:27,004
-我的勇气  -很好
-My gut.  -Great.

391
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:33,024
那么Boone  在现实生活中你是干什么的?
So,Boone,what do you do in the real world?

392
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:34,074
我做生意的
I run a business.

393
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:39,062
-什么生意?  -一些婚礼的东西
-What kind of business?  -It's a wedding thing.

394
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,098

397
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,025
那么现在由谁管呢?
So,who's running it now?

398
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,076
这已经不重要了  不是吗?
I guess it doesn't matter,does it?

399
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:58,048
我想会有人临时接管的
I'm sure there are people who can handle it temporarily.

400
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,020
一分钟后将下雨
It's gonna start raining in one minute.

401
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,064
-一分钟?  -几秒种的偏差

402

你应该折回  Boone  回去
You should turn around,Boone,head back.

403
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,046
什么?
What?

已经有1/4英里我们没看到踪迹了  前面很危险
Trail's been cold for 1/4 mile,dangerous terrain ahead.

405
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,017
如果你现在回去就能在天黑前赶到营地
If you start now,you'll make it back to camp before dark.

我不会回去的
I'm not heading back.

409
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,041

在包装箱公司他们教你如何预测天气?

412
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:05,052

Jack  你去哪儿?
Jack, where are you going?

415
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:21,059
你听到她了吗?
Didn't you hear her?

416
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,039
听到谁?
Hear who?

417
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,065
Jack!

418
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,010

我会杀了他们其中一个
I will kill one of them.

420
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,026

和我父亲说话的那人是谁?

是那病人的丈夫
That's her husband.

427

我昏了多久了?

437
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,090
你得停手了
You have to stop.

438
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:50,055
雨水把痕迹都冲掉了

00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:58,036
-不让他?  -不再让了
-Not letting him?  -Not again.

442
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:07,099
我们发现她的血压急速下降
We realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously.

443
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:11,034
此刻  病人的心脏停止跳动
At which point,the patient went into cardiac arrest.

444
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,061
当然  我们尽了最大的努力抢救
Of course,every effort was made to resuscitate her,

445
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,067
但是严重的伤势...
but the severity of her injuries...

446
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:21,060
以及大量的内出血使得我们无力挽救她的生命
the amount of internal bleeding made that impossible.

447
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:27,032
按照我的职业观点  女士们先生们  我要说的是...
Now,in my professional opinion,ladies and gentlemen,and that's all I have...

448
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:32,084
当我赶到的时候  形势已经无法逆转了
by the time I was called in,the damage was irreversible.

449
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,034
好的  谢谢  Christian
Okay. Thanks,Christian.

450
00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:39,096
-我们对这种形式主义感到抱歉  -好的
-Sorry about this formality.  -Of course.

451
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,067
最后一个细节
Just one final detail.

452
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,060
你动手术的时候知道病人已经怀孕了吗?
You were aware of the patient's pregnancy when you went into the procedure?

453
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:50,070
病人的丈夫为预产的事来过急诊室
The patient's husband had informed the attending in the E.R.

454
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:53,077
不过是在怀孕很早期的时候
It was,however,extremely early in the pregnancy

455
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:56,056
所以我们把重点主要放在母亲身上
so our primary focus had to be on the mother.

456
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,039
好的  那么  我想我们问完了
Okay,then,I think we're done here.

457
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,074
最终结果将做成档案
Our final report will be filed.

458
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,019
好的
Okay.

459
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:09,076
我需要...
I need to...

460
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:14,034
修正一下我的陈述词
revise my statement.

461
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:23,054
我是了解情况以后才进的手术室
I didn't come into the O.R. until well into the procedure.

462
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:24,011
Jack

463
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,076
我被一个护士提醒  我父亲在受影响的情况下...
I was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating...

464
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,095
给病人动手术
under the influence.

465
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,032
等我赶到那的时候  很明显我父亲已经...
By the time I got there,it was clear that my father was

466
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,087
无法控制局面了  同时他还...
not only incapacitated,but that he had also...

467
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,076
割断了病人的肝动脉
severed the patient's hepatic artery,

468
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:46,026
按照我的职业观点
which,in my professional opinion,

469
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:51,034
这造成了病人的最终死亡
caused the crisis which led to her death.

470
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,044
不!
No!

471
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:27,004
你去把绳子割断
You gotta cut him down.

472
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:39,022
坚持住  Charlie  坚持住
Hold on,Charlie. Hold on there.

473
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,069
我够不到!  拉他过来!
I can't reach! Pull him over!

474
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
他停止呼吸了
He's not breathing.

475
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:41,083

你记得的事情  你去过哪了
