迷失前情提要...
Previously on "lost"...

00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,068
有律师来找我
Some lawyers came to see me.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,089
他们想知道Aaron是不是我儿子
They wanted to test to see if Aaron's my son.

4
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:09,065
你得解决这件事
You need to take care of them.

5
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:13,045
你会不惜一切保住Aaron吧

我们得回到兰花站
We have to go back the orchid.

13
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,064
一切从那里开始  或许可以在那里结束
That's where all this started. maybe it's where it'll all stop.

14
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:36,034
发生这一切  是因为他们的离开
This is happening because they left.

15
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,066
如果我带他们回来  或许能阻止这一切

24
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:24,054
明天我就坐飞机回来了

25
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:28,058

再见啦

34
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:20,071
为什么要骚扰我们母子?!
Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,006
因为他不是你的儿子  Kate
Because he's not your son, Kate.

36
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,091
走开  Kate
Move away, Kate.

42
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,013
-你有  -不  我没有

43
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:49,045
没人杀害他  因为他没死
Neither did anyone else, because he's not dead.

44
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:55,059
你说谎
You're lying.

45
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,050

到了那  我们就能寻找帮助了

73
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,036

00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,050
你消失了!
You disappeared!

180
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,083
不  等等!
No! please, wait!

181
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,012
你也病了  你是带菌者!  不!
You're sick, too! you're a carrier! no!

182
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,050
慢慢转过身去
Turn around slowly.

183
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,092
Jin?

184
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,029
Sawyer?

185
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,058
Jin!

186
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,028
没搞错吧!
You gotta be kiddin' me!

187
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:21,085
我以为你上船了  我以为你死了
I thought you were on that boat. I thought you were dead.

188
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:24,028
没  没有  我...掉水里了
No. no. i...in water.

189
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:27,003
真是不可思议啊
Well, what do you say?

190
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:34,095
Sun去哪了?
Where is sun?

191
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:47,034
那家伙从哪冒出来的?  我以为他在船上呢
Where did that guy come from? I thought he was on the boat.

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,048
肯定是爆炸把他炸到海里去了
The blast must've thrown him in the water.

193
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,094
他也像我们一样  穿梭时空
He's been moving with every flash, just like us.

194
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:56,077
每次天空闪亮时
Every time the sky lights up,

195
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:00,026
我们就...穿梭时空了
We...move through time.

196
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,071
翻译
Translate.

197
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,067
求你了  翻译
Please. translate.

198
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:12,048
你听到他的话了  翻译啊
You heard the man. translate.

199
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:15,066
拜托  他是韩国人  我又不是
Uh, he's korean. I'm from encino.

200
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,064
他想知道
He wants to know

201
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,089
你们怎么会肯定他老婆不在岛上
How you're sure his wife is off the island.

202
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,006
-你会说韩语?  -很明显嘛
-You speak korean, red? -obviously.

203
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,090
告诉他我能肯定  但是如果我们不去兰花站
Tell him I'm sure, but none of it will matter

204
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,077
就没用了
If we don't make it to the orchid.

205
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:39,050
他肯定  但是他说...

206
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,022
我们得回到那个兰花站

207
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:42,060
什么兰花站?

208
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,043
在岛的的另外一边

209
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:47,004
Locke计划离开这里...

210
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,075
去带回所有离开的人

211
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:50,073
包括你妻子

212
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,073
他认为这是唯一停止穿梭的办法

213
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,076
把Sun带回来?
Bring sun back?

214
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:00,055
为什么要带她回来?
Why you bring her back?

215
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:03,056
因为她原本就不该离开
Because she never should have left.

216
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:19,089
我花了三年的时间...
I've spent the last three years thinking...

217
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:23,016
来相信他已经死了
Believing that he was dead.

218
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:27,009
你却说你能证明他没死  证明给我看
You say you have proof that he's not. I want to see it.

219
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,026
何不先放下枪?  没人希望它走火
Why don't you put down the gun? no one wants it to go off.

220
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,003
你怎么知道他还活着?!
How do you know he's alive?!

221
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,055
某人...
there's someone...

222
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:39,027
某人在洛杉矶
Someone here in los angeles.

223
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,076
让我带你过去  然后我会证明给你看
Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.

224
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:46,032
"某人"?  是谁?  同样是一个
"someone"? who? the same person

225
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:48,045
要带你们回岛上去的人
That's gonna shows how to get back to the island.

226
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,012
原来是这样?
Is that what this is about?

227
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:55,045
-你早就知道了?  -不不 我...
-You knew about this? -no. no, I was...

228
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,046
所以你才会假装关心Aaron
And that is why you were pretending to care about Aaron,

229
00:18:57,046 --> 00:19:00,014
-来说服我回去?!  -我没有假装任何事
-To convince me to go back there?! -I wasn't pretending anything.

230
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,089
-真是疯了  你们都发疯了  -Kate...
-This is insane. you guys are crazy. -Kate...

231
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,058
Jack  别说了!
Jack, don't!

232
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,042
Sayid  你去哪里?
Sayid, where are you going?

233
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:14,005
我不想这样做  如果我再看到你或他
I don't want any part of this. and if I see you or him again?

234
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,051
我们都会非常不愉快
It'll be extremely unpleasant for all of us.

235
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,043
Sun  只要30分钟
30 minutes, sun.

236
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,083
30分钟我们就能到那
We can be there in 30 minutes.

237
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,086
我就能证明...证明他活着
And you'll have proof...proof that he's alive.

238
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,005
不然你就杀了我  永远都不知道他是死是活
Or you can shoot me and never know.

239
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:44,023
走吧
Let's go.

240
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,052
还有多远?
How far?

241
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,065
过下座桥就到了
It's just over the next ridge.

242
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:03,020
-你打算如何离开那岛?  -我还不知道
-How you will leave the island? -I'm not sure yet.

243
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,023
-我和你一起去  -不不  不能这样
-I go with you. -no, no. it doesn't work like that.

244
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:07,078
-只要一个人就行了  -为什么?
-It's a 1-man job. -why?

245
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:10,000
我不知道为什么  Jin  但必须这样
I don't know why, Jin. it just is.

246
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,024
我保证我会带Sun回来的
But I promise I'll bring sun back.

247
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,001
你没事吧?
You okay?

248
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:17,016
要休息一会吗?
You wanna take a break?

249
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,076
还是快点去吧
let's just get there.

250
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,000
好的
Yeah.

251
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,043
那个...
So, uh...

252
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,053
你还会讲其它语言吗?
You speak any other languages?

253
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,026
只会讲克林贡语
Just klingon.

254
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,076
Dan  这行得通吗?
Dan, is this gonna work?

255
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,025
从经验来讲应该可以
It...it does make empirical sense

256
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,035
如果一切是从兰花站开始
That if this started at the orchid,

257
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,055
那么也就应该可以结束这一切
Then that's where it's gonna stop.

258
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:39,050
但是至于把离开的人带回来
But as far as bringing back people who left

259
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,020
为了停止这些暂时错乱
In order to stop these temporal shifts,

260
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,077
那就没任何科学依据了
That's where we leave science behind.

261
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,077
你没事吧?
You okay?

262
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,079
不是吧
Oh, no!

263
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,087
搞什么
Come on!

264
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,023
Charlotte!
Charlotte!

265
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,051
-Charlotte   -Juliet
-Charlotte   -Juliet

266
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,009
-怎么?  -你也有点...
-Huh? -you have a little...

267
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,083
你也是
You, too.

268
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,031
Charlotte!
Charlotte!

269
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,043
能听到我说话吗?  Charlotte?
Can you hear me? Charlotte?

270
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,007
能听到吗?
Can you hear me?

271
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,016
Charlotte? char...
Charlotte? char...

272
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:02,027
她说什么?
What'd she say?

273
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,039
别让他们带她回来
Don't let them bring her back,

274
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:06,010
不管怎样
No matter what.

275
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,044
别让他们带她回来
Don't let them bring her back.

276
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,047
这是个死亡之岛
This place is death.

277
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,010
你说30分钟就到了
You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.

278
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:31,047
我没算交通堵塞时间
I didn't account for traffic.

279
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,017
Sun  对不起
Sun, I'm sorry.

280
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,048
对不起什么?
Sorry for what?

281
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,029
扔下Jin不管
For leaving Jin behind.

282
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,037
我们将直升机降落在船上的时候...
When we landed that chopper on the boat...

283
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,093
一切都发生的太快
Everything was just happening so fast.

284
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,071
我知道他在下面  但我...
I knew he was down below, but i...

285
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,023
我应该等他的
Should've waited for him.

286
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,031
Jack  你干嘛和我说这些?
Why are you telling me this now, jack?

287
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,099
你是要问我是否会杀了Ben
Are you going to ask me not to kill ben

288
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,080
如果他骗了我?
If he's lying about my husband?

289
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,015
他这样对Kate  就算你不杀他  我也会
After what he just did to Kate, if you don't do it, sun, I will.

290
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,009
你干嘛?!
What are you doing?!

291
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,029
我是在帮助你们
What I'm doing is helping you.

292
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,018
如果你们知道我做的一切都是为了
And if you had any idea what I've had to do

293
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:30,014
让你们安全  让你们的朋友们安全
To keep you safe, to keep your friends safe,

294
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,031
你们都不知道该如何感谢我
You'd never stop thanking me.

295
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,001
你想开枪吗  那就开吧
You wanna shoot me? then shoot me!

296
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,025
但我们最好还是快去
But let's get on with it.

297
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,055
怎么样?
What's it gonna be?

298
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,094
开车
Drive.

299
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:05,076
为什么爸爸不跟我们一起
Why can't daddy come with us?

300
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,013
Charlotte  能听见我说话吗
Charlotte, can you hear me?

301
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:10,006
你知道我妈妈会说什么吗
You know what my mum would say

302
00:24:10,006 --> 00:24:11,076
关于我要嫁给美国人
About me marrying an american?

303
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:16,082
我比Hannibal知道古代Carthage更多
Yeah, I know more about ancient carthage than hannibal himself.

304
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,096
她到底在说什么
What the hell is she talking about?

305
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:22,028
不知道
Have no idea.

306
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,068
我们走  得继续赶路
Let's go. we have to keep moving.

307
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,058
好吧  谁和我帮Charlotte
All right, somebody help me with Charlotte.

308
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:27,086
-我们得带着她  -不  她会成为我们的负担
-We're gonna have to carry her, -no. she's gonna hold us up.

309
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:32,024
-我们不能扔下她  -闪光越来越频繁了
-We...we can't just leave her. -the flashes are getting closer together.

310
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:33,082
或许你流鼻血的时候
Maybe when your nose starts bleeding,

311
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:35,076
你会觉得我们应该放下负担
You'll realize we gotta get out of dodge now.

312
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:39,058
-等有机会再回来找她  -不  不行
-We'll come back for her just as soon as we can. -no. no way.

313
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,007
我们不能扔下她
We're not gonna leave her behind.

314
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,022
Daniel  让他们走吧
Let them go without me, daniel.

315
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:45,066
不  Charlotte  我不会扔下你的
No, Charlotte. no. I'm not gonna leave you behind.

316
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,016
怎么回事?!
the hell?!

317
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:54,074
-我们得马上走  -他是对的  走吧
-We have to move now! -he's right. go.

318
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:56,007
-Charlotte  -快走
-Charlotte...-just...no, just go!

319
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:57,080
Charlotte...
Charlotte...

320
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,013
快开电视
Ohh! oh, turn it up.

321
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:02,027
我喜欢Geronimo Jackson
I love Geronimo Jackson.

322
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,088
Dan  没时间了
We're running out of time, Dan.

323
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,064
我会留下来陪着她
I'm gonna stay with her.

324
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:17,008
John  我来问你
Let me ask you something, John.

325
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,004
如果我们不知道我们到底在什么时代
If we don't even know when the hell we are.

326
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,006
如果兰花站不在了该怎么办
What happens if the orchid ain't around anymore?

327
00:25:23,085 --> 00:25:25,004
去找那口井
Look for the well.

328
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,009
你会在井那找到的
You'll find it at the well.

329
00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:32,021
好的  我们肯定会照做的
Yeah, we'll be sure and do that.

330
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:34,085
我们走
Let's go.

331
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,061
我们到了
We're here.

332
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:21,056
谢天谢地  太好了
Thank god. what are the odds

333
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,039
它还在这里
That we would end up in the same time as this thing?

334
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,058
你还真是乌鸦嘴
You just had to say somethin'.

335
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,082
Charlotte咋会知道这里有口井的?
How the hell did Charlotte know this was here?

336
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,079
-Daniel  -怎么了
-Daniel? -yes?

337
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:31,001
我以前来过这
I've been here before.

338
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:36,067
你以前来过这?
You've been...you've been here before?

339
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,098
我在岛上长大
I grew up here, on the island.

340
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,028
有这么一个组织...
Mm, there was this thing...

341
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,014
达摩组织
The Dharma initiative.

342
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,092
后来我跟我妈妈离开了
And then I moved away with my mum.

343
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,023
只跟我妈妈
Just my mom,

344
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,093
我再也没见过我爸爸
And I never saw my dad again.

345
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,082
我回到英国的时候
And then when I got back to england,

346
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:57,013
向我妈妈问起这地方的时候
W-when I would ask my mum about this place, yeah?

347
00:27:57,018 --> 00:28:00,087
她说这不是真的  都是我编出来的
But she would say that it wasn't real and that I'd made it up.

348
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:06,082
那就是为什么我成了一位人类学家...
That's why...I became an anthropologist...

349
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:09,057
为了再找到这座岛
To find this island again.

350
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,030
我一生都在找这座岛
It's what I've been searching for my whole life.

351
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:16,083
Charlotte...
Charlotte...

352
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,051
为什么你要告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this?

353
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,010
因为我现在想起一些事情
Because I remember something now.

354
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,076
我小的时候...
When I was little...

355
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,008
住在这里
Living here,

356
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:35,056
有这么个人...
There was this man...

357
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:39,006
一个疯子...他真的把我吓到了
A crazy man...he really scared me.

358
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,073
他告诉我  我必须要离开这座岛...
And he told me that I had to leave the island...

359
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:43,068
再也不能回来
And never, ever come back.

360
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:45,012
他跟我说
He told me

361
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,059
如果我回来的话
That if I came b-back,

362
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,009
我就会死
I would die.

363
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:53,044
Charlotte...
Charlotte...

364
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,071
我不明白
I don't understand.

365
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,075
Daniel.
Daniel.

366
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:01,099
我...我想那个人就是你
I...I think that man was you.

367
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:16,068
你准备下去?
You're going down there?

368
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:22,005
你到底想找到些什么?
What exactly are you hoping to find?

369
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,069
找到离开小岛的办法
A way off the island.

370
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,088
不会是指望有地铁吧?
You expecting a subway?

371
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,071
再见了  James
Good-bye, James.

372
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:31,098
Juliet  Miles
Juliet  Miles

373
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,003

374
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:34,030
不  等等
No. stop.

375
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:36,097
别带Sun回来
You don't bring sun back.

376
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,060
不行  我得带所有人回来
No, I have to bring them all back.

377
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,000
因为必须这么做
That's...that's how it works.

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,058
你怎么知道?
How you know?

379
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,011
我...我就是知道
I-i...I just know.

380
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,086
-我会割断这个  -别  这样我们都会死
-I will cut this. -no. you do that, you'll kill every one of us.

381
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:55,089
这小岛不好  别带Sun回来  你发誓
This island is bad. you don't bring sun back. you promise.

382
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:57,066
发誓你不会带我孩子来!
You promise you don't bring my baby!

383
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:00,033
好的  好的  我答应你
All right. all right. you have my word.

384
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,090
John  你要发誓

385
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,068
我发誓
I promise.

386
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,013
我不去找Sun  但她可能会找到我
I won't go to sun, Jin, but she might find me.

387
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,019
如果她找到我  我怎么说?
If she does, what do I tell her?

388
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,077
你告诉她  我死了
You tell her I'm dead.

389
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:34,004
你说我淹死了
You say I wash up.

390
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:36,028
是你埋的我
You burry me.

391
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:42,054
证据
Proof.

392
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,064
我会尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

393
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,017
你确定不要我们放你下去?
You sure you don't want us to lower you down?

394
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,093
这样的话  就不好玩啦
Where would be the fun in that?

395
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,069
John.
John.

396
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,093
如果你做的这些  管用了的话
If whatever you're attempting to do actually works,

397
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,071
谢谢你了
Thank you.

不客气
You're welcome.

399
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:20,030
不会吧?!
What?!

400
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,096
John  妈的  撑住!
John! damn it, hold on!

401
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:38,034
我想你可以放下手里的东西了
I think you can let go of that now.

402
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,070
不行
No.

403
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,053
-不  不  -James  算了

406
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:52,089
James.


407
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:56,071
我们帮不了他
We can't help him.

408
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:05,033
撑着  撑着
hold on. hold on.

409
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:11,063
撑下去
Stay. sta...stay with me.

410
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,002
就这样待着  好吗?
just stay, okay?

411
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:16,004
你会没事的  一切都会没事的
You're gonna be fine. everything's gonna be okay.

412
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:17,027
我有个计划
I've got a plan.

413
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:18,085
我有个计划
I've got a plan.

414
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:22,044
当我们回到那个舱门时  我告诉Desmond

415
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:26,036

你妈妈怎么帮我们?
How can your mother help us?

00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:34,049
她能  她...

00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,070
-听着  听着  -嗯?
-Hey, hey. listen, listen. -yeah?

421
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,060
什么?
What?

422
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:52,030
他们不准我饭前吃巧克力的
I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner.

423
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,066
Charlotte?
Charlotte.

424
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,009
Charlotte?
Charlotte.

425
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:07,041
Charlotte.
Charlotte.

426
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,088
不
No.

427
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:42,032
James!
James!

428
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:45,038
能听到我说话吗?!
Can you hear me?!

429
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,072
有人听到我说话吗?!
Can anyone hear me?!

430
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,098
谁在那?
Who's there?

431
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,083
你好啊  John
Hello, John.

432
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:20,058
是你?
You?

433
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,005
你到下面来干嘛?
What are you doing down here?

434
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:27,072
我来助你一臂之力
I'm here to help you the rest of the way.

435
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:33,067
我不...我不懂
I don't...I don't understand.

436
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:36,025
上次你来小屋来我时
You came to see me in the cabin.

437
00:35:37,008 --> 00:35:38,077
问我该如何救这个小岛
You asked me how to save the island,

438
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,058
我告诉你应该移动它
And I told you you had to move it.

439
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,040
我说是你来移动它  John
I said that you had to move it, John.

440
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,027
可是Ben说他知道如何移动
But ben said he knew how to do it.

441
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:57,094
他说我应该待在这里  领导他的人
He told me that I had to stay here and lead his people.

442
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,022
从什么时候开始
And since when did listening to him

443
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:03,067
你听信他的谗言了?
Get you anywhere worth a damn?

444
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,038
不过好消息是...
The good news...

445
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:12,081
现在你来这里了
Is that you're here now.

446
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,071
你准备好出发了吗?
Are you ready to go?

447
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:19,044
我...我不知道...
I-i d...i don't know...

448
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:21,087
我到了那里之后  该怎么做
what to do once I get there.

449
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:25,027
有个住在洛杉矶的女人
There's a woman living in los angeles.

450
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,077
等你朋友都聚齐之后...
And once you get all of your friends together...

451
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:30,049
一定要聚齐所有离开的人
And it must be all of them, everyone who left.

452
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:33,043
一旦你说服他们加入你之后...
And once you've persuaded them to join you...

453
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:37,078
这个女人会告诉你如何回来
This woman will tell you exactly how to come back.

454
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,040
谁...她是谁?
Who...who is she?

455
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:43,049
她叫Eloise Hawking
Her name is eloise hawking.

456
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:48,082
如果我只能说服部分人回来呢?
What if can only convince some of them to come back?

457
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,053
John  我相信你能的
I believe in you, John.

458
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,061
你能做到的
You can do this.

459
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:01,008
Richard说我要去死
Richard said I was going to die.

460
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,082
我想这就是...
Well, I suppose that's...

461
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:08,033
为什么他们称之为牺牲
That's why they call it sacrifice.

462
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,007
好吧
All right.

463
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:24,095
好 好了  我准备好了
Okay. oh, yeah, I'm ready.

464
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:27,043
很好
Good.

465
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,009
现在...
Now...

466
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:35,033
在隧道另一头
On the other side of this column here

467
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,042
有个从轴上松脱的转轮
Is a wheel that slipped off its axis.

468
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:42,031
你要做的就是稍微推它一下
And all you have to do is give it a little push.

469
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:50,097
你...你能帮我一把吗?
Could...could you help me up?

470
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,046
不能
No.

471
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,019
对不起  我不能
Sorry, I can't.

472
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:36,051
祝你好运  John
Good luck, John.

473
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,023
和我儿子打个招呼
Say hello to my son.

474
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:07,051
谁是你儿子?
Who's your son?

475
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,065
可以吗?

476
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,042
拿着
Take it.

477
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:02,095
你怎么有这个的?
How do you have this?

478
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:07,007
-John给我的  -你说John从没找过你
-John gave it to me. -you said John never came to see you.

479
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:10,078
没错  Jack  是我去找的他
That's true, jack. I went to see him.

480
00:40:11,061 --> 00:40:13,068
在他离开岛之前  Jin给他的
Jin gave it to him before he left the island.

481
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:15,094
为什么Locke不亲自给我?
Why didn't locke tell me himself?

482
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:19,063
我不知道  可能在他死前 一直没机会告诉你吧
I don't know. maybe he never had a chance before he died.

483
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,098
对不起  在我给这个你之前
I'm sorry I had to bring you here

484
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,036
我必须带你来这  Sun
Before I gave it to you, sun.

485
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:26,069
可是留在岛上的人  包括Jin
But all those people back on the island, Jin included,

486
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,067
都需要我们的帮助
Need our help.
