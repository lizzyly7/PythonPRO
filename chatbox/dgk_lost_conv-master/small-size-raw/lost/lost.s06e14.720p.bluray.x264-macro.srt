00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,170
Locke先生?
Mr. Locke?

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,490
Locke先生 你能听见我说话么?
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,590
你醒了 恭喜啊
Welcome back.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,510
我认识你
I know you.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,720
我们搭乘过同一班从悉尼来的飞机
We were on the same flight back from Sydney.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,450
曾在行李认领申报处见过面
I met you in the baggage claim office.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,800
你的刀掉了
You had lost your knives.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,750
我是Jack Shephard
I'm Jack Shephard.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,750
我怎么了?
What happened?

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,260
你被车撞了 刚做完手术
You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,800
我...
Am I...

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,160
我没事吧?
Am I all right?

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,350
你的硬脊膜囊破裂
Your dural sac ruptured.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,470
不过 手术很成功 一切都会复原的
But I think I got everything back where it belongs.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,510
Locke先生 在动手术的时候 我看了一下
Mr. Locke, while I was operating, I got a look

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,130
你脊椎之前受的伤...
at the initial injury to your spine...

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
就是累及你坐轮椅的伤处
The one that put you in the wheelchair.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,020
我希望你能告诉我 受伤的原因
And I was hoping you could tell me how that happened.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,220
凭什么?
Why?

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,050
因为我觉得你符合候选人的条件
Because I think you're a candidate.

22
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,220
哪种候选人?
A candidate for what?

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,160
我们正在研发的
A new procedure,

24
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,720
一种新型外科手术 还有...
a surgery we're developing, and...

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,390
如果它生效的话 你的腿就能恢复知觉了
if it works, it could restore feeling to your legs.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,920
说不准 你还可以重新站起来走路
In fact, you may even walk again.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,140
如果你让我试试 Locke先生
If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke,

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,500
我觉得... 我可以治好你
I think that... that I could fix you.

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,810
不 谢谢
No, thank you.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,800
手术几乎没什么风险 而且... 如果你康复了...
Well, now there's minimal risk, and... and the benefit could...

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,210
医生 我说了不用
I said no, doctor.

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,760
John啊?
John?

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,090
哦
Oh.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,140
哦 John
Oh, John.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,020
- 他们总算让我见你了 - 哦!
- It's the first time they let me see you. - Oh!

36
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,487
你... 你还好么?
Are... are you okay?

37
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:59,427
我没事 别担心
I'm fine. Hi.

38
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:01,587
你是他的主治医生么?
Are you his doctor?

39
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,207
嗯 没错 我是Shephard医生
Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.

40
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,087
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

41
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,797

00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:10,737
谢谢
Thank you.

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
欢迎来到九头蛇岛
Welcome to Hydra Island.

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,680
至少 你不用划桨 就已经到了
At least you didn't have to paddle.

45
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,346
进来吧
Get in.

46
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,026
啊哈
Unh-unh.

47
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,086
我才不要进这些笼子里去
Ain't no way I'm gettin' back in those cages.

48
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:06,546
- 我手上可拿着枪呢 你... - 现在没了 兵哥哥
- Well, I've got the gun, so you... - Not anymore, doughboy.

49
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,446
把枪放下!
Drop the gun!

50
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:10,886
放下枪 否则我杀了她
Put the gun down or I'll kill her!

51
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,276
你不会杀人的
You ain't gonna kill anybody.

52
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,116
否则 你就不会把我们关到笼子里去了
Otherwise, you wouldn't be throwing us in a cage.

53
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:18,516
我这儿有份名单 Ford 上面有你的大名
I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it,

54
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,856
还有Reyes和Kwon夫妇
As are Reyes and the Kwons.

55
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,586
- 名单上有Kate Austen吗? - 没有她
- Kate Austen? - She's not.

56
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,826
所以她是死是活 我才不在乎
It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies.

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,120
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,730
你或许不信
You may not believe it,

59
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,880
但我是为了你好
but I'm doing this for your own good.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,210
你说得没错 我不相信
You're right. I don't believe it.

61
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
- 守卫来了吗? - 他们说大概还要一个小时
- Is the fence live yet? - They're saying about an hour.

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,610
我们没那么多时间 叫他们快一点儿
We haven't got an hour. Tell them to work faster.

63
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,090
他就快来了
He's coming.

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:26,090

抱歉 前台没人
I'm sorry. There was no one out front,

70
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
我听见这里有钻机的声音
and I heard the drill.

71
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,770
- 我想找Nadler医生 您知道他在哪儿么? - 远在天边 近在眼前
- Do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler? - Well, you can find him right here.

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,890
如果你不是病人 你可以直接叫我Bernard
And if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard.

73
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,000
嗨
Hi.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,950
我叫Jack Shephard
Jack Shephard.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,540
呃 我是St. Sebastian医院的外科医生
Um, I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian,

76
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,960
我想借您手下一名患者的资料看看
and I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files.

77
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,370
这位病患的名字是?
And which patient would that be?

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,190
他叫John Locke 我们有资料显示
His name's John Locke, and our records said

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,520
你曾给他做过一个急诊手术
that you had done some emergency oral surgery on him

80
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,820
这大概是三年前的事了
about three years back.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,170
- 那你到底想探寻些什么? - 我想知道他受伤的原因
- And what are you looking for, exactly? - I wanna know how he was hurt.

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,560
你介意我问问
Do you mind if I ask you

83
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,490
你为何对Locke先生如此感兴趣么 Jack?
why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?

84
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
呃...
Um...

85
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,770
大约一周前 我遇见了他
He and I met about a week ago.

86
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,670
- 我们乘坐的 是来自澳大利亚的同一班飞机 - 大洋航班815
- We were on the same flight back from Australia. - Oceanic 815.

87
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,810
我的座位 跟你之间隔了条走道
I sat across the aisle from you.

88
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,040
如果你还记得的话
If memory serves,

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,900
你当时还跟我妻子Rose调情来着
you were flirting with my wife Rose

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,290
而我去了卫生间
when I was in the bathroom.

91
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,220
无巧不成书 对吧?
It's pretty weird, huh?

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,750
嗯
Yeah.

93
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,230
呃... 或许有些事 你心知肚明 对吧?
Well... Maybe you're on to something here, hmm?

94
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,140
病人的资料是保密的
Now I can't break patient confidentiality

95
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
我不能违反规定 私自透露
and tell you something I shouldn't,

96
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,240
但我可以告诉你 当我给Locke先生治疗的时候
But I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke,

97
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,310
和他一同出事的 还有另一个男人
there was another man in the same accident with him.

98
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,250
等等 这是... 三年前的事了
Wait, that was... three years ago.

99
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,220
你还... 记得?
You just... remember that?

100
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,740
当然了 Jack
Of course I do, Jack.

101
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,570
是Anthony Cooper
Anthony Cooper.

102
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,590
祝你好运 医生
Good luck, doc.

103
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
我希望你能得偿所愿
I hope you find what you're looking for.

104
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
发生什么事了?
What happened?

105
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,380
我们遭到了迫击炮轰
There was a mortar attack.

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,580
Widmore的人朝我们开火
Widmore's people fired on us.

107
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,560
Locke救了你
Locke saved you.

108
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,190
其他人呢?
What about the rest of your group?

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,710
他们怎么了?
What happened to them?

110
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,990
没死的人 都逃进了丛林
The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,830
现在只剩3个人了
It's just the three of us now.

112
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,010
他干嘛带我来这儿?
Why did he bring me here?

113
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,830
因为你的朋友被抓了
Because your friends got themselves captured.

114
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,530
现在...
And now...

115
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,890
我们要去救他们
we're gonna have to rescue them.

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,250
到哪里去救?
Rescue them from what?

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,190
Widmore把他们关在一个笼子里 大约在半英里开外的内陆
Widmore has them in a cage about a half a mile inland.

118
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,240
他干嘛...
Why would he...

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,450
我会问他的
You know, I would ask him,

120
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,890
只是 我觉得他不会直截了当地告诉我
except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer.

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,750
而且 我觉得他居心叵测
But I can't imagine that his intentions are good.

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,610
如果我们现在动身
If we move right now,

123
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,020
我们可以杀Widmore一个措手不及
we can break your people out, run for the plane

124
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,110
救出你的人 然后冲上飞机 离开这个岛
and be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,740
他们不是我的人
They're not my people.

126
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,760
我也不会离开这个岛
And I'm not leaving the island.

127
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,500
好吧 Jack
Well, Jack,

128
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,040
我希望你有朝一日 能改变主意
I'm hoping you'll still change your mind about that.

129
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,080
不过你的朋友们 可是想死了要走
But your friends do want to leave.

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,100
由于之前他们撇开我 驾着我的船跑了
And since they just ran away from me on my own boat,

131
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,710
我需要你帮我劝服他们
I'm gonna need your help convincing them

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,050
让他们相信我
that they can trust me.

133
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,930
我凭什么相信你?
Why should I trust you?

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,930
因为此时此刻 我可以杀了你
Because I could kill you, Jack, right here, right now.

135
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,440
我还可以杀掉你的每一个朋友
And I could kill every single one of your friends,

136
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,980
而你却无力阻拦
and there's not a thing that you could do to stop me.

137
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,490
可我没有杀你 相反 我救了你
But instead of killing you, I saved your life.

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,670
而且我也想救他们
And now I wanna save them, too.

139
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,180
所以 你会帮我吗?
So will you help me?

140
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,110
我们真像是在兜圈子 对吧?
You feel like we're runnin' in circles?

141
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,310
兜来兜去还在笼子里...
Back in these cages...

142
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,420
除了上次 被人拿枪指着脑袋
Except last time, the gun was to my head.

143
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,170
他不会杀我的 James
He wouldn't have killed me, James.

144
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,744
我上次告诉你的那个洞穴
That cave I told you about,

145
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,824
就是写满了人名的那个 还记得么?
where all the names are written?

146
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:55,954
那里也刻着你的名字
Your name was there, too,

147
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,404
但被划掉了
But it was crossed out.

148
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,180
他不需要你了 Kate
He doesn't need you, Kate.

149
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,080
那么 是你妈在带她?
So she's with your mother?

150
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,970
嗯 你看过她的照片了? 怎么看见的?
Yes. You saw her pictures? How?

151
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,370
Widmore的人 在飞机上找到了你的照相机
Widmore's people found your camera on the plane.

152
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,110
他给我看了里面的相片
He showed me the pictures.

153
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,370
我们的女儿...
Our daughter...

154
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,200
她真漂亮
She's so beautiful.

155
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,750
你的戒指在我这儿呢
I have your ring.

156
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,720
啊哦
Uh-oh.

157
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,470
怎么了?
What happened?

158
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,920
谁把电关了? 到底怎么了?
Somebody shut us down? What's going on?

159
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,200
- 有人把电源切断了 - 快派一队人去发电机那儿!
- Somebody killed the power. - Get a team to that generator now!

160
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,110
我们死定了
And we're dead.

161
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,150
上! 上! 上!
Go! Go! Go!

162
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,330
啊!
Aah!

163
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,230
嘿
Hey.

164
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:57,121
我想我应该能够得着钥匙
I think I can reach the keys.

165
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:03,871
- 快点儿 等那东西解决了他们 就轮到我们了 - 我可受不了坐以待毙
- Hurry. When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us. - Well, I ain't waitin'.

166
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:06,561
啊!
Uhh!

167
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:07,501
该死的!
Damn it!

168
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,901
你来这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,751
我和他一起来的 快走
I'm with him. Come on.

170
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,452
离飞机还有多远?
How much further to the plane?

171
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,512
大概还有四分之一英里 翻过山就到了
I'd say about a quarter-mile, just over that ridge.

172
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:46,062
那么 你打算和我们一起走了?
So you're coming with us now?

173
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,112
我会送你们去飞机那儿 但我不登机
I'm gonna take you to the plane, but I'm not getting on it.

174
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:52,282
抱歉 Kate 我...
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm...

175
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:55,592
我不想走
I'm not meant to go.

176
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:01,822
谢谢你回来救我们 感激涕零
Thanks for coming back for us, doc. Appreciate it.

177
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,910
别开枪
No, it's okay.

178
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,450
Sayid不是坏人 发电机就是他关掉的
Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators.

179
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,810
那敢情好 多多益善
Great. The more the merrier.

180
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,480
我们该走了 Locke在等着呢
We need to go. Locke's waiting.

181
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,840
您是Cooper先生的亲戚么?
Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?

182
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,610
呃 不 我不是 但是...
Uh, no. No, I'm not, but...

183
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,580
我... 可以问问您所来何事么?
M... may I ask the nature of the visit?

184
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:34,741
- 呃... - Shephard医生?
- Um... - Dr. Shephard?

185
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:36,181
嘿
Hey.

186
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:37,971
您来这儿有事?
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,931
呃 我来找Anthony Cooper
Um, I'm here to see Anthony Cooper.

188
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,761
你认识他吗? 你也是来找他的?
Do you know him? Is that why you're here, too?

189
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,610
您找Anthony干嘛?
What do you want with Anthony?

190
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,190
我想找他谈谈
I wanna talk to him

191
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,910
他和Locke先生出的那场事故
about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke.

192
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,250
呃 Shephard医生...
Um, Dr. Shephard...

193
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,100
您还是走吧
Just go.

194
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,880
听我说 我只是想帮他而已
Look, all I wanna do is help him.

195
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,250
我知道 John跟我说过手术的事
I know. John told me about the operation.

196
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,370
他不想做
He doesn't want it.

197
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,870
为什么他不想做?
Why doesn't he want it?

198
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,550
拜托 Shephard医生 请您别管这事了
Please, Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,340
您救了John的命
You saved John's life.

200
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,030
为何不能就此收手?
Why can't that be enough?

201
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,340
因为还没到收手的时候
Because it's not.

202
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,180
家政服务 请拨23
Housekeeping, dial 23.

203
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,510
家政服务 分机号23
Housekeeping, extension 23.

204
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,400
嗨
Hi.

205
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,600
这就是Anthony Cooper
This is Anthony Cooper.

206
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,670
他是John的父亲
He's John's father.

207
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,850
喂! 停下!
Hey! Stop!

208
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,860
快在那停下!
Stop right there!

209
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,170
好 就是这了
Well, all righty.

210
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,050
我们来看看怎么让这家伙飞起来
Let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly.

211
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,780
这混蛋
Son of a bitch.

212
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,350
他的脖子断了
His neck's been broken.

213
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,720
那是我弄断的
That's because I broke it.

214
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,510
说些让你们觉得安慰的话
If it's any consolation,

215
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,640
Widmore早知道我会杀了这些人
Widmore knew that I would kill these men.

216
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,750
- 你说什么? - 他们守着这飞机 只不过是装装样子而已
- What are you talking about? - They were only guarding the plane for show.

217
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,080
如果Charles真的打算
If Charles had really wanted

218
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,960
阻止我登机
to keep me from actually getting on board,

219
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,820
他就不会撤掉防御
he wouldn't have moved his little fences.

220
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,880
等等 那他现在是想让我们离开这座岛?
Well, wait. Now he wants us to leave the island?

221
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,231
不是的 Hugo 他是想在同一个地方同一时间
No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place

222
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,331
抓住我们所有人...
at the same time...

223
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,921
这飞机条件绝佳 空间又小 我们根本没希望逃出去
A nice, confined space we have no hope of getting out of.

224
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,591
他可以把我们一网打尽
And then he wants to kill us.

225
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,171
- 用什么杀了我们? - 就用这个
- Kill us with what? - With this.

226
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,818
4块塑胶炸弹
4 bricks of C4.

227
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,468
我在飞机一个行李架上发现它们的
I found 'em in one of the overhead compartments,

228
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,498
它们与飞机的电路系统相连
wired to the electrical system of the plane.

229
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,698
如果我们打开电路...
If we would've turned it on...

230
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,028
轰
Boom.

231
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,868
那现在怎么办?
So what now?

232
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,790
我们无法确定 飞机上是否还有其它炸药
We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane.

233
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,780
这样登机不安全 如果我们打算离开这岛
It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island,

234
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,240
我想我们只能乘坐潜艇
I think we have to take the submarine.

235
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,220
- 我就说嘛 - 兄弟 等等
- Well, that's what I've been sayin' all along. - Dude, wait.

236
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,760
他并不打算离开这个岛
He's not supposed to leave the island.

237
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,320
- 我是说 Alpert是这么说的... - 去他的Alpert 他又不在这
- I mean, Alpert said... - Screw Alpert. He ain't here.

238
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,990
你救了我们两次
That's twice you've saved our asses.

239
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,780
我想是我误会你了
Guess I was wrong about you.

240
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,310
谢谢 James
Thank you, James.

241
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,490
那潜艇应该有重兵把守
That submarine is gonna be heavily defended.

242
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,280
只要我们都在 一切不成问题
We're gonna need everyone.

243
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,600
我会帮你 但如我之前所说 我不会和你走的
I'll help you, but like I said, I'm not going with you.

244
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,320
可以
Fair enough.

245
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,410
我们走吧
Let's go.

246
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,430
嗨
Hey.

247
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,860
- 我... 我很抱歉 我... - 没关系 Claire
- I... I'm sorry that I... - That's all right, Claire.

248
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,480
我理解你为什么跟他们一边
I understand why you went with them.

249
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,010
喂 医生 听着
Hey, doc, listen up.

250
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,630
你不想离开这岛
You don't wanna leave this island,

251
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,160
那是你他妈自己的事
that's your own damn business.

252
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,040
但我还想要你帮最后一次忙
But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.

253
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
我一点也不相信那个东西
I don't trust that thing one bit,

254
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,500
所以我需要你帮帮我
so here's what I need you to do.

255
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,190
当我们到了码头
Once we get to the dock,

256
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,870
你要保证那东西上不了潜艇
you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.

257
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,750
我应该怎么做? 你刚刚也看到了它的能耐
How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there.

258
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,580
把它弄到水里去 其它的我来搞定
Just get it in the water. I'll take care of the rest.

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
Locke先生 你醒了吗?
Mr. Locke, are you awake?

260
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,130
按下按钮
Push the button.

261
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,060
Locke先生 你听到我说话吗?
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

262
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,270
我希望你能相信我的话
I wish you had believed me.

263
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,900
打扰下?
Excuse me?

264
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,210
Littleston小姐?
Ms. Littleton?

265
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,060
Shephard医生 我... 我正在找你
Dr. Shephard. I... I was just looking for you.

266
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,470
那个 嗯 那个律师告诉我 你在这工作
The, um, the lawyer told me you work here.

267
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,270
嗯 我们... 可以聊聊吗?
Um, c... can we talk?

268
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,720
当然 当然
Yes. Yes.

269
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
噢 不用了 没事
Oh. No. I'm okay.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,990
抱歉 前几天
Sorry I had to run out

271
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,020
宣读... 遗嘱的时候 我却离场了
of the... the will reading the other day,

272
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,380
- 因为我得做一个紧急手术 而且... - 噢 别... 别担心
- but I did have an emergency and... - Oh. N... no worries.

273
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,100
嗯 我知道你跟我一样 觉得很别扭
Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me.

274
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,410
我甚至从没见过那个男人
I never even met this man.

275
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,560
不管怎样吧 啊 那个律师把这个给我了
Anyway, the, uh, the lawyer gave me this.

276
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,900
她说 嗯 还有其它的东西要给我
She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come,

277
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,150
但这是我父亲特意想要我拿着的
but that my father especially wanted me to have this.

278
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,640
你知道为什么
You know why

279
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,430
或者这是什么意思吗?
or what it's supposed to mean?

280
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
我不知道
I have no idea.

281
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,020
而且...
But then...

282
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,630
我... 我也不了解你
I... I didn't know about you, either.

283
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,890
我们的父亲 啊...
Our father, uh...

284
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,270
若果你... 不介意 我可以知道他是怎么死的吗?
You mind... you mind if I ask how he died?

285
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,260
在悉尼某酒吧外的小巷里 有人发现他横尸在那儿
He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney.

286
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,550
他是因为酗酒致死
He drank himself to death.

287
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,950
我飞到悉尼 把他的遗体运回来
I flew down to bring his body back,

288
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,400
但是后来 嗯... 那趟航班把它遗失了
but then, uh... the airline lost it.

289
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,910
我前几天刚从悉尼飞回来
I just flew in from Sydney few days ago.

290
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,400
什么时候?
When?

291
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,050
嗯 上周三
Uh, last Wednesday.

292
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
大洋航空815?
Oceanic flight 815?

293
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,540
啊... 是的
Uh... Yeah.

294
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,290
你介意我看看那个吗?
Do you mind if I have a look at that?

295
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,780
当然不 你看吧
Um, sure. Go ahead.

296
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,010
很抱歉 我... 我也希望我知道为什么他要你拿着这个
I'm sorry. I... I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this.

297
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,660
我...
I...

298
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,330
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Me too.

299
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,380
那么 嗯 很高兴再见到你
Well, um, it was nice seeing you again.

300
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,000
嗯...

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,400
谢谢你尝试帮我
Thanks for trying to help.

302
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,300
你现在住哪?
Where are you staying?

303
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,830
啊 就在街尾的... 汽车旅馆
Uh, just down the road... a motel.

304
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,050
为什么不搬过来和我一起住?
Why don't you come stay with me?

305
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,890
和你一起住?
Stay with you?

306
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,940
我是说 我们... 我们还是陌生人
I mean, we're... we're strangers.

307
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,780
不 我们不是陌生人 我们...
No, we're not strangers. We're...

308
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,970
我们是一家人
We're family.

309
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,750
码头上没有守卫
Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock

310
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,460
不能说明潜艇里也没有
doesn't mean they ain't on the sub.

311
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,510
我们有场硬仗要打 知道吗?
We're going in hard. Got it?

312
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,920
Lapidus Hugo Jin Sun... 你们和我一起
Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun... you're with me.

313
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,070
其他人等30秒 然后跟着我们向码头前进
The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us.

314
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,190
你俩殿后 没问题吧?
You think you two can get our backs?

315
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,540
当然
Absolutely.

316
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,420
好吧
All right.

317
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,940
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

318
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,048
先是发动机房
After engine room,

319
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:09,248
然后再给底舱动力
power the bilges.

320
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:11,758
请先给发动机房动力 然后是底舱
After engine room, power the bilges, please.

321
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,038
船长在哪?
Where's the damn captain?

322
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,950
举起手来
Put your damn hands up.

323
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,760
抱歉 无关私怨
Nothin' personal.

324
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,870
嗯 Hoss 你来准备发动这个东西 怎样?
Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up?

325
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,460
我来
I got it.

326
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:45,860
我们上
Let's go.

327
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,450
你确定你不再重新考虑下 Jack?
You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?

328
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,580
是 我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

329
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,180
告诉你 你得留下来的人
Whoever told you you needed to stay

330
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,460
根本不知道他们在说什么
had no idea what they were talking about.

331
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,870
John Locke告诉我 我得留下来
John Locke told me I needed to stay.

332
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,390
怎么了?
What happened?

333
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,540

我们快走!
Let's go now!

337
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,800
上面是怎么了?
What's going on up there?

338
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,190
怎么了?
What happened?

339
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,050
Widmore的人打中了她
Widmore's people shot her.

340
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,850
Hurley... Hurley 给我急救药箱
Hurley... Hurley, I need a first aid kit.

341
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,150
- 还有谁在上面? - Claire

342
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,590

Lapidus 如果你听到的话...
Lapidus, if you can hear me...

345
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,240
下潜! 下潜!
Dive! Dive!

346
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,240
开动了!
Let's go!

347
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,210
嗨!
Hey!

348
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,110
Claire! Claire 等! 等! 等!
Claire! Claire, wait! Wait! Wait!

349
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,780
Claire! Claire 等下!
Claire! Claire. Wait!

350
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,640
你在搞什么玩意?
What the hell are you doing?

351
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,050
我们来这里就是为这个... 离开这里
What we came here to do... leaving.

352
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,200
- 没事了 没事了 - 不!
- It's all right. It's all right. - No!

353
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,550
他们抛弃我们了!
They're leaving us!

354
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,890
不 相信我 没上潜艇 你不会后悔的
No, trust me. You don't want to be on that sub.

355
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,200
- Claire啊 - Kate
- Claire? - Kate.

356
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,740
- Claire? Claire在哪里? - 她还在上面呢
- Claire? Where's Claire? - She's still up there.

357
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,990
- 不 我们不能丢下她 我们不能... - Kate呀 Kate
- No, we can't leave without her. We can't... - Kate. Kate.

358
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,680
- 她会好起来的吗? - Jack 我找不到急救药箱 兄弟
- Is she gonna be okay? - Jack, I can't find the first aid kit, dude.

359
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,890
Jin... 我的包
Jin... my pack.

360
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,830
那里或许有条衬衫什么的 我可以用它来止血
There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure.

361
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,460
没事的 放轻松些 一切都会好起来的
It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be all right.

362
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,360
给你 你可以救她吗?
Here. Can you help her?

363
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,110
我想子弹
I think the bullet

364
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,760
- 穿透了... - 穿透什么了?
- went straight through... - What?

365
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,370
哥们 那玩意哪儿来的?
Dude, where'd that come from?

366
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Locke放的
Locke.

367
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,370
我们正中他的下怀
We did exactly what he wanted.

368
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,570
- 我们必须到回到水面上去 - 都白忙活了?
- We have to get to the surface. - What the hell?

369
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,310
我们必须马上回到水面上去!
We have to get to the surface now!

370
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,380
Lapidus 带我们上水面
Lapidus, take us up.

371
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,660
我们正在下潜呀!
We're divin'!

372
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,720
照办吧!
Just do it!

373
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,310
你听到他了吧 上去!
You heard him. Up!

374
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,540
- 哥们 那个玩意是怎么到潜艇上的? - Locke把它放我包里了
- Dude, how'd that get on the sub? - Locke put it in my pack.

375
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,400
他为什么要那样做? 他原本都想跟我们一起走的
Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us.

376
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,400
他确实想了 那就是我为什么要把他赶出去
You're damn right he did. That's why I shut his ass out.

377
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,100
他就是想让你把他赶出去 有人知道这个东西的工作原理吗?
He wanted you to shut him out. Any idea how that thing works?

378
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,800
- 我们可以把它关掉吗? - 这个表是与电池连接的
- Can we turn it off? - This watch is jury-rigged to the battery.

379
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,310
- 电池会引爆炸弹 - 还有多久才能浮上水面 Frank?
- The battery detonates the explosives. - How much time till we're up, Frank?

380
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,980
至少还有五分钟
At least five minutes.

381
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,390
我们没有那么多时间 接下来该怎么办 Sayid?
We ain't got five minutes. What's it gonna be, Sayid?

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,620
这些线... 是从表上引出来的
These wires... they're leads from the watch.

383
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,930
如果我们将线从电池上切断
If we disconnect them from the battery,

384
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,940
- 理论上讲 炸弹就会失效了 - "理论上"?
- technically speaking, the bomb should be inert. - "Technically"?

385
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,750
是的 但是你需要同时将它们全部拉出来
Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously,

386
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,110
- 我无法确定... - 靠边站
- and I'm not sure... - Step aside.

387
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,380
- 别 等下 等等 - 你这是要干什么了 医生?
- No, wait. Wait. - What the hell are you doing, doc?

388
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,120
啥事也不会发生的
Nothing's gonna happen.

389
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,150
- 什么? - 别把那些线拽出来
- What? - Don't pull those wires out.

390
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,830
没事的 一切都会好好的
We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen.

391
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,580
如果我不扯出这些线 Locke会把我们炸到
If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us

392
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,240
- 天国去的 - 不 他不会的 Locke不会杀掉我们的
- to kingdom come. - No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.

393
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,630
呃... 什么?
Uh... What?

394
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,900
这就是他想要的 这就是他一直所期待的
This is what he wanted. This is what he's been waiting for.

395
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,650
他就是费尽心机把我们聚在这里
Everything that he has done has been to get us here.

396
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,380
他就是想要我们
He wanted to get us all in the same place

397
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,800
聚在一起... 在一个封闭的场所
at the same time... a nice enclosed space

398
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,550
- 一个我们都无法逃生的地方 - 我不明白
- where we had no hopes of getting out of. - I don't understand.

399
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,050
Locke说过 没有我们 他无法离开这个岛
Locke said that he can't leave the island without us.

400
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,040
我觉得 他的确无法离开这个岛
I think that he can't leave the island

401
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,940
除非我们都死了
unless we're all dead.

402
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,930
他告诉过我 他可以随时杀掉
He told me that he could kill any one of us

403
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,920
我们中的任何一个人 那么到现在他还没有动手
whenever he wanted, so what if he hasn't

404
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,980
是因为他... 他还不能这样做?
because he's... he's not allowed to?

405
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,930
如果他是想要我们自相残杀呢?
What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?

406
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,590
别挡着我 医生
Stay out of my way, doc.

407
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:28,971
现在 如果他想要那个炸弹爆炸
Now if he wanted that thing to blow up,

408
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:32,061
- 那为什么还放个计时器呢? 为什么不直接把它丢进来就好了? - 我不关心这些
- Why would he put a timer in it? Why not just throw it inside? - I don't care.

409
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:34,201
- 不会有事发生的 - 这事不是你说了算
- Nothing is gonna happen. - It's not your decision to make.

410
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:36,581
- 他杀不了我们! - 我是不会在这里坐以待毙的!
- He can't kill us! - I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!

411
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:37,871
James啊...
James...

412
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,101
我们不会有事的
We are going to be okay.

413
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:44,951
你只需要相信我就好
You just have to trust me.

414
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,360
对不起 医生 我做不到
Sorry, doc, I don't.

415
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,800
仔细听着 在主岛上有口井
Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island

416
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,070
就在我们刚刚离开的营地 往南半英里的地方
a half mile south from the camp we just left.

417
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,080
Desmond被困在里面 Locke想杀掉他
Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead,

418
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,080
也就是说 你们有用得着他的地方 明白吗?
which mean you're going to need him. Do you understand me?

419
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,380
你告诉我这些干什么?
Why are you telling me this?

420
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,230
因为下一个就轮到你了 Jack
Because it's going to be you, Jack.

421
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,230
Sayid啊
Sayid!

422
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,000
喔 天呐
Oh, hell.

423
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,240
呃!
Uhh!

424
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,690
- 你还好吗? - 发生什么事了? Sayid刚才有没有...
- Are you okay? - What happened? Did Sayid just...

425
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,740
救命呀!
Help!

426
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,830
- Sun! - 救命呀!

427
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,700

428
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,670
- 坚持下 我会把你救出来的 - Jin!
- Hold on. I'll get you out. - Jin!

429
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,390
不!
No!

430
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,120
- Sawyer! 我需要帮助! - Jin!
- Sawyer! I need help! - Jin!

431
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,400
Hurley啊

432
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,640
Hurley啊

433
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,340
你带Kate离开这里
You gotta take Kate outta here.

434
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,420
- 那其他人怎么办? - 我会照顾他们的!
- What about everybody else? - I'll take care of them!

435
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,790
我必须找到Sayid!
I have to go after sayid!

436
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,330
再没有Sayid了!
There is no Sayid!

437
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,080
听我说 带着这个氧气瓶
Listen to me. Take this tank

438
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,540
你俩换着用 游到爆裂口那里去 行吗?
and buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole, okay?

439
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,830

440
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,760

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,010

我去看你父亲了
I went to see your father.

490
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,740
什... 什么?
W... what?

491
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,980
当你拒绝做手术的时候
When you didn't want the surgery,

492
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,780
我感觉我应该去寻找问题根源
I felt like I had to understand why, and, uh, you know,

493
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,290
我想 如果我能弄清楚你因何会坐上轮椅
I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair,

494
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,390
- 那也许就... - 我是因为坠机 才坐上轮椅的
- that maybe... - I was in a plane crash.

495
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,310
我拿到... 私人飞行员执照大概一周后
I had had my... my private pilot's license for a week,

496
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,860
嗯 我恳求我父亲当我第一个正式乘客
and, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger.

497
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
他有飞行恐惧症
He was terrified of flying.

498
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,640
但是我看着他的眼睛
But I looked him right in the eye

499
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,160
告诉他说 我能行的
and I told him he could trust me.

500
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,020
可我们只不过刚离开地面
And we barely got off the ground.

501
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,080
我... 我仍然记不起...
I... I still don't re...

502
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,600
我记不得我做错了什么
I don't remember what I did wrong,

503
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,920
但是那是我的错 都是我的错
but it was my fault. It was my fault

504
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,490
这个我深爱至极的男人
that this man who I loved more than anything

505
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,040
将再也无法行走... 或是说话...
will never walk or... talk or...

506
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,420
你知道的 我跟你第一次见面的时候
you know, the first time you and I met, um,

507
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,660
在机场... 的后面...
back at the... at the airport...

508
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,760
你告诉我 我的父亲已经永离尘世了
you told me that my father was gone,

509
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,240
说实话 呃
and, uh,

510
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,540
听到那我很伤心 但我知道你是对的
it hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right.

511
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,560
你的父亲也已经无力回天了 Locke先生
Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.

512
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,640
- 不 不 他不会的 - 嗯 他... 他的情况的确如此
- Uh, no, no, he's not. - Yes, he... he is,

513
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,340
无论你再怎么自责
and you can punish yourself as much as you want,

514
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,280
也不能让他回到从前
and that's never gonna bring him back.

515
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,370
事已至此了
What happened, happened,

516
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,760
那么...
and...

517
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,210
你别再纠结过往了
you can let it go.

518
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,360
别再纠结过往 你怎会以为如此简单?
What makes you think letting go is so easy?

519
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,480
不是的
It's not.

520
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
事实上 我也不知该怎么做 真的
In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself.

521
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,850
这就是我为什么希望...
And that's why I was hoping that...

522
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,430
也许你可以给我做个榜样
maybe you could go first.

523
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,850
再见了 Shephard医生
Good-bye, Dr. Shephard.

524
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,110
John 我能帮你的
I can help you, John.

525
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,550
我希望你相信我
I wish you believed me.

526
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,300
Jack啊
Jack.

527
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,480
我以为找不到你了
I couldn't find you.

528
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,810
我以为找不到你了
I couldn't find you.

529
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,670
- 他还好吧? - 他的头部受到强烈撞击
- Is he okay? - He got hit in the head pretty hard,

530
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,800
但是他还活着
but he's breathing.

531
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,300
Jin和Sun怎么样了?
What about Jin and Sun?

532
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,290
它沉下去了
It sunk.

533
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,260
什么 那个... 潜艇?
What, t... the submarine?

534
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,220
但是... 他们... 他们全都在上面
But... they... they were all on it.

535
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,260
所有人
Everyone.

536
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:14,020
- 他们... 他们都死了吗? - 不是所有的人
- What they're... they're all dead? - Not all of them.

537
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,680
等等 你... 你去哪?
Wait. W... where you going?

538
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,890
为我所做的事情 去画上句号

To finish what I started.
