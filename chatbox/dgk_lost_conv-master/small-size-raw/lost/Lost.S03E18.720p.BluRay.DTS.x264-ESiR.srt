他说他也就是个囚犯

141
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:42,040

他才不会这么做

我以为Locke已经用电磁防御系统杀了他了

如果不能吸入空气,她会死的

好吧  你干吧  帮帮她

你已经去世了

222
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:05,099
他为什么要这么说?
Why would he say that?

223
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,054
为了不让大家知道他家庭的耻辱

224

这就是你为什么要告诉他...

她把孩子留给了我

00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:47,036
我独自把他抚养大
I raised him alone.

230
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:51,047
我甚至都不确定他是我的孩子
I wasn't even sure I was the father.

231
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:57,039
但还有谁会肯照顾他呢?

232
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:15,035

不要和他说你来见过我...

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,021
还有他母亲还活着

236
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,078
求你了...
Please...

237
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,040

别让他为了这耻辱而受苦

00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,014
别出声
be quiet.

241
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,084
别动
be quiet.

242
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,047
你想我帮你和你的孩子吗?

245
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:25,048
如果你说的是实话,那我早就死了
if what you said was true,that means I'm already dead.

246
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,002
我干嘛还要跟你去?
Why should I go anywhere with you?

247
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:31,016
因为你还是有希望的
Because there may be hope for you yet.

248
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:56,080
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

249
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,049
这附近有个医疗站,那里有超声波仪器
There's a medical station near here.They have an ultrasound machine

250
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,094
Claire和Kate告诉过我那个地方

251
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:06,056
那里已经被遗弃了.什么都找不到
It was abandoned.They found nothing there.

252
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:10,012
那是因为他们不知道要找哪里
Well,that's because they didn't know where to look.

253
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:13,041
你要对我做什么?
What are you going to do to me?

254
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,065
我要检查你肚子里的孩子D.O.C...
I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the D.O.C.--

255
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,000
怀孕的日期
Um,date of conception.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,051
超声波仪器会告诉我们你是几时怀孕的  误差在1天内
The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant,give or take a day.

257
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:29,083
如果你是在岛外怀孕的,那你和你的孩子就会没事的
If you got pregnant off the island,then you and your baby will probably be okay,

258
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,043
但如果你是在这里怀孕的...
but if you got pregnant here...

259
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:38,069
到时候再想办法吧
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

260
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,086
你和你丈夫最近一次做爱是什么时候?
When was the last time you and your husband had sex?

261
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,042
我情愿不回答你的问题
I would rather not talk about that.

262
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:46,081
我知道这是隐私  但如果我知道是什么时候  我可以...
Look,I know that it's personal,but if I know when,then I can figure--

263
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,062
那个机器不是能告诉我们吗?
isn't that what the machine will do?

264
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,098
当然
Yeah.

265
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,097

Then let's keep walking.

为了什么?
What for?

277

我不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

278
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,027
你不给我一个解释,我怎么能给你钱?
Why should I give you money without an explanation?

279
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,093
因为我一生...
Because my whole life...

280
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:20,032
都假装不知道你在做什么
...I've pretended not to know what you do.

281
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,096
一直好好的听从你
I've allowed you to keep your control over me.

282
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:28,013
我假装一切都很好
I pretend that everything is all right.

283
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,096
我会继续这样装下去
I will continue pretending.

284
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:37,025
只要你给我这笔钱
As long as you give me the money I am asking for.

285
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,023
别问我理由

00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:47,045
这世界上人人都有发问的权力!
We do not live in a world where there are no questions asked!

287
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:52,050
我这么做是为了让我深爱的人远离耻辱
I'm doing this to spare someone I love deep shame.

288
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,033
你的丈夫?

他不再是部门经理了

292
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,083
他将为我工作

你们对这个女人还了解多少?

00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:02,094
除了信号枪她还有什么?

一本书  还有个无线电,电话什么的...

296

306
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,085
这样...正常吗?
is that... normal?

307
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:48,077
纱布
gauze.

308
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:53,038
小心的包扎起来
Tape it. Be careful.

309
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,074
不要太紧了
The covering needs to be hollow.

310
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:59,004
伤口需要透气
The wound needs to breathe.

311
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,040
她说了什么?
what did she say?

312
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,049
"谢谢"
"Thank you."

313
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,080
她说"谢谢你们救了我"
She said,"thank you for helping me."

314
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,064
就在这下面
It's right down here.

315
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,020
你为什么要这么做?
why are you doing this?

316
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,027
什么?
What?

317
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:30,075
帮助我
Helping me.

318
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:41,058
从前...
Once upon a time,

319
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,051
我告诉别人他们怀孕时
I told women that they were pregnant,

320
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:48,036
他们的表情告诉我...
and their faces...

321
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:55,096
这是他们一生中听到最好的消息
it was the best news they ever got in their entire life.

322
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:59,010
然而我到了这里
Then I came here.

323
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:06,081
在过去的3年里...
in the last three years.

324
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:10,048
我们失去了9位病人
I've lost...nine patients...

325
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,002
我帮助你是因为我想告诉你...
I'm helping you because I want to tell you

326
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:20,075
你是在来这之前怀孕的
that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here.

327
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:28,010
我帮助你是因为我想告诉你好的消息
I'm helping you because I want to give good news again.

328
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:36,085
我和其他男人上床了...
I slept with another man...

329
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:43,039
在来这里之前
Before we got to the island.

330
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:49,021
Jin和我...
Jin and I,we were having...

331
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:54,041
遇到了些麻烦,我们没有...
trouble.We weren'T...

332
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,046
我有一个朋友
and I had a friend.

333
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:10,012
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

334
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:14,055
我们都会犯错
We all make mistakes.

335
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:20,063
哪边走?
Which way?

336
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,078
能帮我挪一下吗?
will you help me move this forward?

337
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,090
好了
good.

338
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:32,082
为什么这个房间被隐藏起来了?
why is this room hidden?

339
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,027
别担心
Don't worry about it.

340
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:38,068
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

341
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:42,018
告诉我
Tell me.

342
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:47,059
我们把要死的女人都带来这里
It's where we brought the women to die.

343
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,055
她没事
She's fine.

344
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:57,083
尽量保持伤口的清洁
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

345
00:28:57,084 --> 00:29:00,037
一天后她会好起来的
She should be better in a day.

346
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,060
一天?
A day?

347
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,091
她的肺被刺穿了
Her lung was punctured.

348
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:07,070
这座岛上的  自然规律有些不同
On this island,the rules are a bit different.

349
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:11,029
也许一天半
Maybe a day and a half.

350
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,085
我做了该做的
I did as I promised.

351
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,050
她会活下来的
She will live.

352
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:23,009
-你不会真的放他走吧    -你走吧
- You can't seriously be considering letting him go. - Just go.

353
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,083
开什么玩笑?.他是他们的人!
Are you kidding?He's one of them!

354
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:27,011
我又能怎么做Charlie?
So what would you have me do,charlie?

355
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,098
我们得做个担架来抬她走
We've t to make a stretcher and carry her.

356
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,047
你想让我再带上个囚犯吗?
How are we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?

357
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:33,017
-给我根绳子  -责任由我来负
- Give me some rope. - I'll take responsibility.

358
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,064
电话  电话!
Phone. Phone!

359
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,032
-Jin等等!  -电话!
- Wait,jin! - Phone!

360
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,011
-没关系的Jin! 
-不  让他去吧!

361
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:42,032
-快回来Jin!    -让他去追吧!
- Jin,come back here! - Oi,let him!

362
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:44,076
-没关系的Jin! Jin! -电话!
- Jin,it's all right! -  no,let him!

363
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:46,013
Jin让他走吧
Jin,let him go!

364
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,058
Jin让他走吧!
Jin,let him go!

365
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,084
电话!
Phone!

366
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:58,018
是你偷走的?
You stole this?

367
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:00,069
不试试怎么知道?
How could you respect me if I didn't try?

368
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,036
要不要弄瞎你另一只眼睛?
How about I take your other eye?

369
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,028
你会试试吗?
Would you respect that?

370
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,099
抱歉  我...
Sorry. I--

371
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,077
住手Charlie!
charlie,don't!

372
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,057
Charlie!
Charlie!

373
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,079
Charlie让他走吧!
Charlie,let him go!

374
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,097
这是一个错误!
This is a mistake!

375
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:12,040
我们不能就这么放了他!
We can't keep letting these people go!

376
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,043
我保证过他!
We gave him our word!

377
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,074
走吧
Go on.

378
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:28,089
滚远点
Get out of here.

379
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:53,031
这不是Jin的孩子
the baby isn't jin'S.

380
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:59,027
我们在韩国试着生孩子,但我们不能
We tried to have a baby back in korea and couldn'T.

381
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:02,052
医生告诉我...
And the doctor...

382
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,069
Jin他不能生育
he told me jin was infertile.

383
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,058
然后你来了这里
And then you came here.

384
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,008
什么?
What?

385
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:16,041
你知道男人精子的平均数量是...
Did you know that the average male sperm count is

386
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,090
6到8千万?
between 60 and 80 million?

387
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:24,027
不过在这座岛上是那的5倍之多
But on this island,it's five times that.

388
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:28,018
这样的几率很高
We call that good odds.

389
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:31,071
准备好了吗?
you ready?

390
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:33,008
是的
Yes.

391
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,071
把你的上衣撩起来一点
Okay,you wanna lift up your shirt a little?

392
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:39,093
会有些凉
It's cold.

393
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,009
我能看见我的孩子吗?
will I see the baby?

394
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,015
也许吧
Maybe.

395
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:47,025
你只有3个月,所以还不能确定
It's your first trimester,so it's a little iffy.

396
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:49,065
如果你看不见心跳
if you don't see a heartbeat,

397
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:54,001
别担心  因为现在还早
don't worry about it.It's just early.

398
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:56,013
这是怎么工作的?
How does it work?

399
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,052
我测量一下胎儿
Well,I take a measurement

400
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,043
这就能告诉我
of the fetus,and that will tell us

401
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,090
你是什么时候受孕的
when your baby was conceived

402
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:07,043
我们就可以知道是谁的孩子了
and then we'll know who.

403
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:13,003
你还好吗?
are you okay?

404
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,002
我得到的都会是坏消息
I lose either way.

405
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,021
如果我能活下来...
If I'm going to live...

406
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:24,051
那就意味着这不是Jin的孩子
that means the baby's not jin'S.

407
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:28,019
你还想继续吗?
Do you still want to do this?

408
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:33,022
-是的-好吧
- Yes.- Okay.

409
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:36,086
真相的时刻
Moment of truth.

410
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,051
Kwon夫人
Mrs.Kwon

411
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:57,067
Kwon先生
Mr.Kwon

412
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,063
我听说你今天来过办公室
I heard you came by the office today.

413
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:07,077
怎么不来打个招呼?
Why didn't you come say hello?

414
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:10,041
我不想打扰你
I didn't want to bother you.

415
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:14,058
能见到你,永远都不会
Seeing you is never a bother.

416
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,050
下一次  我一定会来
Next time,i promise.

417
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,027
你去拿过信了吗?
Did you get the mail?

418
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:22,025
抱歉  我给忘了
Sorry,i forgot.

419
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,094
信箱钥匙在你那儿吗?
Do you have the mail key?

420
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:27,055
在我包里
It's in my purse.

421
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:33,020
Jin等等!
Jin!Wait!

422
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:39,089
这些钱是干什么的?
What's this money?

423
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,089
是...我父亲的
It's...from my father.

424
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:47,088
为什么?
Why?

425
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:51,013
我想为我们买些家具....
I wanted to get us furniture....

426
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:56,002
然后渡过一个美好的蜜月
And I wanted us to have a nice honeymoon.

427
00:33:57,084 --> 00:34:01,018
这些我都能给你
I can provide for you.

428
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,077
渡蜜月...家具,我知道还要些时间...
The honeymoon..the furniture.I know it will take longer...

429
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:11,087
但我会做到的,我能付得起的
but it will happen.And i will pay for it.

430
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:18,069
我会一直照顾你的Sun
I will always take care of you,Sun.

431
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:23,033
我知道
I know.

432
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,028
把这些还回去吧
Then give it back.

433
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:35,024
我欠你父亲够多的了
I don't want to be in your father's debt any more than we already are.

434
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,056
拜托了
Please.

435
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:45,064
Jin...
Jin...

436
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:49,002
我爱你
I love you.

437
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:55,011
-真的吗?  -真的
- Madly?- Madly?

438
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:22,025
在这里
there it is.

439
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:27,027
那是你的孩子,你看见了吗?
There's your baby.Can you see?

440
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,007
我看见了
I can see it.

441
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:35,039
是男孩还是女孩?
is it a boy or a girl?

442
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,008
这还为时过早
Oh,it's--it's a little early,

443
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:44,023
你看到这轻微的振动了吗?
but,um,do you see that little flutter?

444
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:48,054
那是心跳
that's the heart beating.

445
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:55,087
很强烈的心跳,胎儿很健康
it's very strong.It's very healthy.

446
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,095
好了
Okay.

447
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:05,060
你们的飞机是90天前坠毁的
you crashed here 90 days ago.

448
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:09,010
孩子大概是在8周前受孕的
The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago,

449
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:14,032
所以...是53天左右
so... around 53 days.

450
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:20,075
你是在这座岛上受孕的
you got pregnant on the island.

451
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:26,014
我很抱歉  我很抱歉Sun

我会尽力帮助你的
I will do everything that I can.

453
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:44,019
孩子是Jin的
it's jin'S.

454
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:10,079
还以为你不会来了
I was starting to think you wouldn't come.

455
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:26,019
你为什么不告诉我你是Jin的母亲?
Why didn't you tell me you were Jin's mother?

456
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:31,088
我把他生了下来,那也不能说我就是他的母亲
I gave birth to him.But hat doest not make me his mother.

457
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:37,055
你知道我们家族的权势有多大
You know how powerful my family is.

458
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:43,058
我丈夫以为你已经死了
My husband believes that you are dead.

459
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:48,062
别逼我让这真的发生
Do not force me to make that reality.

460
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,095
我还剩多少时间?
so how long do I have?

461
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:26,090
大多数孕妇都是在她们的第二个阶段(6个月)
Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester.

462
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:32,015
没人能撑过第三阶段(9个月)
