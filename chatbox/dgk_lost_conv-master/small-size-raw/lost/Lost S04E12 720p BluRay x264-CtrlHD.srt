4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,098
前面会有些风变
We got a little chop ahead.

5
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,044
拿开那个  不要吓唬我
Put that away, man. you're freaking me out.

6
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,096
我们需要这个东西
We need this thing.

7
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:26,086
我们载的这些人?
With the cargo we got back there?

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,022
太不吉利
Bad mojo.

9
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,005
-Decker小姐?  -什么事?
Ms. decker? yes?

10
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:34,034
-想通知下后面我们要着陆了吗?  -好的
Wanna head back there and let 'em know we're landing? sure. of course.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,011
我们要着陆了
We're coming in for a landing.

12
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:56,021
是在檀香山西部的一个军事基地
It's a military facility just west of honolulu.

13
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,076
是绝对机密的一个地方
It's completely private.

14
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:02,064
你们的--你们的家人已经来了
Your--your families are already here.

15
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:08,085
现在有很多新闻媒体想要采访你们
Now there's a lot of press that wanna speak to you,

16
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:10,088
但是据我所知大洋航空也关心说
But as far as oceanic is concerned,

17
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:13,045
你们不必接受记着的访问
You don't have to speak to any reporters.

18
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,084
我们可以接受访问
We'll talk to 'em.

19
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,069
你们也同意吗?
Is that all right with all of you?

20
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,017
没关系  我们都同意了
It's fine. we all agreed.

21
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,037
我们只是--只是想快点结束
We just--we just wanna get it over with.

22
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,024
好的
Okay.

23
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:36,016
他们把你们叫做"大洋航班六人"
Um, they're referring to you as the "oceanic six."

24
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:40,092
这个名字不是特别好  不过容易记
That's not the best branding as far as we're concerned, but it's catchy.

25
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,071
我们地面上见
We'll see you on the ground.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,013
我们都知道要怎么说了
We all know the story.

27
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,008
如果我们遇到一些不想回答的
If we get any questions that we don't wanna answer,

28
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,023
或者不能回答的问题  我们就不回答
Or that we can't answer, let's just keep our mouths shut.

29
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:11,065
没什么的  他们会...以为我们还惊魂未定
It's okay. they'll--they'll think that we're in shock.

30
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,009
我们确实还惊魂未定呢  Jack
We are in shock, jack.

31
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,041
那样就应该很容易忽悠过去了
Then this should be easy.

32
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,038
是Sayid和Desmond在直升机上  对吗?
It was sayid and--and desmond in the helicopter, right?

33
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:53,088
我是说  一定是他们
I mean, it had to be.

34
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,092
不然他们为什么把这个东西正好扔给我们?
Why else would they have dropped that thingamabob right over us?

35
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,086
那他们为什么不干脆在这着陆呢?
Then why wouldn't they just land?

36
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:02,033
我不知道  不过这个东西可以追踪直升机
I don't know, but this thing is trackin' the chopper.

37
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:04,073
所以如果是他们  他们是想我们知道他们的去向
So if they were on it, they want us to know where they're going.

38
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:10,030
那是个电话  对吗?  为什么不直接打过去?
It's a phone, right? can't we just call?

39
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,060
别耍花招
Don't try anything stupid.

40
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,006
明白
Understood.

41
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,065
-在那着陆  -是从直升机上传出来的吗?
Put it down over there. is that from the chopper?

42
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,036
-我们离目的地还有五公里  -我叫你着陆  Frank
We're still 5 klicks from the site. I said put it down, frank.

43
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,078
动作快点  伙计们
Okay, gear up, boys.

44
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:36,071
我们一着陆  即刻前往"兰花站"
Soon as we hit the ground, we deploy to the orchid.

45
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,090
加油  行动吧  
Heads down! let's do this.

46
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,063
你知道什么是"兰花站"吗?
You know what "the orchid" is?

47
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,065
不知道  我没听见Desmond和Sayid的声音
No. I didn't hear desmond or sayid either.

48
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:48,077
Kate
Kate.

49
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,088
-想走走吗?  -没问题
Wanna take a walk? absolutely.

50
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:58,036
-我去拿枪  你去取点水  好吗?  -好的
I'll get the guns. you get some water, okay? okay.

51
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:04,061
你在开玩笑吧  你刚动完手术  Jack
You can't possibly be serious. you just had surgery, jack.

52
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,055
-我没事的  -如果你的缝合处裂开  那就难办了
I'm gonna be fine. if your sutures rip, you're not gonna be fine.

53
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:09,043
-我不能只干坐在那等着  -是恢复不是"干坐着"!
I can't just sit around waiting. recovery is not "sitting around"!

54
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,017
-听着　我一定要去  -为什么?
Look, I have to do this. why?

55
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,026
因为我承诺过会带他们离开这个岛的
Because I promised those people that I would get 'em off this island.

56
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,049
别流血过多至死  Jack
Don't bleed to death, jack.

57
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,051
我们几个小时后见
I'll see ya in a couple hours.

58
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,025
-怎么了?  -Charlotte  你没听到他说什么吗?
What's wrong? charlotte, did you hear what he said?

59
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:34,093
他们要去兰花站
They're going to the orchid.

60
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:38,019
-他们在执行第二方案  -你说什么?
They're using the secondary protocol. what are you talking about?

61
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,045
兰花站
The Orchid

62
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,099
我们必须得离开这个岛
We have to get off this island.

63
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,072
马上
Right now.

64
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,091
我们快赶上了
We're catchin' up.

65
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,090
直升机肯定已经着陆了
The chopper must've landed.

66
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,050
你干嘛不歇口气?
Why don't you take a break?

67
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,007
你在流血
You're bleeding.

68
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,051
不  我不是在流血  我是...
No, I'm not bleeding. I'm...

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,001
是在化脓  是...
I'm suppurating. it's...

70
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:45,061
流脓  我的身体正和伤口处的感染做斗争
Discharge. my body's just fightin' the infection around the stitches.

71
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:49,053
大多数人撒谎时是不敢正视别人眼睛的
You know when most people are lying and they can't look you in the eye?

72
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,078
你却完全相反
You do the exact opposite.

73
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,053
好久不见
Hey, long time no see.

74
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,009
成吉思汗  你在和谁说话?
Hey, who are you talkin' to up there, genghis?

75
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:32,084
Claire在哪?
Where's claire?

76
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:38,074
我们把她弄丢了
We lost her.

77
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,076
你什么?
You what?

78
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,033
她半夜的时候走了
She just walked off in the middle of the night.

79
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,086
我们找了她一天  不过找不到
We looked for her for a day, but she was just gone.

80
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:50,079
-我希望她也许回到海滩那里了  -她没有
I was hopin' maybe she went back to the beach. she didn't.

81
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:55,041
你们在这干什么?
Well, what are y'all doin' out here?

82
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:58,047
那个电话是干什么的?
What's that phone for?

83
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,067
直升机飞过了海滩  有人把这个扔下来了
The chopper flew over the beach. someone tossed this out.

84
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,093
肯定是Sayid
It must've been sayid.

85
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,060
你最好希望不是Sayid
Well, you better hope it ain't sayid,

86
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,092
因为如果他和那帮炸毁了一半"其他人"的基地的混蛋在一起
'cause if he's with those animals that just blew up half of new otherton,

87
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:13,083
-你就不用指望可以救他了  -什么  他们要杀你们?
You do not wanna tussle with 'em. what, they tried to kill you?

88
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,073
就像Locke说的  他们会的
Just like locke said they would.

89
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,076
那么...怎么样?
So... what?

90
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,047
我们就干脆...掉头回去然后躲起来?
We're supposed to just... turn around and hide?

91
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,040
因为似乎你已经被找到了
'cause it seems like that didn't work so well for you.

92
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,021
抱歉  医生  可能这是不怎么样
I'm sorry, doc, maybe this is daijobu.

93
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:31,055
可是你的"拿着对讲机在丛林里乱晃"的办法也不怎么好
But didn't you just do the whole "run through the jungle with a walkie" plan?

94
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,095
那个直升机是我们离开这个岛的唯一办法
That helicopter is our only way off this island.

95
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,043
你为什么这么执着要"离开这个岛"?
What's with you and "gettin' off the island"?

96
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,064
-天天TMD想着这件事  -别说了!
You're like a damn broken record. stop it!

97
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,086
你们俩现在是要打架啊?
Are you two fightin' each other now?

98
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,076
我让Sayid和Desmond去直升机上的
I put sayid and desmond on that chopper.

99
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:51,060
是我的决定  所以是我的责任
It was my call. it's my responsibility.

100
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,077
无论他们在不在那我都要去看看
I'm going after it whether they're on it or not.

101
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,045
你们都可以回去海滩那
You can all head back to the beach.

102
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:04,011
Jack...  不不不  你不能自己一个人去
Jack... no, no, no. you can't go by yourself.

103
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,023
照顾好小婴儿  好吗?
Take care of the baby. okay?

104
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,039
那个狗娘养的太固执了
That son of a bitch is stubborn.

105
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:23,015
等等!  别想自己去送死
Hold up! you don't get to die alone.

106
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,001
基于对遇难位置的分析
Based on the location of the wreckage,

107
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:34,006
最有可能的失事地点是...
Our best estimate of the crash site is...

108
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:39,053
这里  从那里  幸存者们被洋流带到了...  
Here. from there, the survivors were carried by the ocean's current to...

109
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:47,006
这里  巽他群岛里一个叫做Membata的无人小岛
Here-- an uninhabited island in the lesser sunda islands known as membata.

110
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,093
在你们的摘要手册里有  在第103天  
As you've all read in your briefing books, on day 103...

111
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:56,039
一场台风把一艘印尼的渔船残骸吹到了岛上
A typhoon washed up the remnants of an indonesian fishing boat,

112
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,075
包括基本的供给和一条救生筏
Including basic supplies and a survival raft.

113
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:04,033
第108天  剩下的六名幸存者  包括
On day 108, the remaining six survivors, including

114
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:09,059
Austen小姐在Membata岛上生下的孩子
Ms.Austen's baby which she gave birth to on the island of membata,

115
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,051
划着救生筏到了这里  一个叫做Sumba的岛
Used this raft to journey here-- an island called sumba.

116
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:18,030
他们然后在一个叫做Manukangga的村落附近上岸
They then came ashore near a village called manukangga.

117
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:21,091
这张照片是当地渔民找到他们时拍下的
This photo was taken by the local fisherman who found them.

118
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:25,026
查明他们身份之后
Once it was discovered who they were,

119
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:28,067
他们就马上被美国海岸警卫队转移到了檀香山
They were transported to honolulu by the u.s. coast guard.

120
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:33,075
你们都能想象得出  这是一次非凡的求生经历
As you can imagine, this has been an extraordinarily trying experience.

121
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,088
他们同意回答一些问题
They have, however, agreed to answer a few questions.

122
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,085
女生们先生们  有请大洋航班8-1-5的幸存者
So, ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of oceanic 8-1-5.

123
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,048
Shephard医生!  Shephard医生!
Yes. dr. shephard! dr. shephard!

124
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:48,089
你能回想一下飞机坠海那时的感受吗?
Can you tell us what it was like when the plane hit the ocean?

125
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,062
你是如何幸存下来的
Uh, how you survived.

126
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,016
一切  一切都发生得太快了
It--it all happened really fast.

127
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,061
我还记得当时刹那的冲击
I remember the impact.

128
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,083
我还记得飞机  慢慢地渗入海水
I remember the--the plane filling up with water.

129
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:07,023
我们几个跑到了逃生门那里  然后
A group of us got to the emergency door, and, um...

130
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,041
在沉下去之前逃了出去
Got out before it went down.

131
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:13,036
你们这些幸存下来的人  你们是游到岛上的吗?
And those of you who survived-- you swam to the island?

132
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,000
不是
No.

133
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,019
我们知道了垫子
We had, uh, cushions.

134
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,049
还有一些救生衣
We had some life jackets.

135
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:22,059
我们在水里快一天  然后洋流把我们带走了
We were in the water for over a day before the current took us in.

136
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:25,097
那时  只有我们八个人存活下来
By then, there was only eight of us left.

137
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,048
其他三个人呢
what happened to other three?

138
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,046
其中一个  他叫本·卡·莱尔
one of them, his name is boon ky lair

139
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:35,049
严重内伤  坠机三天后死亡

在直升机回到船上之前  我们必须得离开
We have to go right now before the helicopter gets back to the boat.

188
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:26,025
为什么我们要赶在直升机回去之前?
Why do we have to go to the boat before the chopper gets back?

189
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:30,060
飞机上的人打算杀了我们全部人

-什么  -Jack和Kate才跟着它而去

得小心翼翼

199
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,095
如果你可以随心所欲的移动这个岛
Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted,

200
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,099
为什么不在那些带着枪的疯子来之前就移动
Why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?

201
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:16,038
因为移动岛既危险又无法预料后果

202
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:20,034
这是最后一招
It's a measure of last resort.

你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

225
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,077
Jack以为你...  我知道他想什么呢

00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:22,010
哇  你们在这
Wow, you guys are here.

290
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,087
派对主题选得很有趣
Interesting choice of theme.

291
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:28,095
我妈...不太理解我们的感受(又回到岛上了  哈哈)
Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, dude.

292
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:30,065
大家都怎么样啊
Hey! how's everybody doing?

293
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:31,096
你们在谈什么
What are you talking about?

294
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,097
生火或是猎杀野猪?
Building a fire or huntin' boars?

295
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,052
我猜不是
I guess not.

296
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:39,023
你们介意我们失陪一会儿吗
Uh, listen. uh, do you mind, uh, excusing us for a little while?

297
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:41,080
给你看看我为你准备的生日礼物
I-i wanna show you your birthday present. hmm?

298
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:44,036
来吧  再见
Come on. bye-bye now.

299
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,009
我跟你说过我什么都不想要
I told you I don't want anything.

300
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:48,059
Hugo  这是你的生日  你一定要得到点什么
Hugo, it's your birthday. you gotta get somethin'.

301
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:51,023
不要和那些钱有关  我不想得到任何用那些钱买来的东西
Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.

302
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:54,014
放松  在你给我们那些钱之前我就准备好了
Relax. I got this before you gave us the money.

303
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,063
看看
Check it out.

304
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:04,082
你把它修好了
You fixed it.

305
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,065
对
Yeah.

306
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:10,031
空难之后  我修好它做为对你的怀念
After the crash, i-i worked on it as a memorial to you.

307
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,096
当我修它时  就好像我跟你在一起一样
When I was fixing it up, it was almost like I was with ya.

308
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,054
现在你回来了  这是你的了
But now you're back, and it's all yours.

309
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,069
想开出去兜兜风吗
Wanna take her for a little spin?

310
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,053
-有什么问题吗  儿子?  -这是个玩笑吗
Is somethin' wrong, son? is this some kind of joke?

311
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,071
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

312
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:46,014
4  8  15  16  23  42
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

313
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,065
你做的这些吗?
Did you do this?

314
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,073
-做什么啊?  -这就是那个号码!
Do what? those are the numbers!

315
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:53,011
就这个  我彩票的中奖号码
Right there! the numbers I won the lottery with!

316
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,067
-哇  真是个巧合  -不  不  这不是巧合
Wow. what--what a coincidence. no. no, not a coincidence.

317
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:57,077
我不想要这个
I don't want this.

318
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,066
-我不想要这个  -Hugo?
I don't want any of it! hugo?

319
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,019
等等  Hugo  你要...
Wait--wait a minute. hugo, what are you...

320
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,055
儿子!
Son! hey!

321
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,089
Hugo!  Hugo!
Hugo! hugo!

322
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:09,004
你要去哪儿  Hugo
Hugo, where you goin'? come on! hugo!

323
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:14,096
好的  假设这个温室像你说的一样
Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah,

324
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:18,007
既危险又不知道后果会怎样
I get it. it's really dangerous and unpredictable.

325
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:22,073
如果它起作用了  我们移动了这个岛
But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island.

326
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,021
是不是这就意味着那些带着枪的家伙也跟着移动
Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?

327
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:28,086
是的  我想他们也会跟着移动  这不就是个问题吗?
Yes, I suppose they would. well, isn't that, you know, a problem?

328
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,064
我正在想办法
I'm working on it.

329
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:32,073
那我怎么办  我还是想离开这个岛!
Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!

330
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:35,004
恐怕现在有点迟了  Hugo
I'm afraid it's a little late for that, hugo.

331
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:47,039
把望远镜给我好吗
May I have the binoculars, please?

332
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:51,083
你们最好蹲低一点
You might wanna get down lower to the ground.

333
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:54,007
为什么我们要那样做
And why might we wanna do that?

334
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,046
因为我们已经到兰花站了
Because we're at the orchid.

335
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,024
那我们还等什么?
What are we waitin' for?

336
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,072
我们之所以等  是因为Charles Widmore
We're waiting, john, because charles widmore,

337
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:17,066
那个想要抓住我  然后把你们都杀掉的人
The man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you,

338
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:20,061
他知道这个地方  知道里面有我们要的东西
Knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside.

339
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:25,079
你曾说过你不知道他为何想要找到这岛
I thought you said you had no idea why he was trying to find he island.

340
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:28,054
我当时说的不全是真话
I wasn't being entirely truthful.

341
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:31,027
是啊  你什么时候会全说真话呢
Yeah. when are you ever entirely truthful?

342
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:34,050
你得看看这个
You need to see this.

343
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,012
你要我看什么?
What am I looking for?

344
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:40,072
往左手边看
Look over there on the left-hand side.

345
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,030
朝后面植物的方向看
Watch the plants at the back.

346
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:52,042
-我没有看到任何...  -他们已经来了
I don't see any-- they're already here.

347
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,053
我们回来了
Hey, we're back!

348
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,032
Sayid呢?
Where's sayid?

349
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:35,034
他去追Jack了  你上
He had to go after jack. you go.

350
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,025
他们去追直升机了
They're headed for the chopper.

351
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:42,010
你还好吗?
You okay?

352
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,071
是的  我很好  谢谢
Yes, I'm fine. thank you.

353
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:50,075
我回去接下一批人
I'm gonna head back for the next group.

354
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,059
发动机修好了
Engine's fixed.

355
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,027
去叫Hendricks来试一下
Tell hendricks to try it.

356
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,028
好了  发动机应该能用了
Okay, engine should be working.

357
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:30,043
的确如此
Indeed they are.

358
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,076
好了  朝岛那边开
All right, well, take us to the island.

359
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:39,049
但你得确保是在3-0-5的方位开去
But make sure you--you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5.

360
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,041
必须得在3-0-5方位上
It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5.

361
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:45,088
看来有射频干扰回声测深仪
We've got some kind of r.f. interference with the the fathometer.

362
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,095
我看不到暗礁了  老兄
I can't see the reef, mate.

363
00:30:48,002 --> 00:30:49,027
射频干扰吗
R.f. interference?

364
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,090
怎么可能?  无线电已经出故障了
How is that possible? the radio room's down.

365
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:56,077
我不清楚  但是船上有什么东西在传送信号
I don't know, but something on this boat is broadcasting.

366
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,084
如果不把它关上
If we don't turn it off,

367
00:30:57,084 --> 00:31:00,029
我不会进入岛的5英里范围
I'm not going any closer than 5 miles off the coast.

368
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,015
那我去把它找出来
Then I'll find it.

369
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,064
刮胡子伤到的吗
Cut yourself shavin'?

370
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:17,036
两天前Juliet切了我的阑尾
Juliet took out my appendix a couple of days ago.

371
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:19,015
你耍我吧
You kiddin' me.

372
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,043
没有
Nope.

373
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,076
我还错过了什么呢?
Well, what else did I miss?

374
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,045
我们到了
We're here.

375
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:48,068
是Lapidus吗
Ah! lapidus!

376
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:50,080
是
Yeah!

377
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:53,021
你认识这混蛋吗
You know this yahoo?

378
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,039
是的
Yeah.

379
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,043
混蛋?
"yahoo"?

380
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:59,078
是我这个混蛋把电话丢出去  好让你们找到我...
This yahoo dropped that phone on you guys so you could find me...

381
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,010
然后带你们离开这里
And I could fly you outta here.

382
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:05,050
因此你为何不帮我一下?
So why don't you do me a favor and get that back compartment?

383
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,064
在后舱里有个工具箱
There's a toolbox.

384
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,047
看是否能找到有用的东西把我从这鬼东西弄出来
See if you can find something to get me outta these things.

385
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,089
照做吧
You heard the man.

386
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:14,056
我回来时要不要给你们带一杯可口的冰柠檬汁?
Can I get you boys a nice, cold glass of lemonade while I'm back there?

387
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,026
Desmond和Sayid在哪
Where are desmond and sayid?

388
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:18,040
你们的朋友很聪明  继续呆在船上
Your buddies were smart enough to keep their asses on

389
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,047
因为就目前而言船上是最安全的地方
The boat because right now that's the safest place to be.

390
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,049
因为我带回来的那帮人
Because when the boys that I brought over here come

391
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,052
走进这丛林  你们会希望离的远远滴
Stomping' out of this jungle, you're gonna wanna be long gone.

392
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:30,075
他们去哪里了?
Where'd they go?

393
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:34,097
他们朝温室去了  驻扎在那边  就等Linus落网
They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to snatch linus.

394
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:38,023
只要我们把你弄出来  你就能带我们离开这里吗
Soon as we cut you free, you'll be able fly us out of here?

395
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:40,016
-是的  -等等  混蛋
Hell, yeah. hang on, shaggy.

396
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,060
你说那帮人要抓Ben Linus?
You said the hit squad's gonna grab ben linus?

397
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,028
我想不到他们不抓他的理由
Well, I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.

398
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,044
他们要怎么处置和他一起的人?
What are they gonna do with the people that are with 'em?

399
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,036
反正不会善待
Nothin' good.

400
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,088
Hugo和Ben在一起
Hugo's with ben.

401
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:58,028
见鬼!
Son of a bitch.

402
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,098
大约在十个月前
About ten months ago,

403
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:05,045
我就写好了我父亲葬礼的悼言
I wrote what I wanted to say at my father's funeral

404
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:09,026
在悉尼机场时我把它写在了鸡尾酒餐巾上
On the back of a cocktail napkin at the sydney airport.

405
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,057
我记不清我写的什么了  但是那个内容
I don't remember what I wrote, but whatever it was...

406
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:16,015
我保证他不会喜欢
He would've hated it.

407
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:19,078
我父亲不喜欢被人赞颂
My father couldn't stand eulogies.

408
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:24,016
他曾说"清醒的唯一好处就是又可以大醉一场"
"the only good thing about a wake is the free booze," he'd say.

409
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,073
根本就没有守灵(双语)  因为我连葬送他的机会都没有
Not much of a wake because I won't even be able to bury him.

410
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,050
因此...
So...

411
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,057
我说的这些不是说给我父亲听的
What I wanna say is not for my father.

412
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,075
是说给我自己听的
It's for me.

413
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,022
一路好走  爸爸
Good-bye, dad.

414
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:51,056
我爱你
I loved you.

415
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:56,073
我想念你
I miss you.

416
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,092
非常感谢你的到来  谢谢  谢谢
Thanks very much for coming. thank you. thank you.

417
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,046
非常感谢你的到来  谢谢
Thank you for coming. thanks.

418
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:09,068
-一会回家见?  -好的
I'll see you back at the house? yeah.

419
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,038
-我爱你  亲爱的  -我爱你  妈妈
I love you, sweetheart. I love you, mom.

420
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:17,011
我很高兴你回来了
I'm so glad you're home.

421
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,036
-呆会儿见  -好的
I'll see you soon. okay.

422
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,039
你做得很好
You did that well.

423
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,087
练了很多次
Had a lot of practice.

424
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,005
打扰一下
Excuse me.

425
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,063
我能和你说几句话吗
May I have a word with you?

426
00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:44,080
Shephard先生...
Mr. shephard...

427
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:49,012
你失去了父亲  我感到很遗憾
I'm very sorry for your loss.

428
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:51,033
谢谢
Thank you.

429
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:54,067
你怎么会认识我父亲?
How did you know my father?

430
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,082
我想他来澳大利亚的原因是因为我
I believe I'm the reason he was in australia when he died.

431
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:04,089
抱歉  我不明白你的意思
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

432
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:06,073
他为什么要跑去看你?
Why would he have come to see you?

433
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:09,081
他...他不是来看我
Oh, he... he didn't come to see me.

434
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,029
那时我还在医院  我们没见到面
I was still in the hospital. I never saw him.

435
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,063
他是来看他的女儿

也是我的女儿  Shephard先生

-我父亲不曾有过女儿  -不  他有
My father didn't have a daughter-- yes. he did.

如果你不相信我  你可以去查一下电话记录

还有更奇怪的事  你想知道吗?

440
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:51,079
我的女儿也在你们的飞机上

她也在815航班上
She was on flight 8-1-5.

442
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:04,088
你们在飞机上呆了6个小时  你可能就在她的前几排
You were in the air for six hours, probably just a few rows from her.

443
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,049
而你却不知道她是你妹妹
And you never even knew she was your sister.

444
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:17,043
你们的飞机坠海时  她就死了
She was one of the ones who died when your plane hit the water.

445
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,073

我不想再给你增加负担  但是...

你有必要知道这件事

449
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:40,006
我...
I'm...

450

你失去亲人  我很抱歉
Sorry for your loss.

451
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,017
你儿子很漂亮
Your son is beautiful.

452
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,032
我不明白  你是怎样回到纽约的?
I don't understand. how'd you get back to new york?

453
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,049
我和Walt...

454
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:27,029
我们坐上Ben的船沿着轴向开回去的
We took ben's boat and we followed his bearing.

455
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,003
两天过后  我们到了一个有人居住的岛上
A couple of days, we came to an island, you know, with people.

456
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,076
然后我们搭乘一条货船回到美国
We hopped a cargo ferry back to the states.

457
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,086
不曾告诉别人我们的来历
Didn't tell anybody who we were.

458
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:40,017
现在你在为Ben卖命吗?
And now you're working for ben?

459
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,016
我没有为Ben卖命
I do not work for ben.

460
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,087
我努力弥补我的过失
I'm trying to make up for what I did.

461
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:50,098
我想帮你们离开那里
I'm trying to help you out here.

什么情况?
What's the matter?

467
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,057
这不是Jack或Sawyer的脚印
These aren't jack or sawyer.

468
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,066
是其他人的  刚留下的...
They're different tracks, fresh...

469
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,074
他们绕到我们后面去了
And they're doubling back behind us.

470
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,054
不管你是谁  快给我滚出来!
Whoever you are, come out now!

00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:31,020
-请你们放下枪  -你再走一步...  -我说过放下枪
Please just drop your guns. take one more step-- I said drop your guns.

476
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,082
我看见其中两个  但没有杀死Alex的那个人
I see two of them, but not the one who killed alex.

477
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,096
他在那
He's there.

478
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,082
帮我拿着这个  好吗
Hold on to that for me, will you?

479
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:53,082
什么?
What?

480
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:55,050
仔细听我说  John
Listen to me very carefully, john,

481
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,055
因为我没时间重复
Because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this.

482
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,066
你得穿过那个洞进去温室
You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there.

483
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,021
一旦进去  左转
Once inside, you're gonna turn left.

484
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:07,076
大约走20步  直到在左手边看到一片花烛为止
Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left.

485
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:10,042
他们在壁凹里背对北墙
They're in an alcove against the north wall.

486
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,041
面对墙壁  用左手伸进去
Face that wall, reach down with your left hand.

487
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,091
你会摸到开升降机的开关
You'll find a switch that activates the elevator.

488

升降机会带你们到兰花站台

489
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,007
等等 什么?

我要怎样对付里面那些武装人员

你他妈要怎样去应付他们

我跟你说过多少次了  John?

我自有办法
