我没办法把他包装一下 所以...

41

我在废墟里面找到这些
I found these in the wreckage,

42
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:13,083
而且这对我来说也没用
and I have no use for them personally.

00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,060
它们刚好合我的尺寸
They're actually my size.

44
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:19,003
嗯  大了半码  不过我敢肯定
Well, half a size off, but I swear,

45
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,080
这个鬼地方已经让我的脚肿了半码
this place is making my feet swell.

46
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:25,003
又发现了这个岛的一种神秘力量
Another mysterious force on the island revealed.

47
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,020
嘿  Boone  问你点事  兄弟
Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude.

48
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,013
你和Locke每天都出去打野猪是吧
You and Locke are hunting boar every day, right?

49
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,090
怎么了
What about it?

50
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,046
那很好  但是  呃...
It's cool, except

51
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,040
为什么你们什么都没带回来
how come you're not coming back with any?

52
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,053
我们的盘子里一个星期都没有新鲜野猪肉了  哥们
We haven't had fresh pork on our plate in about a week.

53
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,046
它们可不是圈养起来等着你去吃的
It's not like they're domesticated animals.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,063
也许你们还不够努力吧
Maybe you aren't trying hard enough?

55
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,060
我们已经去打猎了  听见没
We're hunting.

56
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:51,016
但愿如此  大伙都需要食物
I hope so, 'cause people need food, man.

固体食物
Solid food.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,063
这可不是个游戏  哥们
This isn't a game, man.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,003
真不敢相信上一个球你居然接住了
I can't believe you ran down that last ball.

60
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,063
然后打回来赢了
Then you hit it for a winner.

61
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,040
运气好罢了
Lucky shot.

62
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,023
是吗  希望是运气
Yeah, I wish it was luck.

63
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,050
是我的电话吗?
Is that my phone?

64
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,010

70
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,026
滚开 离我远点
Get out of here! Get the hell away from me!

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,080
Shannon?

72
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,090
在那别动  不要靠近我
Stay out of here! Get the hell away from me!

73
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,060
-Shannon 出什么事了  -现在不能说
-Shannon What's going on?  -I can't talk.

74
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,020

离我妹妹远点
Stay away from my sister.

79
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:53,083
刚才你的语气好象在给我下命令
For a moment, you seemed to be giving me an order.

80
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,073
只是一个友好的建议
It's just a friendly suggestion.

一个建议

82
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,053
是的  要是我是你的话  我一定会听
Yes, and if I were you, I'd listen.

83
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,023
如果我不听呢?
What if I don't?

84
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:05,030

你应该把你和Sayid的分歧暂时放到一边

特别是看到我们什么也没带回去

-你是说没有野猪  -是的

我所要告诉你的  呃...
Anything I tell you is, uh,

106
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:28,057
是医生和病人之间的秘密  行吗
doctor-patient confidential, right?

107
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,090
好的

108

00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,027

我的胃

113
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:44,030
有点消化不良
I've been having some, um...major digestive issues.

椰子  还有山上采回来的一些无名水果

有人告诉我说那是帮助消化的
Someone said they'd be good for digestion.

120
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,033
我告诉你吧  他们在撒谎
Let me tell you, they lied.

121
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,047
如果有点蛋白质
It might help if you had a little more protein

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,047
在你的食物里的话  可能会有用
in your diet

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,013
哥们  我该怎么办
Dude  What can I do?

124

我们没有野猪 没有猪肉就没有蛋白质

-那哥们  我欠他  -别开玩笑...
-That guy has it in for me.  -Come on...

127
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,060
我可不是开玩笑的 他给了我很多吃的东西  比如
I'm not kidding. He offered me some to eat, like,

128
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:15,080
在我们到这里之后
right after we, you know, got here.

129
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,003
嗯  那些带刺的
Um, that thing with the spikes.

海胆
Sea urchin.

131
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,090
是的  当我拒绝他之后
Yeah, when I turned him down,

132
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:24,057
就好象我败坏了他的家族荣誉似的
it's like I soiled his family honor or something.

133
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,083
从那以后他就再没正眼看过我
He hasn't looked me in the eye since.

134
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,013
他现在还在赌气呢
The guy holds a serious grudge.

135
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,003
你没打算吃那些东西吧
You're not eating those, are you?

136
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,000
哥们  这些不是用来吃的(用来上厕所)
Dude, these aren't for eating.

137
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:38,050
抱歉我去一下
Excuse me.

138
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:14,090
我能看到你在那
I can see you there, you know.

139
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,077
我并没有在藏着
I wasn't hiding.

140
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,063
我只是不想打断...
I just didn't want to disrupt you from doing...

141
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:24,023
你正在做的事情
...whatever it is you're doing.

142
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,057
这又不是什么秘密的事
It's not like it's a secret.

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,067
是你的话有时候很难说
Hard to tell with you sometimes.

144
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,037
啊! 恶心的小小的灰黄色的东西
Ah! Gross, little, grayish yellow things.

145

西番莲果的种子

146
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,047
用来干什么的
What are they for?

147
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,077
想知道的话  我来告诉你
I'll show you...if you want to see.

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,013
好啊
Yeah.

149
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:49,070
跟我来
Follow me.

150
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,017
告诉我你发现了一个咖啡吧
Please tell me you found a coffee bar.

不是我
I didn't.

154

都是Sun弄的
It was all Sun.

155
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,023
我只是有一天无意中走到这里
I wandered into this place the other day

156
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,027
当时我正在采集水果
when I was picking fruit.

157
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,090
这真漂亮  太棒了
This is beautiful. It's great.

158
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:24,023
她种了这些草和一些比较矮的植物
She planted some herbs and some low-growing stuff here,

159
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:27,027
然后在那边建了个果树园
and then she started a grove over there.

160
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,077
聪明
Smart.

161
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,077
现在野猪没有了  我们需要
With the boar running out, we're gonna need

162
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,087
食物越多越好
as much food as we can possiblely get.

163
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,087
也许野猪并不是没有了
Maybe it's not running out.

164
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,070
你什么意思
What do you mean?

165
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,067
也许Locke并没打算继续去给我们打野猪
Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore.

166
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,043
为什么
Why would he do that?

167
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,043
岛上有这么多人要吃饭
A lot of mouths to feed.

168
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,083
如果野猪已经快没有了  他为什么要打来
If the boar's thinning out, why should he feed everyone else

169
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:51,000
给其他人吃  这样他自己不就吃不到了
at his own expense?

170
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,000
我们打不破玻璃
That glass isn't breaking,

171
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:55,000
门也被封死了
and the door is sealed shut.

172
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:57,083
我想它是水泥做的
I think it's cement.

173
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,083
那是什么?
What is that?

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,070
碗里的东西是什么
The stuff in the bowl, what is that?

175
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,080
一会有用的
It's for later.

176
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:08,090
也不是太难  但是...
Not to be too difficult, but...

177
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,013
我们到这有两天了
we've been coming here for two days,

178
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,063
只能盯着这东西看
just staring at this thing.

179
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,097
我不知道我们应该干什么
I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.

180
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,083
Michelangelo的父亲...
Michelangelo's father

181
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:24,000
是一个很有钱的人
he was a wealthy man.

182
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:26,050
他不理解他儿子
Had no understanding of the divinity in his son,

183
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,050
所以他就打他儿子
so he beat him.

184
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,000
他的儿子中
No child of his

185
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,037
没有一个会用自己的双手来谋生
was gonna use his hands for a living.

186
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,037
所以Michelangelo也学会了不凭自己的能力做事
So Michelangelo learned not to use his hands.

187
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,053
几年后  一个来访问的王子
Years later, a visiting prince

188
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:39,070
来到了Michelangelo的工作室
came into Michelangelo's studio

189
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,053
然后发现他
and found the master

190
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:44,037
盯着一个18英尺长的大理石块
staring at a single 18-foot block of marble.

191
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,043
然后他就知道那些谣言是真的了
Then he knew the rumors were true that

192
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,077
Michelangelo每天走到这里
Michelangelo had come in every day

193
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,077
在过去的四个月里
for the past four months,

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,077
盯着大理石看
stared at the marble

195
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,077
然后就回家吃晚饭
and gone home for his supper.

196
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,033
所以王子就问  一个显然的问题
So the prince asked the obvious:

197
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,050
"你在干什么"
"What are you doing?"

198
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,010
然后Michelangelo就转过身来看他
And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him

199
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:03,050
轻声说  
and whispered...

200
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,057
"我在工作"
"I'm working"

201
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,093
三年后  那块大理石
Three years later, that block of marble

202
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:14,067
就变成了David的雕象
was the statue of David

203
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:19,037
我们不是来这盯着它看四个月的
We're not gonna stare at this thing for four months

204
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,003
是不是?
are we?

205
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,080
我们怎么才能把它弄开
How we gonna open it?

206
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,060
嗯  那就是我们得解决的问题
That's what we have to figure out

207
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,097
就是我们得待在这里的原因
That's why we're sitting here

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,043
我是说  你怎么打开一个...
I mean, how do you open a...

209
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,013
没有把手或者门闩的舱门...
hatch that has no handle, no latch...

210
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,070
看不出能用什么方法来打开吗?
no discernible way of opening it?

211
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,083
谁啊
Yeah?

212
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,010
-我来找Shannon  -你是谁
-I'm looking for Shannon.  -Who are you?

213
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:55,053
她哥哥
I'm her brother.

214
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:04,030
Boone?

215
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,080
出什么事了?
What's going on?

216
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,033
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

217
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:10,080
15个小时  我刚刚在飞机上度过了15个小时
Fifteen hours. I just spent 15 hours on a plane.

218
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,023
"很高兴看到你"
"I'm happy to see you. Glad you're here."

219
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,097
说点那些话也许比较好
Something like that might work.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
听着  你来的也许不是时候
Listen, this isn't really the best time.

221
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,080
Bryan和我正打算
Bryan and I were on our way out

222
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,067
去见几个朋友
to meet some friends.

223
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,010
你干吗不明天再给我打一个电话
Give me a call tomorrow.

224
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,027
求你了
Please.

225
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,090
好吧
Okay.

226
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,063
祝你玩得开心
Enjoy your friends.

227
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,040
Jin!

228
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,027
嘿  Jin
Yo, Jin!

229
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,093
Alto!

230
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,097
听我说哥们 我知道你不喜欢我
Listen I know you don't like me

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,097
因为海胆那件事情
'cause of the sea urchin thing.

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,047
没关系  我不是来找你帮忙的
That's okay, 'cause I'm not asking for any favors.

233
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,097
只要  告诉我你在哪里抓的鱼
Just let me know where you get the fish.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,030
鱼
Fish.

235
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,097
只要告诉我大概的方向就可以了
Just point me the right direction.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,003
我会用自己的工具去抓的
I'll take care of my own business with my own tools.

237
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:16,007
(我会用我自己的方式来管好我自己的事情)

238
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,027
你刚才说了些不好听的  是不是
You just said something mean, didn't you?

239
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:26,043
你知道  我们得告诉他们
You know, we're gonna have to tell 'em.

240
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:27,093
告诉他们什么?
Tell them what?

241
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:29,050
我们发现的东西
What we found.

242
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,067
你也知道  他们不会一直都相信
You know they're not gonna keep believing that

243
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,030
我们是去打猎
we're coming out here hunting.

244
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,067
还没到告诉他们的时候 他们不会明白的
They're not ready. They won't understand it.

245
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,000
-我不认为我明白  -那就是问题所在
-I don't think I understand it.  -That's the problem.

246
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,017
听我说  至少  我要告诉Shannon
Look, at least... I gotta tell Shannon.

247
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,003
这还用问吗  因为她是我妹妹
What do you mean why? 'Cause she's my sister.

248
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:47,087
为什么你这么关心她
Why do you care about her so much?

249
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,077
哥们你不明白的
You don't know her, man.

250
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,090
她非常聪明  而且在很多方面很特别
She's smart and she's special in a lot of ways.

251
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:55,020
省省吧
Fair enough.

252
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,043
她一直都在问我这个
She's been asking me about this.

253
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,057
我不能一直都对她撒谎
I can't keep lying to her.

254
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,023
你的意思是说你不能一直对她撒谎
You mean you can't keep lying to her,

255
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:06,007
还是你受不了她一直这样怀疑你
or you can't stand the way she makes you feel

256
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,057
因为你在撒谎
because you're lying to her?

257
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,090
都有  随便了
Both. Whatever.

258
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:13,070
听我说  她能保密的
Look, she can keep a secret.

259
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:16,070
你确定吗
You're sure?

260
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,030
是的  我确定
Yes, I'm sure.

261
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,093
不是  我是说你确定你要告诉她吗?
No. I mean, are you sure you want to do this?

262
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,093
我得摆脱这种处境
I gotta get her off my back.

263
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:24,093
她老是来问我这个
She keeps asking me about this,

264
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,060
老是来问我关于你 还有整个这件事
she keeps asking about you, about the whole thing.

265
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,057
你肯定你已经自己考虑过了吗?
Are you sure you've thought through the ramifications?

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,053
是的
Yes.

267
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,027
那么去吧
So be it.

268
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:02,024
Locke...

269
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,094
这是什么
What is this?

270
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,024
听见我说的话了吗?
you hear me?

271
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,060
把我解开
Untie me right now.

272
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:14,007
为什么
Or what?

273
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,007
我发誓我不会对任何人讲关于这个舱门的事  可以了吧
I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay?

274
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,057
我发誓
I promise.

275
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,057
我这样做  Boone  因为是时候让你
I'm doing this Boone, because it's time for you

276
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,057
让你放下一些事了
to let go of some things

277
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,057
因为这样对你是最好的
because it's what's best for you.

278
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,077
而且我保证
And I promise

279
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,057
以后你会因为这个感谢我的
you're gonna thank me for this later.

280
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,004
喂  我可不觉得这样对我来说最好的
Hey, I don't think this is best for me.

281
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,017
那是什么
What is that?

282
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,097
一个没处理的伤口...
An untreated wound out here...

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,017
会被感染的
it's gonna get infected.

284
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,000
你不能把我留在这儿
You're not gonna leave me here.

285
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,064
留不留在这取决于你
Whether you stay is up to you.

286
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:48,010
营地在西面四公里的地方
The camp is four miles due west.

287
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,027
西边是哪边
Which way is west?

288
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,094
你会自己解开的
You'll be able to cut yourself free

289
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:04,067
当你有适当的动力的时候
once you have the proper motivation.

290
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,090
Locke!

291
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,004
救命
Help!

292
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,050
很抱歉  Carlisle先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle,

293
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:43,000
恐怕我帮不了你
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

294
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:45,027
遗憾的是  先生 我们还得需要点东西才能继续
Unfortunately sir. We'll need a little more to go on.

295
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,064
我不明白  我在举报一起犯罪
I don't understand this. I'm reporting a crime.

296
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,014
听着  有一个精神病和她在一起 明白吗?
Look, this is a pyscho with her, okay?

297
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,014
我妹妹不巧被一个
My sister happens to be attracted

298
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,077
错误的家伙给迷住了
to the wrong kind of guy.

299
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,044
这是他的瓶子  我只是把它还给他
It was his bottle. I just gave it back to him.

300
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,060
喂  嘿  鳄鱼猎人
Hey, yo, croc hunter!

301
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:02,070
为什么都没人想听我讲啊
How come nobody wants to hear my side of the story?

302
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,070
如果那是她的朋友的话
Now, if that were her mate,

303
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,064
那我还可能帮你  知道吗
see, then I could help you.

304
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,017
你把要说的说完吧
Let's finish taking down rest of your information.

305
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,077
你刚才说她是你的妹妹
You were saying she's your sister.

306
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,064
那为什么她的名字是Rutherford 但你的却是Carlisle
Then why is her name Rutherford and yours Carlisle?

307
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,057
她结婚了没
Is she married?

308

310
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,037
Rutherford是她父亲的名字

我们不能毫无理由的冲到别人家里面
We can't just go barging into people's apartments.

326
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:01,064
遗憾的是  我们虽然是警察  却不是管约会的警察

找个她不在的时候去她家
Go to her house when she's not there

那么你大老远跑过来就是为了贿赂我啦

350
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:11,090
"小心对待你所希望的事物"
"Be careful with what you wish for"

351

太阳在那个方向落下
The sun's gonna set there,

430
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,034
所以那是西方
so that makes that west.

431
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,000
那么哪个就是北方
That'd be north.

432
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,054
好
Yeah.

433
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,060
正确  北方应该在那

440
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,057
我在说这个指南针有明显的错误

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,030
嘿  兄弟  你还不明白是吧
Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you?

464
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:51,060
这是怎么回事
What's what.

465
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,044
你算计我
You set me up.

整个事情都是算计好的
This whole thing was a setup.

467
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:06,024
她只是得到她应该得到的东西
She's getting what she's owed.

468
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:07,014
你再说一遍
What did you say?

469
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,094
她告诉我你母亲勒索Shannon
She told me your mum screwed Shannon over

470
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:11,037
在她父亲死后
after her daddy died

471
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,014
把她父亲的钱全部据为己有
kept her father's money for herself.

472
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:15,094
哦  真是好妈妈  你说对了
Oh, sweet mum you got there.

473
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:19,034
这不是第一次 对吧
This isn't the first time, is it?

474
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,087
你以前也干过
You've done this before

475
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,077
你这个婊子
little bitch.

476

-好了  够了没有  -别碰我  你这个卑鄙的...

478
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,037
放开他  放开
Get off of him! Get off!

479
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:04,037
有船吗?
Any ships?

480
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,084
还没有
Not yet.

481
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:08,037
可是我...有的是耐心
But I'm... patient.

482
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,090
不介意我也加入你们吧
Mind if I join you?

483
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,074
我们好久都没说过话了  John
Been a while since you and I talked, John.

484
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:19,094
嗯  你可是个大忙人
Well, you're a busy man.

485
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,047
你也一样
So are you.

486
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,074
Boone在哪
Where's Boone?

487
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:30,000
今天我还没看见过他
I haven't seen him today.

488
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,060
是吗?
Yeah?

489
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:34,050
你们俩整个星期都像被拴在一起一样
You two have been attached at the hip all week.

490
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:37,017
好  我来检查一下
Well, let me just check my hip.

491
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,010
不  Boone不在这
Nope, no Boone.

492
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,094
打猎打的如何了
How's the boar hunting going?

493
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:45,050
你我之间吗
Between you and me?

494
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:47,004
总是这样
Always.

495
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:49,090
恐怕它们都搬到我们的山谷外住了
I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley.

496
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,034
他们真是聪明的动物
They're smart animals

497
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:54,044
聪明的动物很会适应环境
and smart animals adapt quickly

498
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:57,057
特别是当一种新的捕食者闯入了他们的环境中时
when a new predator's introduced into their environment.

499
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,010
你是说我们?

只有Micheal晓得
Only Michael.

503

不是你丈夫么
Not your husband?

504

别担心  我会保密的
Don't worry. I can keep a secret.

506
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:22,074
我在韩国曾学过英语的
I took English lessons in Korea.

507
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:26,017
他不知道  这是...
He doesn't know. It's...

508
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,057
很复杂的一件事
complicated.

509
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,074
-那你为什么不现在告诉他呢  -我不能
-So why don't you tell him now?  -I can't.

510
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:32,054
为什么

511
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:35,064
因为我爱他
Because I love him.

512
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,097
我不 ...
I don't...

513
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,010
你曾对你爱的人撒过谎么
Have you never lied to a man you've loved?

514
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:50,044
你肯定你真的不会英语吗
You sure you don't speak English?

515
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:52,057
因为有谣言说你们会说
'Cause there's a rumor that you do.

516
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:57,000
你妻子很惹眼哪
Your wife's hot.

517
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:12,050
哦  我知道了  这算是某种回报吧
Oh, I get it. This is some kind of payback

518
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:16,017
因为上次我不愿意吃海胆吗
because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time?

519
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,020
我吃这个  你给了我一条鱼  是吧
I eat this, you give me a fish, right?

520
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:22,040
好吧
Okay, fine.

521
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,064
嘴一闭就咽下去了
Over the lips, past the gums,

522
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,020
YADA,YADA...

523
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:30,070
噢  老天
Oh, God.

524
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:56,027
干杯
Cheers.

525
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:01,020
要帮忙吗?
You need a hand?

526
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:02,067
是啊
Yeah.

527
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,024

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,004
你问我我过的怎样么?
How am I doing?

532
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,037
是指当我对付两周的戒毒时
With week two of heroin withdrawal,

533
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,000
还是我处理claire被那个
or with Claire being abducted by

534
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:24,007
想杀死我的疯子绑架的事情
the freak who tried to kill me?

535
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,037
我给你阿斯匹林来抵抗海洛因吧  Charilie
I gave you the aspirin for the withdrawal. Charilie

536
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:33,014

都杀了
all his mates in the post office

如果他妈妈忘了在他饭盒里面放午餐甜饼

如果你不想跟我走  就别跟着

我才不会跟着你
I wouldn't have to

578
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,020
如果你和那个带我们到这里的疯子不是朋友的话

579
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,030

你知道"这个家伙"是谁吗

他是唯一一个知道这里发生什么了的人

然后他就对我干了这些事
That's when he did this.

602
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,005
快跑

Shanoon!

606

那真有诗意  你觉得呢

我知道你一定会带钱的 我知道你会的

-你喝醉了  -你知道为什么吗
-You are drunk.  -Do you wanna know why?

613
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,085
那不重要    因为你会告诉我的

你一直都爱着我

你一直都是一个以自我为中心的小婊子

620
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:43,038
但现在你想错了

Boone

628
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,051
我们回洛杉矶之后
When we get back to LA,

629
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:50,012
你应该告诉你母亲...

你又救了我就象你从前那样

该去的地方
To what it was.

00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:04,022
好像一切都是由你来决定
Like it's all up to you.

00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,028
穿好衣服
Get dressed.

635

都是你的错   你把她带到那去的

-你妹妹  -不要跟我装聋作哑

冷静一下

她在我怀里死去的
She died in my arms.

648
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:58,031
为什么你身上没有血迹
Why is there no blood on you?

649
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:06,061
见鬼  我刚刚在那发生了什么事
What the hell! What just happened to me out there?

我不知道
I don't know.

我给你了一个我认为对于你能够在岛上
I gave you an experience that I believed was
