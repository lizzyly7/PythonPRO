在你变成土著人之前 你是干什么的?
What did you do for a living before you became Moses?

她没关系吧?
Is she okay?

57
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,079
为什么这样说?
Why wouldn't she be?

58
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,011
因为大家都不信任她
Because none of your people trusts her.

59
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,066
我不是针对你
No offense.

60
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,075
那我先走了 你们慢慢跟上

没错
That's it.

71
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:13,005
一旦摇滚巨星把水下的 那个阻挠系统关闭...
Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption is jamming us up,

72
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:16,050

这随时都会发生 是吗?
That'll be any time now, yeah?

74
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:22,032
希望如此
Hopefully.

75
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,087

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,033
如果你告诉我们你是 怎么下来的  我们就不会伤害你

78

有个闪着黄灯的开关

他们中的一个人在这里
One of them's down here.

他说Juliet告诉他的

You need to go down to the Looking Glass

3个帐篷都做上了 白色的标记

再见 Jack
Goodbye,Jack.

156
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:17,025
为什么只有两次爆炸?
Why were there only two explosions?

157
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,012
也许他们不需要引爆 第三个帐篷
Maybe they didn't have to blow the 3rd tent.

158
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,052
-但那里枪声是怎么回事?  -他不会有事的 Rose
But those gunshots...What was that about?  -He's okay.

159
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,078
你这么认为吗?
Do you believe that?

160
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:26,042
他们根本毫无防备
Listen,they had no idea that we were waiting for them,

161
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,091
而且Sayid也和他们在一起 他们会没事的  几小时后就能赶上我们
and Sayid's with your husbands.They're gonna
 be fine,and they're gonna be a couple hours behind us.

162
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,095
-那我们等在这里  你先走...  -不行!
-We should wait for them here.You go...  -No.

163
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,005
谁也不能留在这里
No one gets left behind.

164
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:40,057
如果你对我说"同生独死"的话 Jack  我会给你一巴掌
If you say,"live together, die alone" to me,I'm gonna punch you in your face.

165
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,002
这很公平 Rose
Fair enough, Rose.

166
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,053
这很公平
Fair enough.

167
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,098
但我们有计划
But we have a plan!

168
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:50,021
我们现在知道  我们成功了
And for all we know, it worked.

00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:54,065
没事的  会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.Everything is gonna be all right.

170
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,016
我们继续前进好吗?
Let's just keep moving, okay?

171
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:12,055
没关系的  我们走...
It's okay. Let's go.

172
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,033
我再问你一遍
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.

173
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,083
你为什么来这里?
Why are you here?

174
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,084
我来这里...
I'm here...

175
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:33,092
是来关掉你们的阻挠系统 就在那个黄灯的旁边

- You are, huh?   - Most definitely am.

179
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,067
那密码是什么?
So what's the code?

180
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,083
什么?
What?

181
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,092
如果你想要关掉它 你还需要一个密码
If you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment,you're gonna need the code,

182
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:56,042
只有3个人知道  我  她  还有Ben
and only three people know it. Me,her and Ben.

183
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,009

00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:08,078
我不需要什么密码 当这个站被淹掉后...
Guess I won't need the code...Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway.

185
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,061
只要关掉那个开关 直升机就会来救我的朋友了
Now just turn off your little jammer,and the
helicopters come and rescue all my friends.

186

说起正确的时间地点

304
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,070
这个女人很幸运有你在场
This woman is very lucky you were there.

305
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,070
如果她够幸运 她的背就不会骨折了
If she was lucky,she wouldn't have a fractured back

306
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,020
她的脊椎受到了严重的外伤

307
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,079
我想一早就给她做手术

很抱歉  但她不是你的病人

313
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,099
Hamill医生  但我还是 想自己来做
Dr.Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

314
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,030
昨晚

00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,060
回家吧
Go home.

322
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,080
去喝一杯
Have a drink.

323
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,059
这是你应得的
You deserve it.

324
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,089
情况表 Jack

327

今晨  第6大街的这座桥 被关闭了几小时

328
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,090

333
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,000
然后对他们进行了急救 直到救护车的到来

我不会碍事的 你在这里也不需要我
I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it,but you sure as hell don't need me.

344
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,060
你认为你孤身一人 又不带武器过去 能够搞定?
What do you think you're gonna get done,alone and unarmed?

345
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,040
-我和他一起去  -不行
-He won't be alone.I'll go with him.  -No.

20分钟前你还不想回去
20 mins ago,you weren't even interested in going,

347
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,060
-现在你突然告诉Jack...  -我不想和你一起去
-and now all of a sudden,you're telling Jack...  -I didn't wanna go with you.

348
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,070
没枪的话就只是去送死
It's a suicide mission without guns.

349
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,030
我知道哪里有枪
I know where there are some guns.

350
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,050
离这里几英里的地方 有个隐藏地点
There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here.

351
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,090
我们去海滩的路上 能顺便去下那里
I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.

352
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,070
Juliet 你不必这么做的
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

353
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,060
是的 Jack  我要这么做

如果你不做的话
I won't if you won't.

357
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,040
别等我们
Don't wait up.

358
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:55,000
我叫你闭嘴!
I told you to shut up!

359
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
你知道一个曲子 一直萦绕在脑海里
You know how you get a tune stuck in your head?

360
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,060
这首歌就会让你 有灵感了
This song...It just started coming to me.

361
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,000
如果找到桥的话 就完成了
It's almost finished.Just need to find the bridge.

362

-拿叉枪来  -什么? 为什么?

363

因为我想搞点伤害
'Cause I want it to hurt.

364
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,060
-不  Ben说我们...  -你不去  我去
-No, Ben said we...  -You don't wanna get it? I will.

365
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,050
Bonnie

366
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,070
好好好  我闭嘴!
No. I'll... I'll shut up!

367
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,080
我闭嘴!  一定闭嘴!
I'll shut up,I'll shut up

368
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,040
Mikhail?

369
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,000
我还以为你们在加拿大
I thought you two were on assignment in Canada.

370
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
他让我们承诺不告诉任何人
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

371
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,010
-你好啊   -另一个人在哪里?
-Hello again.  -Where is the other one?

372
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,040
-什么?  -那个白痴跳下了船
-What?  -This idiot swam down from a boat.

373
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,000
我刚向他的朋友开了枪
I was just shooting at his friend.

374
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,090
他潜水下来了 只有他一个人
He dove down here. He's alone.

375
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,080
你确定吗?
Are you sure about that?

376
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,040
我有个更好的问题  电磁人
Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops.

377
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,010
为什么你们的小朋友Ben 告诉你们这个站被淹了?
Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't?

378
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,090
还有为什么这两个人 一直在阻挠这里的信号?
Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the island?

379
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,030
什么?
What?

380
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,090
是真的吗?
Is that true?

381
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,030
-那是Ben  -我来和他说
-That's Ben.  -I'll get it.

382
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,070
你要明白  我做的一切 都是为了这座岛
You have to understand.Everything I did,I did for the island.

383
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,010
这座岛告诉你你能 欺骗自己的人吗?
The island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?

384
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,070
我也没办法
Yes, it did.

385
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,020
你一直都很忠诚 Mikhail 现在你要相信我
You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail.Now I'm asking you to trust me,

386
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,000
相信Jacob  是他 告诉我这样做的
to trust Jacob who told me to do that.

387
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,050
Jacob让你对自己人撒谎?
Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?

388
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:35,030
因为这座岛一直受到强大力量 的袭击  未来我们也必须这样做
cos this island's under assault by
 forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many,many years,

389
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,060
所以我们要保护它  不惜一切代价
and we are meant to protect it,by any means necessary.

390
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,010
阻挠信号是为了大家的安全
The jamming was for everyone's security.

391
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,060
我们的处境很危险
We are in a serious situation here.

392
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,060
为什么不信任我?
So why not trust me?

393
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,080
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

394
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,060
我应该告诉你的 我向你道歉
I should have told you, and I apologize.

395
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,020
Mikhail 你还在吗?
Mikhail, are you still there?

396
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,000
是的
Yes.

397
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,070
我需要你的帮助
I need you to help me.

398
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,060
我要你弥补我的过失
I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made.

399
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,010
我要你杀了Charlie
I need you to kill Charlie.

400
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,050
确保干扰设备继续正常运转
Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all cost.

401
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,070
我们不能冒险让Greta和Bonnie 告诉其他人这件事
And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others what we've done,

402
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,040
所以把他们也一起解决了
so you'll have to take care of them, too.

403
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
我怎么才能相信你对 他们说的也是这一套?
How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me?

404
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,010
因为我说了的话 Mikhail 你早就没命了
Because if I had, Mikhail...you'd already be dead.

405
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,035
你还好吗?
You okay?

406
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,002
没事  只是...
Yeah, I just...

407
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,056
鞋里有块石头
got a rock in my shoe.

408
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:27,013
他不是那个意思
He didt mean it, you know.

409
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:31,048
-什么?  -Sawyer
-What?  -Sawyer.

410
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:34,079
他说他不想跟你一起回去 他不是那个意思
When he said that he didn't want you to go with him... he didn't mean it.

411
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,077
如果他不是那个意思 他干嘛那么说?
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

412
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,001
他只是想保护你
He was trying to protect you.

413
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,090
这也就是我叫你 别回来找我的原因
That's why I asked you not to come back for me.

414
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:56,047
你干嘛要替Sawyer说话?
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

415
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,022
他绝不会替你说话
He'd never do it for you.

416
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:06,075
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

417
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:33,040
把我们赶出关熊的笼子 然后把我们锁在一起
Out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang,

418
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,080
还有为什么让我们 打碎那些石头呢?
what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for, anyway?

419
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,020
我们在建跑道
We were building a runway.

420
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,070
跑道?  干嘛用的?
A runway? For what?

421
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,000
那些外星人
The aliens.

422
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,080
我也不知道 你以为他们什么都告诉我吗?
I don't know what for.Do you think they told me everything?

423
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,060
随便你说吧
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

424
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,060
-你和Jack上过床了吗?  -没有
-So you screwing Jack yet?  -No.

425
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,080
你呢?
Are you?

426
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,090
离那些枪还有多远?
How far away are these guns?

427
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,040
根本没什么枪
There aren't any guns.

428
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,030
什么?
What?

429
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,030
-我撒了谎  -你撒谎
-I lied.  -You lied.

430
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,040
这是他能让我们 回来的唯一借口
It was the only way he'd let us go back.

431
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,060
你为什么要回来
So why are you going back?

432
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,080
因果报应吧
Karma.

433
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,020
你又什么要回来呢 James?
Why are you going back, James?

434
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,000
伙计们  等一下!
Hey, guys! Wait up!

435
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,070

What the hell do you want?

436
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,030
我想和你们一起去
I'm coming with you guys.

437
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,050

拜托  我能帮上忙的
Come on. I can help.

439

他们也是我的朋友
They're my friends, too, man.

440
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Charlie不肯让我和他们去
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him,

441
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,090
Jack在那边忙得没空和我说话
and Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me.

442
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,040
我只是想帮下忙  好吗?

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,030
走吧
Come on.

446
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,040
如果我们朝北走 我们可以在他们之前到塔那里
If we head north,we should get to them before they reach the tower.

447
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,070
为什么让我一起来?
Why did you let me come?

448
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,010
我让你来是想把你 交托给一个新的家庭

449
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,040
我让你来是因为你背叛了我

450
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,010
你把Karl关在笼子里

还把他关在那个房间里 给他洗脑

我不想让你怀孕

453
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,050
我想我反应过度了

454
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,050
我们最好现在就上路 
We'd better get going.

455
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,080
你为什么要阻止他们?
Why do you have to stop them?

456
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,000
就不能让他们走吗?
Why won't you just let them leave?

457
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,000
因为我不能 Alex
Because I can't, Alex.

458
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,060
别这样 John
Don't, John.

459
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,050
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

460
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,040
-Walt?  -起来John
-Walt?  -Now get up, John.

461
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,050
他朝我开枪 我的腿动不了了
He shot me, and I can't...move my legs.

462
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,010
你能的
You can move your legs.

463
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,030
快从坑里爬起来
Now get out of the ditch.

为什么?
Why?

465
