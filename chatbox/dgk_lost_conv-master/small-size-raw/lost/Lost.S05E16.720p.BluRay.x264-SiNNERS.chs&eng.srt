他们怎么找到这岛的
How did they find the island?

10
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:00,034
等他们到了岛上你再问他们吧
You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.

11
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:03,097
我不需要问
I don't have to ask.

12
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,041
是你带他们来的
You brought them here.

13

00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:19,037
他们来到这里  争斗
They come. They fight.

16

破坏  腐败
They destroy. they corrupt.

然后是一如既往的结局
It always ends the same.

00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,082
只会有一次结局
It only ends once.

19
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,088
在那之前的所有事都只是个铺垫
Anything that happens before that is just progress.

20
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:42,065
你明不明白我多么渴望杀了你吗
Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?

21
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,088
是的
Yes.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,068
迟早的事  总有哪一天
One of these days, sooner or later...

00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:51,066
我会找到一个枪眼的  我的朋友

两包烟吗
Two cigarettes?

43
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,079
他会喜欢这些的
There's nothing he would like less.

44

你们两个小鬼拿了什么
What you kids got there?

45
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:41,017
打开你的背包
Open your bag.

46
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,068
你哪来的这个
Mm-hmm. Where'd you get this?

因为我这里不容许偷窃  你明白吗
Because I don't tolerate stealing here. You understand?

00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,022
没必要那么做
No need to do that.

52
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,072
我来买单
I'll pay for it.

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,096
我想这些足够了
I hope this is enough.

54
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,070
只要有人付钱
Well, long as somebody pays for it,

55
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,023
那就没什么大不了的
Guess there's no harm done.

56
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:18,094
但我不希望再次见到你们没有父母带时
But I don't wanna see you in here ever again

57
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,085
在这里晃悠  懂吗
Without your parents. You understand me?

谢谢你  先生
Thanks, mister.

不客气
You're welcome.

60
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,064
不会再继续偷了  对吧
You're not gonna steal anymore, are you?

61
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,047
乖乖的  Katie
Be good, Katie.

62
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,038
欢迎大家上船
Welcome aboard, everyone.

63
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,064
我们要做一些海上的系统检查
We will be doing some system checks offshore here

64
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,053
然后驶向开阔海域前
Before heading out into the open ocean

65
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:53,011
再下潜到可控的运行深度
And submerging to our operational running depth.

66
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,039
你们会收到你们的镇静剂
You should be receiving your sedatives,

67
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,063
然后你们会被带到你们的休息仓
And then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.

68
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,087
好好休息  我们到站后再见
Have a nice rest. See you on the other side.

69
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,047
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here.

70
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,053
离开这里
"out of here"?

71
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,039
我们在水底啊
We're underwater.

72
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,045
你来这里到底干嘛呢
What the hell are you doing here?

73
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,050
你怎么被捉到的呢
How'd you get caught?

74
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:16,047
-我回来找你的  -找我干嘛
- I came back to get you. - Came back go get me for what?

75
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,046
Jack在哪
Where's Jack

76
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:21,020
Jack要去引爆一颗氢弹
Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

77
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,006
他干嘛那么做
Why the hell would he do that?

78
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,053
那有什么影响吗  我们得阻止他
Does it matter? We have to stop him.

79
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,014
对不起  我帮不了你
Sorry, I'm gonna pass.

80
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,003
你听到我说什么了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

81
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,090
我听到你说的了  只是你不明白  Kate
Yeah, I heard you. You just don't get it, Kate.

82
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,051
我们在达摩组织很开心  直到你们出现
We we happy in dharmaville till y'all showed up.

83
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,026
不过这一切都结束了
But now that's all over.

84
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,053
所以我们会喝了这药
So we're gonna drink our O.J.

85
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:49,096
回到现实社会去碰碰运气
And take our chances in the real world.

86
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,060
Jack想把岛炸飞
Jack wants to blow up the island?

87
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:57,017
对Jack说是好事
Good for jack.

88
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,051
我们要移动一颗10吨重的炸弹
Is there anything in there about how we're supposed to move

89
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:04,042
穿越这座岛  有什么看法吗
A 10-ton bomb across the island?

90
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,079
实际上是20吨重
Actually, it's 20 tons.

91
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,099
幸运的是  看起来Faraday没有打算
Fortunately, it seems that Faraday

92
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:11,053
整个移动这个庞然大物
Never intended to freight the device in its entirety.

93
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,002
什么
What?

94
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,093
他写了详细介绍
He left detailed instructions

95
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,021
来解释如何除去钚核心
On how to remove the Plutonium core...

96
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,095
如何引爆它
And how to detonate it.

97
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,026
Faraday告诉我说我们要消除
Faraday told me that we needed to wipe out

98
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,052
某种能量袋
Some kind of pocket of energy.

99
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,046
只有一部分的炸弹的话足够吗
Is only part of the bomb gonna be enough to do that?

100
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:31,096
核心部分是一个热核武器 足够了
The core itself is a thermonuclear weapon. It'll be more than enough.

101
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,039
等等
Hey! hey! Wait.

102
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:41,026
我们20年前把它封起来
We sealed that thing up 20 years ago,

103
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,028
然后我们藏到地下 就因为它会释放核辐射
And we put it underground Because it was emitting radiation.

104
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,031
-这会是个好主意吗  Eloise  -Richard
- Does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise? - Richard

105
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,074
-你怀孕了  -所以我们才要 帮他们做好这事
- You're pregnant. -Which is exactly why We have to help him see this through

106
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,065
一旦核心移除后
Once the core is removed,

107
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,077
然后怎么办
Then what?

108
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,082
然后我们有大约2个小时
Then we have approximately two hours

109
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,072
-来把它带到天鹅站  -2个小时
- To take it to the swan site. - Two hours?

110
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:03,016
当Faraday回到岛上的时候
When Faraday returned to the island,

111
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:06,000
他很清楚这个时间表
He was very explicit about his timetable.

112
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,063
那么  我们最好快点
Well then... we'd better get movin'.

113
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:23,009
谁要你们停下来不钻的
Who stopped the damn drill?!

114
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,035
我说的
I did.

115
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:28,084
-为什么  -因为当我们超过70米时
- Why? - Because when we passed 70 meters,

116
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:29,093
钻头的温度上升到了60度
The drill temp went up 60 degrees,

117
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,039
所以我不希望看到它融化掉
And I didn't want it to melt.

118
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,049
Pierre  所以我们才准备了一卡车水
Well, Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water.

119
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,023
所以让它冷却  再启动它
So cool it down and turn it on.

120
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:38,075
Stuart  我们刚把所有无关的人
Stuart, we've just evacuated the island

121
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,013
撤离了这岛
Of all nonessential personnel.

122
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,098
我们可能陷于造反的局面当中
We're in the midst of a possible insurrection.

123
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:44,036
你真以为现在是个最好的时机
Do you really think this is the ideal time

124
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,046
-来做你的实验吗  -我干这个项目
- For your experiments? - I've been working

125
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
有足足六年了
On this project for 6 years.

126
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:49,069
去设计一个只有在梦想中才能
Designing a station that'll be able

127
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:52,047
操控电磁场的设备
To manipulate electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.

128
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,053
你有没有想过钻入那个孔 会有什么后果吗
Have you thougt about the consequence Of drilling into that pocket?!

129
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,063
我们不知道会
We have no idea what we are going to

130
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,050
如果爱迪生担心试验后果
If Edison was only worried the consequences,

131
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,044
我们现在还处于黑暗中呢
We'd all still be sitting in the dark.

132
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,012
我来这岛上是要改变世界的  Pierre
I came to this island to change the world, Pierre.

133
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,092
我绝对会这么做的
That's exactly what I'm intend to to.

134
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,063
赶紧启动吧
Let's get it started!

135
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,053
三十年后
Thirty years later.

136
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,080
大家休息一下
Take five, everybody.

137
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,021
我们离Jacob住处还有段距离
We still got ways to go to get to Jacob's.

138
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,013
谁是Jacob
Who's Jacob?

139
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,040
他管这个岛
He's in charge of this island.

140
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,011
你曾说是John管
You said John was in charge.

141
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,045
不  我说的是  他是领导着
No, I said he was the leader...

142
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,043
他有这称号的时间可真是短啊
A title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary.

143
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,075
每个人向某人负责
But everyone answers to someone,

144
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,034
领导者向Jacob负责
And the leader answers to Jacob.

145
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,005
他长什么样
What's he like?

146
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,081
我不知道  Sun  我从没见过他
I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.

147
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,037
你盯着我有10分钟了  Richard
You've been staring for the last ten minutes, Richard.

148
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,061
有什么要问我的吗
Is there something you would like to ask me?

149
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,020
Ben说他把你掐死了
Ben told me that... he strangled you.

150
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,063
的确是的
That is my recollection, yes.

151
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,077
他说他确信你死了
He said he was sure you were dead.

152
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,078
他看见你的棺材被抬上
He saw your coffin loaded onto that plane

153
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:45,066
送你来的那飞机  你怎么还活着
That you came back on. How are you alive?

154
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,089
你在这岛上的时间 比我久得多  Richard
Well, you've been on this island Much longer than I have, Richard.

155
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:52,000
如果有人能解释这事的话 我想那一定是你
If anyone should have an explanation, I'd think it would be you.

156
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:56,010
我是一直在这
I-I have been here a long time John.

157
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:59,082
见过这岛上很多 我无法描述的事情
And i've seen things on this island That I can barely describe.

158
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:03,016
但我没见过谁能重生
But... i've never seen someone come back to life.

159
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:06,022
我也没见过谁能不衰老
And i've never seen anyone who doesn't age.

160
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:08,051
这不意味着这不存在
It doesn't mean it can't happen.

161
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,057
是Jacob使我这样的
I'm this way because of Jacob.

162
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,090
我猜
And if I had to guess,

163
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,099
也是他使你不在棺材里的
He's the reason you're not in that coffin anymore.

164
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,028
我完全同意  Richard
I agree completely, Richard.

165
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,054
这正是我这么做的原因  去感谢他
That's why i'm doing this... so I can thank him.

166
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,041
一旦我做完了  我们就要去
And once I've done that, we're gonna need to deal with

167
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:27,066
解决那架送我来的飞机上的
The rest of the passengers from the ajira flight

168
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,080
其他乘客
That brought me here.

169
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,083
-"解决"是什么意思  -你知道我什么意思
- What do you mean, "deal with"? - You know what I mean.

170
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,004
走吧
Let's go!

171
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,087
松开那箱子
Untie the crates.

172
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:11,083
-为什么带上这粗鲁的家伙  -我们可能需要他
- Why'd we even bring this yahoo? - Becae we might need him.

173
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:14,079
哪里需要  他不知道问题的答案
For what? he didn't know the answer to the question.

174
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,098
那不意味着他不重要
That doesn't mean he's not important.

175
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,052
怎么  你认为他是个候选人吗
What, you think he's a candidate?

176
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,070
他醒着
He's awake.

177
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,022
你偷听多久了
How long you been listening to us?

178
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:34,017
久到让我在想  我究竟是什么候选人
Long enough to wonder what the hell i'm a candidate for.

179
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,013
-你们到底是什么人  -你朋友
- Who the hell are you people? - We're friends.

180
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,029
你会用步枪打你朋友的脸
So you smack all your friends in the face with a rifle,

181
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,086
并推进船里绑架吗
Shove 'em in a boat and kidnap 'em?

182
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,083
只对我们喜欢的人这么做
Only the ones we like.

183
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,087
盒子里是什么
What's in the box?

184

你改变不了的
And there ain't nothin' you can do to change that.

205
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,026
已成定局
What's done is done.

206
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,029
答应我你不要写完这封信
Now promise me you're not gonna finish that letter.

00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,009
一个叫John Locke的人

249
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:13,033
走进我们的营地里
He walked right into our camp,

250
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,081
说他将成为我们的领导者
And he told me that he was gonna be our leader.

251
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,099
那以后我离开过这岛三次
Now i've gone off the island three times since then

252
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:25,039
可我看他没有三头六臂啊

253
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,013
你说你有个问题
You said you had a question.

254
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,041

257
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,056
我要是你的话  就不会怀疑他的能耐
And if i were you, i wouldn't give up on him.

258
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,024

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,068
Richard  你为什么没告诉他我对于Jacob的计划
Richard. why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?

261
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,013
John  如果你是指谋杀他的"计划"
If by "plans" you mean murdering him, John,

262
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:12,027
我想你还是不想声张的
I assume you'd want to keep that a secret.

263
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,024
你怎么没说呢
When did that ever stop you?

264
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,028
自从我女儿威胁我说
Well, I started thinking differently about things

265
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,048
要是我不对你言听计从  就会把我粉身碎骨
When my dead daughter threatened to destroy me

我的思维模式就开始转变了
If i did't do everything you said.

267
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:25,075
等等  等等
Whoa. w-w-wait. wait.

268
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,049
这是哪里发生的事
Where did this happen?

269
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,013
就在那个神殿底下的洞穴里
In that cavern beneath the temple,

270
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:33,036
正是我们去找那个怪物的时候
When we went to see the monster.

So...

272

我说什么你都会服从
You're willing to do whatever I say

273
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:42,005
无论我下的是什么指令
No matter what it is?

274
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:45,014
没错
Yes.

275
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,019
那好
Well, then...

276
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,066
我就不必非得说服你了
I guess I won't have to convince you after all.

277
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,087
说服我什么
Convince me to do what?

278
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:00,075
Ben  我不会杀Jacob
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

279
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,048
你来动手
You are.

280
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,078
-巴黎还是罗马  -不

282
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,071
-有所谓  -只要我们在一起就好

I'm sorry. I think i'm lost. are you from Los Angeles?

287
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,051
-你要去哪里  -找到啦
- What are you looking for? - I found them.

288

00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:44,071
Jack  别以为自己大权在握
Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here.

298
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,008
我打头阵
I'll go first.

299
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,062
因为如果里面有危险人物
Because if someone at that house is a threat,

300
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:50,041
你会迟疑  而我不会
You might hesitate... but I won't.

301

302
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,070
一旦我们给你发出"一切安全"的指令
Once we give you the "alllear,"

303
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:58,013
你就带上炸弹
Then you bring the bomb.

304
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:01,067
我们不想发生任何意...
We don't want any acci...oh!

305
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:03,054
你干什么傻事
What the hell are you doing?

306
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:06,031
我在保护我们的领导  后退
I'm protecting our leader. get back.

307
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,082
她醒来时一定会气急败坏
She's gonna be angry when she wakes up,

308
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:12,056
可那也总比她丧命强
But that's a lot better than being dead.

309
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,036
她命令我助你一臂之力  我们帮了你
She ordered me to help you. We helped you.

310
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,080
现在你该靠自己了
Now you're on your own.

311
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,006
我得带她原路返回
And I'm taking her out the way we came in.

312
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,071
你先走
After you.

313
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:52,011
所有居民注意  现在是黑色警戒
All residents, we are in a code black.

314
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,098
立即带上武器
Report with your weapons

315
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,010
去安保分派处报告
To your security assignments immediately.

316
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,075
如果你们遇到敌人
If you come into contact with a hostile,

317
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,082
可以使用致命武器
You are authorized to use deadly force.

318
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:05,086
我们该怎么离开这里
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

319
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,033
快  没时间了
Go! we don't have time!

320
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,059
我们混如人群
We hide in plain sight.

321
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,012
先在兵营周围设置一条警戒线
Set up a perimeter around the barracks first.

322
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,087
你去那边大门守卫  你去带两个
You gonna go over there by the gate. you get two...

323
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,097
你们俩去  你们去塔桥
So you guys go. you go to pylons.

324
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,035
我们去那里集中
We're gathering over there.

325
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,023
你就是那个杀我孩子的杂种
You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid.

326
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,041
别开枪
Don't fire that weapon.

327
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,051
我携带着核装置
I'm carrying a nuclear device.

328
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,040
快走
Hey! let's go!

329
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,039
从太阳的照射角度看
From the looks of the sun,

330
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:13,027
前面是北海岸
I'd say that's the north shore over there.

331
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,060
太阳在那边  那里应该是西海岸
Sun's over there. that's gotta be the west coast.

332
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:20,067
-真的吗  难道你有指南针吗  -没有  你有吗
- Really? what, you got a compass? -No. do you?

333
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,013
谢谢
Thank you.

334
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,094
在潜水艇里
For backing me up at the sub.

335
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,004
这没什么
No problem.

336
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,083
我压根不知道我们这是到了哪里
I got no idea where the hell we are.

337
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,013
Vincent  过来
Vincent! come here! hey!

338
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:04,014
你好吗  孩子
How you doing, boy?

339
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,071
那些带火的弓箭出现后我就没见过你
Since the flaming arrows three years ago. hi!

340
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,094

How you doing? how did he survive alone out here?

341
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,094
不
Oh, hell, no.

342
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,091
Bernard
Bernard!

343
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:33,087
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

344
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,040
那是个炸弹吗
Is that a bomb?!

345
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,076
别动  我得帮你止血
Try not to move. I need to stop the bleeding.

346
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,011
-发生什么事了  Sayid还好吗  -他很好
- What's going on back there?Is Sayid okay?- Yes,he looks ok.

347
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,076
你只管注意前面的路吧
Just keep your eyes on the damn road!

348
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,062
-我要不要停车  -停车
- Should I pull over? yeah, - Let's pull over

349
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,007
然后等着枪林弹雨  你就管开车吧
and get shot. Just drive.

350
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,024
我不知道我们的目的地是哪里
I don't know where we're going.

351
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,065
天鹅站  去天鹅站
The swan site.　Head the swan.

352
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,020
你为什么想去那里  Sayid要是枪击  何不去
Why do you want to go there? if Sayid's shot, shouldn't we...

353
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:59,024
Hurley  如果你还想救Sayid

Jack  天鹅站有什么  我找到办法
Jack, what's at the swan? I think I found

356
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:05,004
可以让你回到你妻子身边

住在小屋里
And living out in a hut by yourselves.

359
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:17,019
人们一直都想
people try the whole life

360
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,095
为自己在海边找到一个宁静
To get themselves a nice, quiet place near the ocean

361
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,031
的归属  我们找到了
Where they can live in peace. and we did it.

362
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,088
这就是我们的家
That's what we made for ourselves.

363
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,064
我不是想泼你冷水
Well, i hate to rain on your parade, but...

364
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,080
不过  你的高级公寓马上就会毁了
Your condo's about to go ka-blooey.

365
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:32,039
Jack有个炸弹
Jack has a bomb.

366
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,063
管他呢
Who cares?

367
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:35,012
什么
Excuse me?

368
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:37,085
你们一直都会有这事那事
It's always something with you people.

369
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:40,056
你现在说Jack有个炸弹

你们想去阻止他  对吗

371
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,099
是的  没错
Yeah, that's right.

372
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:47,074
我们回到了30年前

00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:50,039
可你们还是要枪茅以对
And you're still trying to find ways to shoot each other?

374
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,000
Rose  我们只要知道
Rose, we just need to know

375
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,042
达摩的设施从这里怎么去
Which way the dharma barracks are from here

376
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,096
就可以阻止Jack了
So we can stop jack,

377
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,032
要么就只有等死
Or you're gonna be dead.

378
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:02,015
所有的人都会死
We all will.

379
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:03,048
那就死好了
So we die.

380
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,038
我们只关心能不能在一起
We just care about being together.

381
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:13,076
这对我们是最重要的
That's all that matters in the end.

382
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,020
设施在那边的5英里以外
The barracks are 5 miles that way.

383
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,048
Bernard  Sawyer
Bernard. Sawyer.

384
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,053
Rose
Rose.

385
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,012

真的不喝杯茶吗
You sure don't want some tea?

387
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:44,027
下次吧
Maybe another time.

388
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,025
但愿你永远也不要让我看那盒子的东西
I wish you'd never showed me what was in this damn box.

389
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,018
你到底要用它干什么
What the hell you gonna do with it anyway?

390
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,024
我们要把它拿给一个人看
We need to show it to somebody.

391
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,050
为什么
What for?

392
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:09,010
这样他们就知道面临什么了
So they'll know what they're up against.

393
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,018
他们到底面临什么了
What exactly are they up against?

394
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:12,083
比箱子里的东西
something a hell

395
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,044
更可怕  Frank
Than what's in this box, frank.

396
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:18,057
不过别担心  只要跟我们在一起  你就没事
Don't worry, though. as long as you're with us, you're fine.

397
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,067
如果我知道你们是谁的话  我会更确信你是"朋友"
That's be reassuring if i knew who you were, "friend."

398
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,031
我们是好人
We are the good guys.

399
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,067
通常状况下  当一个人告诉你
In my experience, the people who go out of their way

400
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:30,090
他是好人  那他一定是坏人
To tell you that the good guys are the bad guys.

401
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:36,021
我们到了
We're here.

402
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:51,030
快看那些灰

感觉怎么样

404
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:27,017
你渴吗

405
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,031
有人来看你

406
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,017
我向他解释你的病情

407
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:35,067
可他还是坚持要见你

408
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:40,041
没人来探望过你  这会对你有帮助

409
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:57,074
抱歉我无法早点来

410
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,084
很高兴见到你

411
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:08,025
我在这是因为我需要你帮忙

415
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:23,071
他不在这 他好长时间没在这里了
He isn't there, hasn't been in a long time.

416
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,018
有其他人来过
Someone else has been using it.

417
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:31,014
烧了它
Burn it!

418
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,040
我不是环保主义者
I'm no tree hugger or anything,

419
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:39,065
不过把房子烧了可能会引起森林大火
But that's a pretty good way to torch the whole jungle,

420
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:40,036
你觉得呢
Don't you think?

421
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,031
我想我们知道该去哪了
Well, i guess we know where we're going.

422
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:46,072
这是我们原先的营地
This is our old camp.

423
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:49,007
可爱的家
Home sweet home.

424
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:53,070
好的  大家  Richard告诉我
All right, everyone, richard tells me

425
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,031
必须在傍晚前到达目的地
We should get to where we're going by nightfall.

426
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:56,090
那我们干嘛不趁机
So why don't you all take this opportunity

427
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,046
休息一下  喘口气呢
To rest up and catch your breath?

428
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:01,000
考虑到我的计划
Considering what i have planned

429
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,033
大家有必要休息一下
for ya, you're gonna need it.

430
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,035
我在享受一个人的时光
I was enjoying some alone time.

431
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,024
看到你身后的东西了吗
You see what's behind you?

432
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,037
是一个门  怎么了
It's a door. how about that?

433
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,049
那不只是一个门  Ben
It's not just a door, ben.

434
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:35,017
那是我们第一次见面时  那个船舱的门
It's the door to the hatch where you and i first met.

435
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:41,003
介意我问你一个问题吗
You mind if i ask you a question?

436
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:42,049
我是双鱼座的
I'm a pisces.

437
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:46,012
那天在船舱里发生什么了
What happened that day at the cabin,

438
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,067
就是你第一次带我去见Jacob那天
When you first took me to meet jacob?

439
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,025
你可能已经知道了
Well, you clearly already know

440
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:56,063
我当时对着一张空椅子说话  John
That i was talking to an empty chair, john...

441
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,095
那是我假装的
That i was pretending.

442
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:05,076
当那些东西在屋子里飞舞的时候
Which is not to say that i wasn't as surprised as you were

443
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:09,000
我跟你一样惊讶
When things started flying around in the room.

444
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,099
但是为什么你一去
But why would you go to all the trouble

445
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:12,062
就发生了这些
To make something like that up?

446
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:18,049
我很尴尬
I was embarrassed.

447
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:23,048
我并不想让你知道我从没见过Jacob
I didn't want you to know that i had never seen jacob.

448
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:29,011
没错  我撒谎了
So, yes, i lied.

449
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,017
这就是我做的
That's what i do.

450
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:41,019
好的
All right, then.

451
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,057
那你为什么让我杀了Jacob  John
Why do you want me to kill jacob, john?

452
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,062
因为
Because...

453
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:53,088
尽管你一直是岛上的忠实仆人
Despite your loyal service to this island,

454
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:55,001
可是你得了癌症
You got cancer...

455
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:59,042
你不得不看着你的女儿
You had to watch your own daughter gunned down

456
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,005
在你的面前倒下
Right in front of you.

457
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:05,021
这就是你的这些牺牲所给你的报酬吗
And your reward for those sacrifices?

458
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,052
你被驱逐了
You were banished.

459
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:10,044
你以一个你从没见过的人
And you did all this

460
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,056
的名义做了所有这些事
In the name of a man you'd never even met.

461
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,013
Ben  所以问题应该是
So the question is, ben,

462
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,092
为什么你不想杀了Jacob
Why the hell wouldn't you wanna kill jacob?

463
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,050
从我们相见的那一天开始

464
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,016
我就爱上了你

465
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:35,089
我将用我的一生

466
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:39,042
去爱你

467
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:46,065
以此为证

468
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,076
我的写在纸上了

469
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:08,032
我们将永不分离

470
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:11,008
因为我们如果分开

471
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:13,077
就好像天空离开了大地

472
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:24,096
以此戒为证

473
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,094
你们打算什么时候要小孩

474
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:51,098
可能等我们度蜜月的时候

475
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,050
祝福你们

476
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:06,014
你们的爱是一件特别的事情

477
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:10,068
不要忽视它

478
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:20,061
那是谁

479
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,023
不知道  不过他的韩语好

480
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,008
还有多久
How much further?

481
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:40,097
还要5分钟
Uh, we're about five minutes away.

482
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,016
你无法止住血
You can't stop the bleeding.

483
00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:46,096
给我干净的绷带
I need fresh dressings.

484
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:48,089
Jack  这个炸弹会怎么样
Jack, so this bomb is supposed

485
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:51,022
我们不回去
We're not going back in time.

486
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:54,000
对  因为根本不可能
Right, because that would be ridiculous.

487
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,021
我需要改装一下炸弹
I need to modify the bomb.

488
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,066
我可以让它受到冲击就爆炸
I can rig it so it detonates on impact.

489
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:02,005
Jack  我们一定要在事情发生的那一刻赶到
Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the incident.

490
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:04,082
否则一切都功亏一篑
Or all of this will be for nothing.

491
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:09,033
怎么停下了
Why the hell are we stopping?

492
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,003
看
That's why.
