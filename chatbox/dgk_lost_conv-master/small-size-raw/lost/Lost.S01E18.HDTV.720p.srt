3
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:26,008
在这儿了 这就是我们的当务之急
Right now, this is our priority.

4
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:34,098
Danielle 你是怎么来这个岛的?
How did you come to be on this island, Danielle?

5
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,027
船撞在了岩石上 搁浅了
The ship slammed into rocks,ran aground.

6
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,054
等一下 伙计 你现在要什么?
Hold on a second, dude.You want what now?

7
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,040
你想做雪球?
You wanna make snowballs?

8
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,040
他要你抱紧那些竹子
Hold the bamboo tighter.

9
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,014
我认为是这样的
I think.

10
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,015
干得怎样了?
How's it coming?

11
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:12,031
不错
It's coming.

12
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,054
只要没有人搞破坏就行了 是吗?
Long as nobody sabotages this one as well, huh?

13
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:17,058
我让人24小时守着了
I got people standing guard 24/7.

14
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,019
任何企图想破环的或没这企图的人都进不来
Nobody gets near this,with or without intent to burn.

15
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:22,024
听着 我一直在想
I was thinking, uh,the chances of a passing ship

16
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,053
过往的船只看到这只救生艇的机会很小
spotting this raft out there is pretty slim.

17
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,050
我们能用点什么
We could use something to send a distress call

18
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,025
给可能在这附近的船只送去遇险信号
to any ship that might be close.

19
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,033
就像S.O.S.
Like an SOS.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,000
好的 听着 我会去找Sayid的
OK. I'll ask Sayid,

21
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:34,068
但是就算他能做出一些那样的东西
but even if he could make something like that,

22
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,060
他也没有能源能使它运行
he's not gonna have anything to power it with.

23
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:39,069
Sayid没说过那个疯狂的法国女人有电池吗?
Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick had batteries?

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,073
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,098
-我没有叫你去  -我会去的
-I'm not asking you to go.  -I'll do it.

26
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:48,001
伙计 我们只是...
We're trying...

27
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,043
你们真的以为她会放弃一些生存的必需品吗
Do you think she would give up something

28
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,062
而且是给一个完全的陌生人?
she needs to a stranger?

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,097
我所问的只是让你告诉我怎么找到她 只有这些
All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her. That's it.

30
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,091
我被带去她的营地时已经是人事不省了
I was brought unconscious to her camp.

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,052
当我逃出时 我更象是一只无头苍蝇  我不知道怎么找到她
I was disoriented. I don't know how to find her.

32
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:02,038
不知道 伙计 还是不想说?
Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?

33
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,065
Sayid 听着 你有她的地图和一些纸张
Sayid, look. You've got her maps and her papers.

34
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,092
并且你认为它们能代表什么
You thought they were pointing to something.

35
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,019
可能那些纸张和地图可以让我们找到她呢
Maybe they're pointing to her.

36
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:13,074
听着 我甚至不知这些纸张说明了什么
Look! I don't know what these papers mean!

37
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:16,036
我只知道 它们可能是她脑子不清时的胡言乱语
They could be the ravings of her disturbed mind.

38
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,060
夹杂着方程式的歌词
Song lyrics, mixed with equations!

39
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,060
如果这张地图能找到她
If this map is pointing to her,

40
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,063
那么你得知道她住在这里 在这块区域
then you should know she resides here in this area.

41
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:32,002
她给那地方取名为 Territoire Fonce
She gave it a name."Territoire Fonce. "

42
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:35,096
Shannon翻译后说它意思是黑暗的领土
Shannon translated it.It means "Dark Territory."

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,092
那听起来像是一个你想去的地方吗?
That sound like a place you'd like to visit?

44
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,015
这么说你不帮忙了?
So you won't help?

45
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,057
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

46
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:43,041
我会造一座代表我们遇险的灯塔
I'll build the distress beacon.

47
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,057
但是我建议你去找另外的能源
I suggest you find another power source.

48
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,056
驾驶员舱里肯定会有些什么
Something in the cockpit.

49
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,040
我们不去驾驶员舱
We're not going to the cockpit.

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,047
Hugo你在那儿做什么?
What are you doing in there?

51
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,040
没什么 妈妈 只是看点东西
Uno momento, mama.I'm just checking something out.

52
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,097
我希望你别再看那些不良节目了
I hope you're not watching those G-string mujeres again.

53
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,050
听着 妈 我们来谈谈这个
Look, Ma, we talked about this.

54
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,040
你想让我住在这儿 你就得尊重我的隐私
If you want me living here,you gotta respect my privacy.

55
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,040
况且 我没在看
And no, I'm not.

56
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,094
看看你
Look at you.

57
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:19,007
周六晚上
It's Saturday night.

58
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:23,014
一个成年人坐在家里看电视
A grown-up man sitting at home watching TV.

59
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,066
你应该出去 试着帮你自己找个好女人
You should go out.Try to find yourself a nice woman.

60
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:28,044
好的 我会去的
I'll get right on that.

61
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:31,064
至少试着吃得好一点 你又胖了
Try eating better.You're gaining weight again.

62
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,028
大的号码是 42
with the Mega Number 42.

63
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,054
那就产生了今晚百万彩票的大奖
And that makes tonight's Mega Lotto Jackpot Drawing

64
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:43,070
4 8 15

65
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:48,047
16 和 23 加上一个大号码42
16 and 23 with the Mega Number 42.

66
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,004
谁有了这个号码就是赢家
Whoever has those numbers has won

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,098
否则奖金就会累积到下次中奖
or will share in a near record jackpot.

68
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:58,003
是的 Mary Jo 因为已经16周没有人得奖了
That's right, Mary Jo,because this is the sixteenth week without a winner.

69
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,073
你醒了?
You awake?

70
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:20,074
我只是对自己感到惊讶
I was just wondering that myself.

71
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,080
那么 那个法国女士 她写了这些 对么?
That French lady wrote this stuff?

72
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:29,001
Hurley 半夜三更的 你想干什么?
It's the middle of the night.What do you want?

73
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,067
睡不着
Couldn't sleep.

74
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,046
我很好奇
And I got curious.

75
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,016
你和Shannon...
You and Shannon,

76
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:38,091
你们一直试着指出这些东西 并且
you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff,

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,003
我想知道... 你知道
and I was wondering what...

78
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,021
你们指出了...
you guys figured out

79
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,035
这些东西
about this stuff?

80
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,015
-哪些东西?  -我不知道
-What stuff?  -I don't know.

81
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,017
看看这些她花了点时间写下的数字
Well, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times.

82
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,073
知道它说明什么么?
Got any idea what it means?

83
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,066
我认为在某时他们可能等价于什么
I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,018
等价 是的
Coordinates, yeah.

85
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,077
你第一次找到她...
But when you first found her,

86
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,017
那法国女人...
the French chick,

87
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:12,017
你说你在沙滩上看见了一条金属线或是什么
you said you saw a wire or something on the beach.

88
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:14,096
然后你沿着它 找到了她
You followed it, and it led you to her.

89
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,012
不是 它引我走进了一个她设的陷阱
No. It led me into a trap she set.

90
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,089
但是她的地方也不远了 是么?
But her place is probably close, right?

91
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,057
为什么你突然对Rousseau这么感兴趣?
Why are you interested in Rousseau?

92
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,059
我没有
I'm not.

93
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:27,018
只是 你知道 谈谈话 伙计
Just making conversation, dude.

所以我拿这些钱来做的第一件事

114
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:33,062
就是给他他以后所赚的全部的钱

因为对我来说十分重要的
That's what it's all about for me,

116

就是为我关心的人做些什么

117

我只能在沙滩上摇摇晃晃地走
I can barely waddle to the beach.

151

可能吧

在哪儿?
Where is it?

159
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,014
什么在哪儿?
Where's what?

160
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,023
地图 我告诉过你它对你找到她没有作用
The map. It won't help you find her.

161
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,046
那张地图不在我这儿
I don't have it.

162
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,098
更坏的是这卑鄙勾当不是你自己干的
What's worse is you won't do your own dirty work.

163
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,099
-你让Hurley帮你做  -等等
-You get Hurley to do it.  -Wait a minute.

164
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,039
Hurley?

165
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,027
他昨晚在我的帐篷里向我盘问关于Rousseau的事情

00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,081
关于她写的数字

167

你什么都不知到 是不是?
You don't know anything about this, do you?

169
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:22,056
Charlie.

170
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,088
你看到Hurley了么?

171
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,092
几个小时前 他散步去了
Couple of hours ago.He was setting out for a walk.

172
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,070
像个笨蛋一样 我得说明
Acting like a loon, I might add.

173
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,043
天那 他去追踪她了

你担心我?
Are you worried about me?

00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,085
如果我是呢?
So what if I am?

178
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,034
Sayid!

179
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,026
准备好了么?
You ready?

Hugo 把那噪音关掉
Hugo, turn that noise down.

抱歉

你会喜欢这样的 妈
You're gonna like this one, Ma.

186
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:32,035
我是说 当你经历了所有事情之后

187
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,084
就像爷爷
like Grandpa

Diego在Lisa离开他跟着那个招待跑了之后搬会了家

从我中了彩票大奖之后 就像...

196
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,088
我们除了坏运气还是坏运气

钱的诅咒还是什么
the money's cursed or something.

199
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,072
胡说八道
That's blasphemy.

00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:19,067
你知道我们是天主教徒 我们不相信诅咒
You know we are Catholic.We don't believe in curses.

201

好了 我们快到了 来 穿上这个

我的脚踝  我的脚踝 
My ankle.My ankle.

210
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,073
我说过你可以拿下你的眼罩了
I said take off your blindfold.

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,024
你起先为什么要我带上呢?
Why did you make me put that thing on?

212
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,034
Hugo 是有烟味么?

213
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,045

放下电话 远离车子

没有诅咒这一说 是么 妈?
No such thing as curses, Ma?

220
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,036
你有权力保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

221
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,099
但是你所说的一切
Anything you say can and will

222
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,023
将成为呈堂证供
be used against you.

223
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,017
法国女人!

227

留下的桔色的流星焰火感兴趣

228
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:24,047
并且你现在是Tustin一家制盒公司的股东
And you are now the majority shareholder for a box company in Tustin.

229
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,040
一家制盒公司?

230
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,093

有利的事业 每个人都需要盒子

Which reminds me,

00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,066
你在加拿大的运动鞋厂...

上月在一场火中毁了
It was destroyed in a fire last month.

当然是这样了
Of course it was.

238
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:46,026
你可以认为是胡说八道 死了八个人
You might have read about it.Eight-something people died.

239
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,079
但是好消息是我们给这件事做了过保
But the good news is,we over-insured it.

240
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,069
这将使你发一笔横财

241

我们把它添加到从LAPD得来的有关你被非法拘留

厄运
Bad luck.

246
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:07,067
Hugo 不只一个中彩票大奖的人
Hugo.You are not the first lottery winner to believe

247
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:10,008
会认为钱给他们带来的只是厄运
the money's brought nothing but trouble.

248
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,027
这些只是你脑子里想想的
It's all in your head.

249
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,092
什么 你不相信不详物这一说?
What, you don't believe in jinxes?

250

就像 诅咒?
You know, curses?

251
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,097
我是一个会计 我相信数字
I'm an accountant. I believe in numbers.

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,083
你从哪儿得到他们的?
where'd you get them, anyway?

253
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,057
什么?
What?

254
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,062
大奖号码 你用了...
The winning numbers. What'd you use...

255

某人的生日? 电话号码
Somebody's birthday? Phone number.

256
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,069
不是 这只是一些...
Nah, it's nothing. It's just something that I

257
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,055
-什么?  -就是了
-What?  -That's it.

258
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:36,061
这不是钱的问题 是号码的问题
It's not the money. It's the numbers.

259
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,025
这是被诅咒的号码
The numbers are cursed.

260
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:42,026
伙计 别这么看着我 我没疯 这真的是...
Dude, don't look at me like that. I'm not crazy. This is really

261
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,014
好了 Hugo 听你自己的 "钱是被诅咒的"
Come on, Hugo, listen to yourself. "The numbers are cursed."

262
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,073
你知道不会发生这些事 就像是...
You know there is no such thing as a

263
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,025
你要撞得更狠一些么?
You want to hit that a little harder?

264
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,053
抱歉
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:09,053
我在做救我们命的逃生艇打扰了你么?
Is my building a raft to get us rescued bothering you?

266
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,014
就现在来说 是的
At the moment, yeah.

267
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,034
你为什么不来帮忙?
Why aren't you helping?

268
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,027
我正在帮忙...防着纵火犯
I am helping, short round...keeping watch for arsonists.

269
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,028
Walt说对了
Walt's got a point.

270
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:20,032
你可以更努力点
You could pitch in,

271
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,036
好像你已经买了逃生票一样
seeing as how you've already bought your ticket.

272
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:28,073
你是照我说的那样绑得么?
Did you tie this like I told you?

273
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,094
因为如果你是像我说的那样绑好了的话  那些东西就不会散了
'Cause if you'd have tied it like I said, the thing would still be together!

274
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:36,033
你怎么了? 你在想什么?
What's the matter with you? What is your problem?

275
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,025
他不会再和我说话了
He's never going to speak to me again.

276
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,024
他需要的是时间
He just needs time.

277
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,017
我让他丢脸了
I humiliated him.

278
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:58,020
当救生艇起航时...
When the raft sails...

279
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:02,046
你认为他会和他们一起走么?
do you think he's going to leave with them?

280
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,056
我不知道
I don't know.

281
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,070
别动
Don't move!

282
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,052
-你们这些家伙...  -Hurley 别动

283
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:53,044
你正站在一个压力触发机上
You're standing on a pressure trigger.

284
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:57,006
如果你走开 那个就会发射出来
If you take your weight off it, it will release that.

285
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,051
天那

286
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,028
我们得找一些东西替代他的体重
We need to find something to replace his weight on the trigger.

代替他的体重? 我们能做到么?
Replace his weight? How are we going to do that?

288
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,005
别动

00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:12,045
大家冷静一下
Everybody, just calm down.

290
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,068
我能放下这根线么?

291
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,081
-也许我能找到块岩石  -是的 大一点的

292
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,097
-我要把线放了  -Hurley 不
-I'm dropping the wire.  -Hurley, no!

293
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:21,064
我能做到
I can make it.

294
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,086

我能逃掉的 我很敏捷
I can get out of the way. I'm spry.

296

没什么
Nothing.

300
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,095
你在这儿干什么 伙计?

I can't very well look it up.

314

How many Leonards are here?

315
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,052
只是...你不能只是打入"Leonard"?

316
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:29,060
我是说 这家伙就像永远呆在这儿了 他认识我
I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me.

Hugo

Hurley

我只是 你知道 在附近 而且 
I was just, you know,in the neighborhood, and,

335
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,065
听着 Lenny 我要知道...
Look, Lenny, I got to know

336
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,093
那些号码代表着什么?

它们对你有害么?
Did they do something to you?

339
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,077
因为我觉得他们对我有害
'Cause I think they did something to me.

340

我认为他们使我变成了一个倒霉蛋

对我周围的人而言的扫把星
Bad news to everyone around me.

342

343
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,005
他们..他们看着我就像在看白痴

他们不相信我
They don't believe me.

345

自从我用这些号码赢了彩票后

它还没停下 你得远离那些号码

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,021
你难道不知道
Don't you understand?!

356

你得远离它 否则它不会停下的
You got to get away from them or it won't stop!

357

358
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,092
先生 你得离远点
Sir, you need to step away.

359
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,030
Lenny 这些号码 你从哪儿来的?
Lenny, the numbers! Where'd you get them?

360

This poses somewhat of a problem.

370

393
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,098
你就像一个嗜血的疯子

394
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,072
如果这不是一个荒野之地  我会说你迷路了

我想找他说些话

399
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:17,031
我也想和他说话 但是Sam已经死了4年了
I'd like that, too, but Sam's been dead for four years.

400
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:23,036
你的丈夫和我认识的一个人工作过...Leonard Simms

Sam和Leonard在一个潜听哨站岗

411
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:00,038
监视横跨太平洋的电波

无聊的工作 Sam很讨厌

有一个声音
A voice cuts through

417

像小马一样大

421
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,063
边上镶满了豆子
and it's filled to the rim with beans.

答案和豆子数刚好吻合

428
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,096
人们已经做这个游戏40年了

429
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:55,013
没有人说过接近的数字

430
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,080
所以我们赢了钱了

仅仅擦破了点皮

大部分人会认为他很幸运
Most people would consider themselves lucky,

438
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,030
但是他没有
but not him.

439
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:22,042
从那以后他变了

00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:34,003
他认为这全怪他用了那些数字

他把我们搬到了这个荒野之地  希望能停止厄运
He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere, hoping it would stop.

445
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,019
成功了么?
Did it?

446
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,068
他找到能让厄运停止的办法了么?
Did he ever find a way to make it stop?

他拿着一把短枪放入他的嘴里扣动了扳机

现在我认为我受到了相同的诅咒
And now I think I'm under the same curse.

453
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,012
诅咒?
Curse?

454
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,044
没有什么诅咒
There's no curse.

455
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,043
但你刚刚和我说...
But you just told me

456
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,016
你认为我的脚还在
You think I'd still have my leg

457
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:24,058
如果Sam没有说对豆子的确切数目的话?
if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans?

458
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:26,045
你认为那个洪水就不会爆发了?
You think that floods wouldn't have happened,

459
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,018
那个...那个房子就不会被烧毁
that...that homes wouldn't have burned down,

460
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:29,091
那些人就不会死?
that people wouldn't have died?

461
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:35,000
是的
Well, yeah.

462
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:38,097
你的命运如此 Reyes先生
You make your own luck, mr. Reyes.

463
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,058
别怪到这些混蛋的号码身上
Don't blame it on the damn numbers.

464
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:46,056
你只是在找一个并不存在的借口
You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist.

465
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,040
这是个陷阱 是么?
It's a trap, right?

466
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:56,012
为了抓动物?
For catching animals?

467
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,065
拜托给我那个杯子?
Pass me that cup, please?

468
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,070
这黏黏的是什么?
what's this gunk?

469
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,051
胶水
Glue.

470
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,012
你在哪儿找到胶水的?
Where'd you find glue?

471
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,025
我从动物的脂肪里提炼出来的
I made it out of rendered animal fat.

472
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,047
你会做胶水?
You made glue?

473
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,028
你应该开一个秀场
You should have one of those shows where you,

474
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,077
就在你为人们造房子的地方
fix up houses for people.

475
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,034
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

476
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:30,050
谢谢

477
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:34,073
为了你...给了我一些做的事情
For this --giving me something to do.

478
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,024
我 我已经厌倦了想着在那儿发生的我的那些事
I'm , tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there.

479
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,097
那些是怎么来的?
How's that coming?

480
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:48,072
你的回忆?
Your memory?

481
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,067
这儿的那儿的一些零零碎碎地小事
Bits and pieces here and there.

482
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:55,026
没什么是真正有意义的
Nothing that makes any real sense.

483
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,033
也许我能帮忙
Well, maybe I can help.

484
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:04,004
我对于将零碎的小东西凑起来很在行
I'm good at putting bits and pieces together.

485
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,058
怎么了?
What?

486
00:29:29,012 --> 00:29:31,024
这儿很眼熟 这块地方
This is familiar...this area.

487
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,075
我们接近了
We're close.

488
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:36,051
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

489
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,015
我认为她住在地下
I thought she lived underground.

490
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,033
Jack

491
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,023
那该死的是什么?
What the hell was that?

492
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:57,084
该死的防卫系统
Hell of a security system.

493
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,066
某人绊到了线 这些地方全炸开了
Somebody trips a wire, and the whole place blows up.

494
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:02,033
这儿没东西
There's nothing here.

495
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,099
-电池?  -没什么
-The batteries?  -Nothing.

496
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,039
我不懂
I don't get it.

497
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,035
她知道了
She knew.

498
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:17,016
她知道某天我会回来并且带着别人
She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others.

499
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,087
所以她放弃了这个地方
So she abandoned this place,

500
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,094
在这儿设了陷阱
booby-trapped it,

501
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:23,085
然后搬走了
and moved on.

502
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,015
搬去哪儿?
Moved on where?

503
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,013
Jack

504
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,061
Sayid

505
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,063
我们知道我们是去那儿么?
Do we even know where we're going?

506
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:35,096
爆炸的冲击波好像是从这边来的  我认为是
The blast sounded like it came from this way, I think.

507
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:37,041
但是你不知道
But you don't know.

508
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,008
伙计 你想从我这儿得到什么
Dude, what do you want from me?

509
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,055
我想要什么?
What do I want?

510
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,021
我想知道我们来这种荒野之地做什么
I wanna know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere.

511
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,054
别和我说是为了那些该死的电池
And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries.

512
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:48,026
一会儿你是个快乐开心好运的Hurley
One minute you're happy-go-luckygood-time Hurley

513
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,012
一会儿你又成了血腥讨厌呆板的Kurtz
and the next you're colonel bloody Kurtz.

514
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:52,071
这毫无道理 这不是你
It just doesn't make any sense. It's not you.

515
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,029
伙计 你不了解我
Dude, you don't know me.

516
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,027
在岛上的这么多时候  你从没和我说起过你自己
Well, all this time on the island, you've told me nothing about yourself.

517
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,068
我们都有隐私 伙计
We all got personal stuff, dude.

518
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,092
别转移话题
Don't change the subject.

519
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,048
我们在这儿迷路了
We're lost out here.

520
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,089
Jack和Sayid如果没被炸成碎片的话那肯定是受伤了
Jack and Sayid could be hurt, if not blown to bits,

521
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,012
全都怪你扮得像个血腥的疯子
all because you're acting like some bloody nutter.

522
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:11,009
我没疯
I am not crazy.

523
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:16,006
-我是有原因的 为了...  -我认为我有权利知道
-I've got my reasons for...  -I think I have a right to know.

524
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:23,068
好的 你想知道是么?
Okay. All right, you wanna know?

525
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,005
大约一年前...
About a year ago...

526
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:34,095
有人在向我们开枪?
Is someone shooting at us?

527
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:01,018
你肯定是法国女人
You must be the french chick.

528
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:03,008
-你是谁?  -Hurley
-Who are you?  -Hurley.

529
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:04,090
我
I

530
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:12,058
Sayid 那个你拷打过的人...他
Sayid...that guy you tortured...he

531
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,074
你那时在飞机上
You were on the plane.

532
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:19,048
听着 我来这是为了找...放松 别紧张 别紧张
Look, I came here to find...easy, easy. Easy.

533
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,093
我...我只是拿了你的笔记
I'm...I'm just getting your notes.

534
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,026
请...
Please...

535
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,090
你告诉我为什么你写下这些
tell me why you wrote this.

536
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,000
请告诉我这些数字代表了什么?
What do these numbers mean, please?

537
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,033
我不知道
I don't know.

538
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,001
什么?
What?

539
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,064
你不知道?
You don't know?

540
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,069
好的
Okay,

541
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,059
那个在丛林里的东西
that thing in the woods,

542
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:57,000
也许是只妖怪
maybe it's a monster,

543
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:02,027
也许是一只该死的长颈鹿 我不知道
maybe it's a pissed-off giraffe, I don't know.

544
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:07,075
那个没人在找我们的事实..
The fact that no one is even looking for us

545
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:09,082
是的 那很诡异
yeah, that's weird.

546
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,040
但是我只是去附和它
But I just go along with it

547
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:14,024
因为我赶了一程过来..
'cause I'm along for the ride...

548
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:16,066
只是为了好玩 老顽童Hurley
good old fun-time Hurley.

549
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,041
你想什么..
Well, guess what...

550
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:24,013
现在 我要一些怪异的回答
now, I want some freakin' answers!

551
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,046
我们的船截获了一串电波...
Our ship picked up a transmission...

552
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,060
一个重复着这些数字的声音
a voice repeating those numbers.

553
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,084
我们改变了计划去研究它
We changed course to investigate.

554
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,039
在我们的船只失事后
After we shipwrecked,

555
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:55,049
我的队伍继续搜寻着电波的来源
my team continued to search for the transmission source.

556
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:59,028
几周后在我们找到了电波发射塔
It was weeks before we found the radio tower.

557
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,013
岛上有电波发射塔?
There's a radio tower on this island?

558
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,029
在黑岩石上
Up by the black rock.

559
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:08,024
我们中的一些人继续着
Some of us continued

560
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,033
在等待救援的同时
to search for the meaning of those numbers

561
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,061
探索着这些号码的意义
while we waited for rescue.

562
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:16,061
但是那时 病魔袭来了
But then the sickness came.

563
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,033
当我的队伍都死了
When my team was gone,

564
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:26,098
我回到了那座塔 改变了电波
I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission.

565
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:29,069
就是我们听到的求救信号?
That distress signal we heard.

566
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,060
是的
Yes.

567
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:32,029
但是这些数字...
But the numbers...

568
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,030
你找到了有关它们的什么了么?
did you ever find out anything about them?

569
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,052
你知道它们怎么会有灵力的么?
Do you know where they got their power?

570
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,077
灵力?
Power?

571
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:47,050
它们给你周围的人带来厄运
They bring bad stuff to everyone around you.

572
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,074
它们是被诅咒的
They're cursed.

573
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,019
你是知道的 对么?
You know that, right?

574
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,044
这些号码...
The numbers...

575
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,092
它们被诅咒了
they're cursed.

576
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:59,004
我就是被这些号码带来这里的
The numbers are what brought me here.

577
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:01,074
在它出现之后
As it appears,

578
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:04,024
它们又带来了你
they brought you.

579
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,039
那之后
Since that time,

580
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:10,066
我失去了一切...
I've lost everything

581
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,045
每个我所关心的人
everyone I cared about.

582
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:17,016
那么 是的
So, yes,

583
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,086
我认为你是对的
I suppose you're right.

584
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,028
它们是被诅咒了的
They are cursed.

谢谢
Thank you.

587
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:40,093
你不会知道我为了有人赞同我
You have no idea how long I've been waiting

588
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,081
而等了多久
for someone to agree with me.

589
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,043
谢谢
Thank you.

590
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,022
上帝 谢谢你

真的太谢谢你了
Thank you so much.

592
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,074
我们得找到Hurley和Charlie
We need to find Hurley and Charlie

593
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,073
然后走出这片丛林
and get out of this jungle.

594
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:04,012
我只是不想两手空空得回去
I just hate that we're going home empty-handed.

595
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:12,074
有人朝我们开枪...
someone shot at us...

596
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,047
Hurley和我
Hurley and me.

597
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:14,076
我们正在找你 然后...
We were looking for you, and...

598
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,040
-Hurley在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where's Hurley?  -I don't know.

599
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:19,013
他本来就在我后面  然后他就...
He was right behind me, then he just...

600
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,076
他就不在了
he just wasn't.

601
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:26,043
-我去找他  -不 不 不 我们一起去
-I'll go and find him.  -No, no, no, we'll all go.

602
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,055
去哪儿?
Go where?

603
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:32,066
Hurley 该死的发生了什么事?
Hurley, what the hell happened to you?

604
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:37,036
要电池么?
Need a battery?

605
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,045
她说嘿
She says hey.

606
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,042
你想过名字了么?
You think of a name yet?

607
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:20,049
小孩的名字
For the baby.

608
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,003
我还没有好好想过

在我们成为练习射击的靶子之前

你正要告诉我
you were gonna tell me

是的 那是...
Yeah, that's...
