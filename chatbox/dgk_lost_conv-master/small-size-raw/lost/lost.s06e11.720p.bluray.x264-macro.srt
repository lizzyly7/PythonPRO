278
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,310
我睁开双眼
I open my eyes,

就那么一会 我看到那副景象了
Just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.

在你做出选择之前 你要知道 如果你留在这儿
Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here,

294
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,880

And, um, I take full responsibility...

443
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,210
不用为此担心
Don't worry about it.

444
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,640
您说什么?
Excuse me?

445
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,680
我儿子会理解的
Oh, my son will understand.

446
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,470
我觉得 假如有人雇用了所谓的摇滚明星
I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars,

447
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,010
说不准会发生些什么事呢
a certain unpredictability comes with the territory.

448
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,680
是的 您... 您不生气吗?
Yeah. Y... you're not angry?

449
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,410
哦 亲爱的 我一点都不生气
Oh, not at all, dear.

450
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,830
所有事情都是注定的
What happened, happened.

451
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,270
Hume先生 非常感谢你
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

452
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,520

For coming and telling me in person.

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,410
不好意思
Excuse me.

462
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,190
打扰一下 呃...
I'm sorry. Um...

463
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,570
你刚才有念到"Penny"这个人吗?
Did you just say "Penny"?

464
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,470
- 你是哪位?  - 喔 我是为Widmore先生办事的 我可以看一下那个名单吗?
- And who are you?  - Um, I work for Mr. Widmore. May I see the list?

465
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,250
你当然不能看了
You absolutely may not.

466
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,340
这个名单是保密的
That list is confidential.

467
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,680
请原谅
Begging your pardon,

468
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,740
我整天都在跟绝密的文件打交道...
I... I'm entrusted with confidential items every day...

469
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,180
你是在质疑我吗?
Are you questioning me?

470
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,950
不敢 我... 仅仅是想看下那个名单而已
No, I... just want to look at one name on that list.

471
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,750
- 如果有什么原因 不方便让我查看...  - 跟我来
- And if, for some reason, that's a problem...  - Come with me.

472
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,110
所有人都出去 马上
Out, everyone. Now.

473
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,210
是这样的 我...
Look, I'm...

474
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,790
如果我越权了 我向您道歉 但是我仅仅...
I'm sorry if I've overstepped my bounds, but I just...

475
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,190
住嘴吧 Hume
Stop talking, Hume.

476
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,920
我已经很清楚你在说什么了 现在你听我说
I've heard what you've had to say. Now you listen to me.

477
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,510
我要你停下来
I want you to stop.

478
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,940
停下来? 停... 停下来什么?
Stop? S... stop what?

479
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,290
很明显 已经有人影响到了你对事物的看法
Someone has clearly affected the way you see things.

480
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,260
这是个很严重的问题 事实上 这是种侵害
This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation.

481
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,760
所以不管你现在在做什么
So whatever you're doing,

482
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,980
也不管你想要追寻什么
whatever it is you think you're looking for...

483
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,030
你需要停下你追寻的脚步
you need to stop looking for it.

484
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,720
Widmore女士...
Do you...

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,050
你知道我是在追寻什么吗?
do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

486
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,990
我找不到你还需要去追寻其它东西的理由
I don't know why you're looking for anything.

487
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,690
你有完美的人生
You have the perfect life.

488
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,730
至关重要的是 你已经得到了
On top of it, you've managed to attain

489
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,610
你最渴望的东西...
the thing you wanted more than anything...

490
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,970
那就是我丈夫的赞许
My husband's approval.

491
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,540
您是如何得知我需要什么的?
How do you know what I want?

492
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,420
我就是知道
Because I bloody do.

493
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,560
我需要看看那个名单...
I need to see that list...

494
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,890
除非你告诉我 为什么我不能看
Or you need to tell me why I can't.

495
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,690
Desmond 你不能看 是因为你还没有准备好
You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.

496
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,010
准备好?
Ready?

497
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,780
准备好? 为... 什么而做好准备?
Ready? R... ready for what?

498
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,690
感觉不爽吧?
That bad, huh?

499
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,910
车里有酒吗?
Is there any alcohol in this car?

500
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,940
喔 有的
Oh, yeah.

501
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,770
应有尽有
Whatever you need.

502
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,360
那么...
So, uh...

503
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,500
Hume先生 我们前往哪里?
Where to, Mr. Hume?

504
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,170
George 你就随便开开吧
Just drive, George.

505
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,000
- Hume先生  - 什么事?
- Mr. Hume.  - Yes?

506
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,790
我的名字叫Daniel Widmore
My name is Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

507
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,490
我们谈谈吧
We need to talk.

508
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,310
听着 Widmore先生 这个...
Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...

509
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,160
Dan 直接叫我Dan就好了
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

510
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,970
"Widmore先生"是我父亲
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

511
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,380
Dan 是这样的 如果... 如果是关于Charlie Pace
Dan, um, look, if... if this is about Charlie Pace

512
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,910
无法和你同台演出这件事
not being able to perform with you,

513
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,640
我... 我表示遗憾
I'm... I'm very sorry.

514
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,270
Hume先生 你相信一见钟情吗?
Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?

515
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,990
你说什么?
Excuse me?

516
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,360
几周前 我路过这家博物馆的时候
The first time I saw her, I was walking through this museum

517
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,140
第一次见到了她
a few weeks ago.

518
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,430
她... 她就在这里工作 那时她正好午餐休息
She... she works here. She was on her lunch break.

519
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,780
她正在吃一个巧克力棒
She was eating a chocolate bar.

520
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,480
她拥有蓝宝石般的眼睛 红色的头发
She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair.

521
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,600
就在我看到她的时候
And as soon as I saw her,

522
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,110
就在... 在那个瞬间 就像...
right... right in that moment, it was like...

523
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,820
仿佛我已经爱上了她
it was like I already loved her.

524
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,900
事情也从那刻起 变得诡异了起来
And that's when things got weird.

525
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,920
在我见到那个女人的当晚...
That same night after I saw that woman...

526
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,300
我忽然醒来 并且写了这些
I woke up and I wrote this.

527
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,350
这是什么呢?
So what is it?

528
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,400
我也不知道 我仅仅是个搞音乐的
I'm a musician. I have no idea.

529
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,700
然后我把这个 给一个加州理工学院的朋友看
So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech.

530
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,610
他精通数学 他说这个是量子力学
He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics.

531
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,730
他说这些方程式非常超前
He said these equations are so advanced that

532
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,930
只有那些研究了一辈子物理的人
only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life

533
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,760
才可以想出来
could've come up with them.

534
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,480
所以...
So...

535
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,340
所以 那意味着什么?
so what do they mean?

536
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,360
好吧 想象一下... 假如一桩恐怖事件
Okay, imagine... imagine something terrible is about to happen,

537
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,710
一件惨事即将发生
something catastrophic.

538
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,080
唯一可以阻止这件事情发生
And the only way to stop it from happening

539
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,540
的办法是...
was by...

540
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,440
释放一股巨大的能量
releasing a huge amount of energy.

541
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,800
就比如引爆原子弹
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

542
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,170
你想要去引爆原子弹?
You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?

543
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:24,150
听着 如果这些... 所有这些...
Just listen. What if this... all this...

544
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,270
假如所有的这些 都不应该是我们的宿命呢?
what if this wasn't supposed to be our life?

545
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,300
假如... 我们本可以有别的生活
What if we... we had some other life

546
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,140
可是出于某些原因 生活的轨迹被更改了?
and for some reason, we changed things?

547
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,430
Hume先生 我不想去引爆原子弹
I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

548
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,900
可是 我想我已经这么做了
I think I already did.

549
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,350
听着 伙计...
Listen, mate, um...

550
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,460
我不知道这些事情与我有什么关系 所以...
I don't know what any of this has to do with me. So...

551
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,300
你为什么要问我妈妈 那个叫Penny的女孩子?
Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny?

552
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,220
你有过一见钟情 对不?
It happened to you, too, didn't it?

553
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,490
你有这种感觉
You felt it.

554
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,470
我不知道...
I don't know...

555
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,560
我自己也不清楚我的感受
I don't know what I felt.

556
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,430
是的 你感觉到了
Yes, you do.

557
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,380
你感受到了爱
You felt love.

558
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,010
那是不可能的
That's impossible because

559
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,860
因为我对这个女人一无所知
I don't know anything about this woman.

560
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,880
我不知道... 我不知道她身在何方
I don't know... I don't know where she is.

561
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,350
我甚至不知道 她是否活在这世上
I don't even know if she exists.

562
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,560
她是...
She's...

563
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,380
她只是我凭空想出来的
She's an idea.

564
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,700
你错了 Hume先生
No, Mr. Hume.

565
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,290
她是我的同父异母的姐妹
She's my half-sister.

566
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,970
我可以很清楚地告诉你 你可以在何时何地找到她
And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.

567
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,220
打扰一下?
Excuse me?

568
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,970
什么事?
Yeah?

569
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,660
你是Penny?
Are you Penny?

570
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,310
呃 是的
Uh, yes.

571
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,130
你好
Hello.

572
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,380
我叫Desmond
I'm Desmond.

573
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,480
呃 你好
Uh, hi.

574
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,360
赶紧检查下
Checking in now.

575
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,500
他没事
He's okay.

576
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,170
确实 他没事
Indeed he is.

577
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,790
Desmond 你好吗? 你感觉如何?
How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?

578
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,310
挺好的
Fine.

579
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,310
我... 我昏迷了多久?
H... how long was I unconscious for?

580
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,400
不过几秒钟而已
Oh, no more than a few seconds.

581
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,950
你可以把我拉起来吗?
Will you help me up, please?

582
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,070
Desmond 很抱歉我们对你做的这一切
I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond.

583
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,840
但是正如我所说的 你的... 天赋是我们任务成败的关键
But as I told you, your... talent is vital to our mission.

584
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,440
所以如果你需要我给你解释...
So if you just let me explain...

585
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,200
没关系 我可以理解
It's all right. I understand.

586
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,830
什么?
What?

587
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,310
我说我可以理解的
I said I understand.

588
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,830
你告诉过我 说你把我带到岛上
You told me you brought me here to the island

589
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,740
去完成一些非常重要的事情
to do something very important.

590
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,330
是的
Yeah.

591
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,410
我们什么时候开工?
When do we start?

592
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,690
你怎么了?
What happened to you?
