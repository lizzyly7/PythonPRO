《迷失》前情提要
Previously on "lost"...

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,017
不管Ben Linus在兰花站里做了什么
whatever ben linus did down at the orchid station,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,000
都可能把我们隔离了
It may have... dislodged us.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,036
这座岛穿越时空了吗
The island is moving through time?

5
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,028
可能是岛  也可能是我们
Yeah, either the island is, or we are.

你没事吧
Are you all right?

00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:28,055
-我刚在岛上  -你已经离开岛上三年了
I was on the island. you've been off the island for three years.

11
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:32,008
你现在安然无恙  只是个梦而已
You're safe now. it was just a dream.

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,068
Pen  我不是在做梦
It wasn't a dream, pen.

13
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:36,078
是段记忆
It was a memory.

对

知道该做什么吗
You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?

你做到了
You did it.

48
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:33,054
Penny  你做到了

我爱你  Penny  我爱你
I love you, penny. I love you.

51
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,063

52
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,020
天呐  他好帅啊
Oh, my god. he's so beautiful.

53
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:55,000
天呐
Oh, my god.

57
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,070
看
Look.

58
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:28,033
就在那边
Right out there.

59
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:33,000
在你看不见的地方  有一座岛
Beyond where you can see, there's--there's an island,

60
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,087
一座非常特别的岛
And it's a very special island.

61
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:40,043
我很久以前离开了那里
I left it a long time ago.

62
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,014
从没想过我会再见到它
I never thought I'd see it again.

63
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:46,037
它叫英国
It's called great britain.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,077
那座岛屿最美的地方是苏格兰
And the most beautiful part of the island is scotland,

65
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,077
那也是你爸爸的出身地
And that's where your daddy's from.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,007
那里有山脉  幽谷  还有深湖的水怪
There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs,

67
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,063
还有
And...

68
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:02,087
那也是你爸爸妈妈
And it's where your mommy and daddy...

69
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,040
想恋的地方
Fell in love.

70
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,074
也是她心碎的地方
It's also where he broke her heart.

71
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,070
我...
Yeah, well, i...

72
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,050
我以为你会忘记那段往事
I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it.

73
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:21,000
你也漏说了他的爷爷
You also left out the bit about his grandfather--

74
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:23,047
他派了艘船去岛上
The man who sent a boat to the island

75
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,047
去将爸爸的朋友赶尽杀绝
To kill all daddy's friends.

76
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,087
我们来去自由  他永远不会知道我们在这里
We'll be in and out. he'll never know we're here, penny.

77
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,010
别小看他  Desmond
Don't underestimate him, desmond.

78
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:36,014
如果他知道我们在这里  不知他会怎么做
If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do.

79
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:39,014
可这与你的父亲无关  Penny
But this has nothing to do with your father, penny.

80
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:42,033
我们是因为Daniel Faraday才来到这里
We are here because of daniel faraday.

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,070
他告诉我
What he told me--

82
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:49,090
岛上的每个人都身处险境
That everyone on that island is in danger,

83
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:54,020
我是唯一能帮他们的人
And I am the only one that can help them.

84
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:01,010
我不得不这么做  Penny
I have to do this, penny.

85
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,083
你确定他是这么说的吗
Are you sure that's what he said?

86
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,034
Sawyer说在那条小溪会合
Yeah, sawyer said to meet at the creek,

87
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,083
如果他被射死了
So unless he got torched by a flaming arrow,

88
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:14,087
那就是他要其他人去的地方
That's where he and everyone else should be.

89
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:19,017
你的头痛怎么样了
Hey, how's your headache?

90
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,070
更严重了
Worse, actually.

91
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:23,000
可考虑到我们在为生存而奔波
But considering we're running for our lives,

92
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,067
我不会发牢骚
I'm not gonna complain.

93
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,077
你有没有头昏眼花或看见重影
You have any dizziness or double vision?

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,097
都有
Both, actually.

95
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:37,084
为什么你那么担忧
Why do you look so worried?

96
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,072
你是不是知道我会出什么事
Is it because you know what's happening to me?

97
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:46,096
你不会有事的  
Listen to me. nothing is gonna happen to you. nothing.

98
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,013
有我在
I won't let it.

99
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,079
我们到了
Hey, we're here!

100
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,042
只有我们到了这里
Some rendezvous. it's just us.

101
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:01,076
我们该等等  
Well, we should probably wait, see if they show up.

102
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,073
没准他们就在后面
They could be right behind us.

103
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:06,076
-是呀  他们没准来过  -没准死了
- Yeah, or they came and left. or they're dead.

104
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,089
Miles  你的那种态度
Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude...

105
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:12,036
得改一改
Not exactly what we need right now.

106
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,066
大家已经够害怕了  Miles
People are scared enough as it is. miles--

107
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,029
Miles
Miles?

108
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,083
停下  别动
Wait! don't move! aah!

109
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:05,069
你们谁是头
Who's in charge here?

110
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:08,066
他
He is.

111
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,062
你非得来是吧
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

他吃完早饭了吗
Did he finish his breakfast?

121
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,002
吃完了
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:53,015
开始不听话  不过还是乖乖顺从了
Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end...

123
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,025
不像他爸爸
Unlike his father.

124
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,035
听着亲爱的
Look, honey,

125
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,012
我只要找到他妈妈

126

告诉她他还在岛上

127
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:08,015
-然后就彻底结束  -为何现在
- And then I'm done with this for good.  - why now?

128
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,015
如果他在岛上就告诉了你一切
I mean, if he told you all this on the island,

129
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,076
你怎么会两天前才想起
Why didn't you remember it until two days ago?

130
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:15,062
我不知道
I don't know.

131
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,062
这其中道理  我了解的
Look, I don't understand how any of this works

132
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,012
并不比你多
Any more than you do. it...

133

Daniel Faraday敲开了舱门

而我是唯一可以救他们的人

我知道这听起来很疯狂
I know how insane it sounds.

139
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,082
我会在天黑前回来
I'll be back by dark,

140
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,072
然后一切结束
And then I'm done...

永不再提
Forever.

如果你要保证什么  Des

能保证你再不回那岛了吗
Can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again?

145
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:13,012
我干嘛再回那岛
Why in god's name would I ever go back there?

146
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:30,089
海滩上你们还有20个人,但这只有5个人
There were 20 of you at the beach, But only five of you here.

147
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,096
其他人呢
Where are the rest of your people?

148
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:35,022
也许被你的其他陷阱炸死了
Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines.

149
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:38,046
那不是我们放的  是你放的
We didn't put them here. you did.

150
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,056

你就不归我管了

这些人是谁
Who are these people?

156
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:14,046
我还没空问,当时情况紧急
Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that, With frogurt on fire and all.

157
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,043
他们在海滩上袭击我们
They attacked us on the beach.

158
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:20,073
这是一支30口径格兰德步枪  很新
This is a 30-caliber m1 garand rifle. it looks new.

159
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,055
管什么步枪  你去哪里了
Who cares about the rifle? where the hell you been?

160
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,079
要是你有了我的经历  James
If you've been going through what I have, james,

161
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,001
也许就会更恰当的问
Maybe the more appropriate question would be,

162
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,097
我去什么时间了
When the hell have I been?

163
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:34,084
-你的腿怎么回事  -被射中了
- What happened to your leg?  - I got shot.

164
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:37,018
-谁干的  -过会儿再聊吧
- By who?  - we can swap stories later.

165
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,045
我们和其他人说好要在溪边见  
We told the rest of our group that we would meet them at the creek.

166
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:42,032
如果还想和他们联系上就得出发了
If there's any chance Of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving.

167
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,043
既然我们没有绳子绑住他们  
Fine, seeing as we have no rope

168
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:46,000
以防我们再被袭击
To make sure these two don't try to kill us again.

169
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:49,080
-我们只能打死他们  -[拉丁语]
- Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.  - quare non sunt vestitus eis?

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,053
-[拉丁语]  -什么
- Tace!  - what?

171
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,030
-那是什么语言  -他们在说拉丁语
- What kind of language is that?  - they're speaking latin.

172
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:04,010
一个问我们怎么没穿制服
That one asked why we aren't in uniform,

173
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,023
另一个叫他闭嘴
And this one told him to shut up.

174
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:10,073
他们怎么会懂拉丁语  Juliet
And how is it that they know how to speak latin, juliet?

175
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:14,030
和我一样
The same reason I do.

176
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,026
他们是"The Others"
Because they're others.

177
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,016
-听着  -什么
- Hey.  - yeah.

178
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,013
-我们刚走过一个新坟  -什么
- We just walked over a fresh grave.  - what?

179
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,053
四个美国大兵
Four u.s. soldiers,

180
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:54,093
刚死一个月
Dead just under a month.

00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:57,010
三个被打死
Three of them were shot.

182
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:59,096
一个辐射致死
One died of radiation poisoning.

183
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,043
Miles  听着
Miles, hey, hey.

184
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,047
有没有哪个提到这是几几年
Did any of them happen to mention what year it is?

185
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,033
我们到了
We're here.

186
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,037
Richard  我们回来了
Richard? we're back.

187
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:41,070
在溪边抓住三个
Caught the three by the creek.

188
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,076
这个是他们的头
This one's their leader.

189
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,010
你叫什么
What's your name?

190
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,053
你叫什么
What's your name?

191
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:57,017
我叫Richard Alpert
My name is Richard Alpert.

192
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:02,060
我想你是回来找炸弹的
I assume you've come back for your bomb.

193
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:20,072
抱歉,先生,我没找到Faraday的记录
No, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not find a record of any faraday.

194
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,028
这不可能
No, that--that's impossible.

195
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:25,017
我知道她儿子在这做教授
'cause I know her son was a professor here.

196
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,027
他叫Daniel Faraday  他肯定有记录
His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database.

197
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:30,057
先生,没有任何关于Faraday被牛津雇佣的记录
Sir, there's no record of any Faraday Ever having been employed here at oxford.

198
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:33,030
我去看过他
I visited him.

199
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:36,043
我去了他的实验室  在阁楼里
I went to his lab. it was in an attic.

200
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:39,016
在物理系楼上
It was...  it was above the physics department.

201
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,072
档案记录很久了,可能是写错了
The archives go back quite far. Perhaps there was a clerical error.

202
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,011
能回忆一下,你最后一次拜访是哪一年吗
You don't happen to recall the year In which you last visited?

203
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,095
哪一年
The year?

204
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:51,041
不  我
No. I'm...

205
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:53,011
我不确定
I'm not exactly sure.

206
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:57,041
能问下你为什么查这条信息吗
May I ask why you're seeking this information?

207
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,078
抱歉  麻烦你了
Sorry I wasted your time.

208
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,022
别碰它
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.

209
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:00,068
就知道有人会知道...
I wondered when someone'd figure out

210
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:03,032
我们不是在消毒
Were weren't just fumigating here.

211
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:07,051
你是教授
You a professor?

212
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:10,032
不算是
No. not exactly.

213
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:16,018
至少你还诚实
At least you're honest.

214
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,052
为什么让我不要碰它
So why'd you tell me not to touch it?

215
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:21,042
我是来把这些恶心的老鼠
Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made

216
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,019
扔进焚尸炉的人
Run through this bloody thing down to the incinerator

217
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:26,089
-这样就没人知道他都做了什么  -你是说Daniel Faraday
So that no one would find out what he was up to. you mean daniel faraday.

218
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,053
是啊,你不是唯一打听..他和他的工作的人
Yeah. you're not the first one to poke around here, asking about him and his work.

219
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:35,086
传言说他曾经试图让老鼠穿越时空
Rumor had it, he was trying to send rats' brains back in time.

220
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:37,096
真可笑  对吗
Ridiculous, innit?

221
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,096
是啊
Aye.

222
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:44,043
只要你和别人讲...
Look, I'll forget you broke my lock

223
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,089
这些都是一个疯子留下的垃圾
If you tell your mates that all you found

224
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:51,016
我就不计较你闯进来了
Was rubbish left behind by a madman.

225
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,043
好的
Fair enough.

226
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,086
Faraday
Faraday--

227
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,078
学校说没有关于他的记录
The university says there's no record of him.

228
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,075
你能责备他们吗
Well, can you blame 'em?

229
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,048
在他对那可怜姑娘做了那些事以后
I mean, after what he'd done to that poor girl?

230
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,072
什么女孩
What girl?

231
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,082
小心
Hey, take it easy.

232
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:32,038
Dan  我没事
It's all right, dan. I'm fine.

233
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:34,035
我们会死的
We are so dead.

234
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:36,032
不
Hey. no, no, no.

235
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,085
我们会没事的
We are not so dead. we're gonna be fine.

236
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,078
直到下一次闪光  我们要在一起
We just need to keep it together until there's another flash.

237
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,078
然后这些就都消失了
All right? then all this disappears.

238
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:46,092
-什么时候  -可能五分钟后
And when's that gonna happen? could be five minutes.

239
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,022
也可能5000年后
Could also be 5,000 years.

240
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,019
太好了
That's--that's just awesome.

241
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:53,015
怎么回事  Dan
What is going on, dan?

242
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:56,022
-为什么他们这样对我们  -我不知道
Why are they doing this to us? I'm not sure.

243
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:59,009
他们肯定认为我们是美军的人
But they must think that we're with the american military.

244
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,038
如果是这样  我们活着的唯一机会
And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive

245
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:05,072
就是让他们一直这样想  让...
Is to let them keep thinking it, all right? let--

246
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,062
对不起  打搅你们了吗
Sorry. am I interrupting?

247
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:15,082
Ellie告诉我你们不愿意说出其他人在哪
Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal Where the rest your squad is.

248
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:19,026
我为什么说  这样你们会也杀了他们
And why would I do that? so you can kill them, too?

249
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:22,012
我们没这样做  朋友  你们的人袭击了我们
We didn't start this, friend. your people attacked us.

250
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:26,019
你们来我们的小岛做试验
You come to our island to run your tests,

251
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:28,012
向我们开枪
You fire on us, and what,

252
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,032
还想我们不要保卫自己的家园
You expect us notto defend ourselves?

253
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,075
我不知道这些事  我们是科学家
I don't know anything about that. we are scientists.

254
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:39,022
那又怎么样  他们派你们来找回它吗
So what? so they sent you here to recover it?

255
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:42,019
你说的是说氢弹吧
If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes.

256
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:45,022
从他的辐射伤势我猜
And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns

257
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,019
这间房子已经遭到了辐射
That the housing has been compromised.

258
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:48,068
对吗
Is that right?

259
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:52,005
听我说
You need to listen to me.

260
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,002
这个装置极不稳定
You have an unstable device

261
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,005
有可能会毁了整个小岛
That's capable of destroying this entire island,

262
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,075
它发生了故障
And it's broken.

263
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,072
如果你不让我使它停下来
If you don't allow me to render it inert,

264
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,085
我们都会死
All of us are gonna die.

265
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:06,052
所有人  我怎么知道你不是来执行自杀任务的
All of us. how do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission?

266
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,098
我带你去炸弹那里
That I'll take you out to the bomb,

267
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,059
然后你把它引爆
And you'll just detonate it?

268
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:17,085
因为...
Because...

269
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:21,008
因为我爱坐在我旁边的这个女人
I'm in love with the woman sitting next to me.

270
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:30,052
我永远不会...
And I would never...

271
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,098
我永远也不会做伤害她的事
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

272
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,055
好吧
All right.

273
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,081
修好你的炸弹
Take care of your bomb.

274
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,078
不过如果你想做什么事   都会伤害到她
But you try anything else, and you will hurt her.

275
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,061
谁教的你拉丁语
So who taught you latin?

276
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,055
我们必修的
Others 101.

277
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:05,031
启蒙的语言嘛
Gotta learn latin-- language of the enlightened.

278
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:07,068
去你的启蒙
Enlightened, my ass.

279
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:10,074
我建议你跟我们谈谈
I suggest you talk to us.

280
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,078
要是等我们回到小溪
Once we get back to the creek

281
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,078
跟其他人汇合
And meet up with the rest of our people,

282
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:17,011
会有很多人对你弄气冲冲
There's gonna be a lot of anger directed at you

283
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,025
剩下的人有的被抓了
For attacking them. the rest of your people

284
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:21,028
-有的死了  -什么
Are either captured or dead. what?

285
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,088
为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

286
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,098
那个白痴大喊"小溪那见"
That idiot shouted out, "meet at the creek."

287
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:35,011
我们知道他们要去哪
We knew exactly where they were headed.

288
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,011
派人跟着他们
Sent a group after them.

289
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,088
或许我可以用我的暗语说  James  等等
Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language. james, wait.

290
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:43,008
我们不是你们的敌人
We're not your enemy

291
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,089
那就放了我们
then let us go

292
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:49,004
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you sayin'?

293
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,028
带我们去你们的营地
take us to your camp

294
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:55,032
带我们去

295
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:56,086
我为什么带你们去
why would i do that

296
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,031
是不是

297
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,040
Richard在那
...Richard there?

298
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,002
Richard Alpert
Richard Alpert?

299
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:05,018
你刚才说"Richard Alpert"
Did you just say "richard alpert"?

300
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,004
John  拜托
John, please.

301
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,036
带我们去你们的营地

302

带我们去
please

304
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,025
好吧
All right.

305
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:35,061
向东走两公里
Okay, we need to head east another couple of kilometers

306
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,011
直到那座山...
Unl we hit the ridge--

307
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,025
开枪
Shoot him!

308
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:47,018
开枪  该死的
Shoot, damn it!

309
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,094
你疯了吗  想什么呢
Are you crazy?! what were you thinking?

310
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:55,001
你怎么不向他开枪
Why didn't you shoot him?!

311
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,074
因为
Because...

312
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:01,068
他是我的人
He's one of my people.

313
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,054
你是谁
And who might you be?

314
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:37,013
我叫Desmond Hume  我找Theresa Spencer
Uh, my name's desmond hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.

315
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:39,020
我是Abigail Spencer  Theresa的姐姐
I'm Abigail Spencer. Theresa's my sister.

316
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,090
我可以和她谈一下吗
Oh, right. um, can I have a word with her?

317
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,088
你要和Theresa谈话
You wanna speak to Theresa?

318
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,084
我在牛津大学碰到一位先生
Yeah, I got her name

319
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,084
是从他那里得到她的名字
From a-a gentleman I met at oxford university--

320
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,081
那位先生叫Daniel Faraday
Um... Daniel Faraday.

321
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,078
Daniel Faraday
Daniel Faraday?

322
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:54,045
你怎么不早说
Well, why didn't you say so?

323
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:57,076
请吧  请进
Please, you must come in.

324
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,011
谢谢
Thanks.

325
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:23,051
他没告诉你  是吗
He didn't tell you, did he?

326
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:27,004
没有  他没告诉我
No. no, he didn't.

327
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,021
她能听见我们说话吗
Can she hear us?

328
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,035
不能  Theresa现在离开了
No. Theresa's away right now.

329
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:33,094
"离开"  什么意思
"away"? what do you mean?

330
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,091
有时她醒来  认为自己只有三岁
Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3,

331
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:38,018
想要知道她的洋娃娃在哪儿
Wants to know where her dolly is.

332
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,038
昨天  她和我们的爸爸说话
Yesterday, she was talking to our dad.

333
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,098
而他五年前就死了
He died five years ago.

334
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,094
我很难过
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:47,094
肯定是搞错了  我不应该来的
Um, this was a mistake. i... I shouldn't have come.

336
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,021
当然
Of course.

337
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:53,001
你怎么会想留下来
Why would you want to stay?

338
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,008
Daniel一定不会
Daniel certainly didn't.

339
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,071
他就这样弃她于不顾
He left her like this?

340
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:02,091
逃到美国去  再也没有音信
Went running off to the states, never to be heard from again.

341
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:05,035
他抛弃了她
He abandoned her.

342
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,028
哪种人会这么干
What kind of a man does that?

343
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,091
如果不是Widmore先生
I seriously don't know what we would've done

344
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:15,014
我真的不知道他做了什么
If it hadn't been for mr. widmore.

345
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,001
对不起  谁
Uh, I'm sorry. who?

346
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,018
Daniel的资助人
Daniel's benefactor.

347
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:20,084
他资助他的研究
He funded his research,

348
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:23,088
而他为此结果负责
And he took responsibility for the result of it.

349
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:27,021
自从Theresa开始这样起  他就照顾她
He's been taking care of Theresa ever since this happened to her.

350
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:31,088
这儿的一切都多亏Widmore先生
Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore,

351
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:33,055
上帝保佑他
God bless him.

352
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,003
氢弹
A hydrogen bomb?

353
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:41,083
真的吗
Seriously?

354
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:43,080
回溯到50年代
Back in the '50s,

355
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:47,027
美国政府在南太平洋试验氢弹
The U.S. government tested h-bombs in the south pacific.

356
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:52,067
我们真走运
Lucky us.

357
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,073
你不必那么说
You didn't have to say that.

358
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:01,003
说什么
Say what?

359
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:03,053
说你爱我
That you loved me.

360
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:05,087
有很多其他的借口
I mean, there are plenty of other ways

361
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,087
你可以用来说服他
You could've convinced him

362
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,016
你不会把整个岛都炸掉
You weren't gonna blow up the entire island.

363
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,033
我这么说
I said what I said

364
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:18,033
因为我就是这个意思  Charlotte
Because I meant it, Charlotte.

365
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,047
行了
Right, then.

366
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,020
我们走
Let's go.

367
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:34,033
我保证  很快回来
Back soon. I promise.

368
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:57,023
不管你的上级跟你说了什么
Whatever your, uh, your superiors told you,

369
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,067
我想要你知道真相
I want you to know the truth.

370
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,030
一个月以前  我们发现了一个营的18名成员
A month ago, we found 18 members of an army battalion

371
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:06,053
就在我们的丛林  架起了这座帐篷
Right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp.

372
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:09,050
我们给了他们离开此岛的机会
We gave them the opportunity to leave the island peacefully.

373
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:12,050
他们不愿意那么做  所以我被迫杀了他们
They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill 'em.

374
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:15,033
全部
All of 'em.

375
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,080
-被迫  -是的
- Forced? - Yeah.

376
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,050
谁下的命令
By whom?

377
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,047
你对某人负责  不是吗
Y-you answer to someone, don't you?

378
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,010
遵循一系列的命令  对吧
You follow a chain of command, right?

379
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,006
-是的  -我也是
- Yeah. - yeah, well, so do i.

380
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,087
Richard  Richard
Richard! Richard!

381
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,010
你到底怎么了
What the hell happened to you?

382
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,067
Cunningham和我  他们突袭了我们
Cunningham and i-- a group of them surprised us.

383
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,013
我们寡不敌众  但是我逃掉了
We were outnumbered, but I escaped.

384
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:42,023
-寡不敌众  -闭嘴  Ellie
- Outnumbered, eh? - Shut up, Ellie.

385
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:45,013
-他是谁  -他会帮我们解决问题
- Who's this? - He's gonna help us take care of our problem.

386
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,080
-你最好开始行动  -他是他们中的一员
- You'd better get going. - Wait. he's one of them.

387
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,090
你不能信任他
You can't actually trust him.

388
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,053
行了  你听到我说的了  Ellie  去吧
Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. go.

389
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,060
-你是怎么逃脱的  -跑啊
- H-how did you escape? - I ran.

390
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:55,010
你没想过他们会跟踪你吗
And it never occurred to you that they might follow you?

391
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,057
跟踪我  他们的头儿是个下贱的老头
Follow me? Their leader is some sodding old man.

392
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,073
你认为他能追踪到我
What, you think he can track me?

393
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:02,073
你认为他比我更了解这个岛
You think he knows this island better than I do?

394
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:14,063
你怎么知道Richard会到这里来
How did you know Richard would be here?

395
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:17,026
Richard一直在这儿
Richard's always been here.

396
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,077
他多大
How old is he?

397
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,033
一把年纪了
Old.

398
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:25,096
John  你为什么对Richard那么感兴趣
Why are you so interested in Richard, John?

399
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,060
我对他感兴趣
I'm interested in him

400
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,090
是因为他可能告诉我该怎么拯救我们
Because he was about to tell me how I could save us.

401
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,006
拯救我们
"save us"?

402
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,040
是的
Yeah.

403
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:35,036
但是在他说完之前
But before he could finish,

404
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,060
我们就被闪光打断了
We were interrupted by that flash of light.

405
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:43,026
-我希望还能继续下去  -我不想打断
- And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off. - I hate to bust up

406
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,050
你们自己人的重聚
The "i'm an other, you're an other" reunion,

407
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,053
Faraday  那个确实能拯救我们的家伙
But Faraday--the guy that's actually gonna save us--

408
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:49,020
快被拖进丛林被枪毙了
Is being death marched into the jungle right now.

409
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,087
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

410
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,043
你不准备帮我救他吗
You're not gonna help me save him?

411
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,050
不  我准备过去
No.I'm gonna go down

00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:59,080
那会害死我们的
That's gonna get us all killed.

00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,080
你过去后他们就知道我们在这了
You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here.

415
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:05,033
我会先给你10分钟跑路的
Fair enough. I'll give you ten minutes head start.

416
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:12,013
那你呢
What about you?

417
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,000
你想留在这个疯城里
You wanna stay here in crazytown

418
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:17,020
还是帮我救那个书呆子
Or help me rescue the geek?

419
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:19,020
你为什么一直看着我
Why do you keep looking at me?

420
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,016
不  我不是  我
No, no, I'm--i'm not. i--

你知道吗  你是对的  对不起
You know what? you're right. I'm--i'm sorry.

423
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,030
只是
It's just...

424
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:32,033
你看起来很像
You look so much like...

425
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,033
我认识的一个人
Someone I used to know.

426
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,095
不是那个
Someone other than the girl

427
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:37,053
你疯狂地爱着的女孩吧

-难道你是罗密欧吗  -不是的  相信我
- Well, aren't you the romeo.  - far from it, believe me.

429
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,063
我不信你 
I don't believe you, by the way.

430
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:48,023
你也许蒙过Richard了
You may have richard fooled,

431
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,073
但是你别指望我会信你
You can't really expect me to believe

你们在岛上干什么
And what are you doing on our island?

你想知道我是谁
You wanna know who I am?

这不安全  我们得离开
It's unsafe. we need to move.

If I try anything--

00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,033
你就会  你就会打死我
What, you're gonna-- you're gonna shoot me?

449
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:44,000
是吗
Is that right?

450
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:46,007
好了  这好极了  因为  毫无疑问
Yeah, that would be perfect because, of course,

来复枪的火力正在  你管这个叫什么
Rifle fire right next to-- what would you call this--

氢弹的附近  是的  真是异想天开

真的会引爆氢弹

好了  听我说
Okay, listen to me.

-你的人有办法找到铅或混凝土吗  -干什么
- Do you people have any access to lead or concrete? - for what?

456
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:04,059
外箱上有一道裂痕  需要铅来填补
There's a crack in the casing. it needs to be filled with lead.

457
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:07,060
需要很小心地把它从平台上拿下来
You need to take it off this platform carefully

458
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:10,053
-埋了它  -你绕了这么大一个圈子
- And bury it. - You brought me all the way out here

459
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:11,032
就是为了告诉我们得埋了它
To tell us that we have to bury it?

460
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,082
你告诉Alpert你可以拆除那东西  
You told Alpert you could disarm that thing.

461
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:17,024
无需担心,照我说的做,埋了它,它不会爆炸的
You don't need to worry. You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off.

462
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:20,028
-你怎么知道  -你得相信我
- How do you know that? - I need you to trust me.

463
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,060
我不相信你
I don't trust you.

464
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,038
只要埋了它  就什么事都没有
just bury it. bury it, and everything will be fine.

465
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:26,053
你的长官命令我来处理这件事
Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this.

466
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,051
你怎么能这么确定
How can you be so sure?

467
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,083
你要处理这个炸弹吗  那就埋了它
You wanna take care of this bomb? you bury it!

468
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,078
你怎么知道不会有事
How?! how do you know that?

469
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:33,024
因为50年后  这个岛还存在
Because 50 years from now, this island is still here!

470
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,031
你
There you...

471
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:39,021
你说的是什么
What did you just say?

472
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,061
别紧张
Whoa. take it easy.

473
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,058
我可以解释得更清楚些
I can explain myself a little better.

474
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,054
我知道这听起来怪异
I know how this sounds.

475
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:48,014
相信我  这很难解释
Believe me, it's... oh, it's hard to explain.

476
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:49,078
50年后
50 years from now,

477
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,024
我和我的
Me and my..

478
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:53,031
我和我的朋友
Me and my friends--

479
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,051
我们就是从那里来的
That's where we're from, okay?

480
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:58,081
关键在这儿  一切都安好
And here's the key-- everything's fine.

481
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,031
我不是说非常完美
I'm not saying it's perfectly fine,

482
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:05,031
但是没有原子弹爆炸
But there hasn't been any atomic blasts, all right?

483
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:07,058
把枪发下  金发女郎
There has not-- drop the gun, blondie.

484
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:11,061
没事
It's okay.

485
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,005
你可以把枪发下
She's okay. you can put your gun down.

486
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:15,071
她先放下
She puts hers down first.

487
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,088
为什么我们不都放下抢
Why don't we all put our guns down?

488
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:26,044
我说  放下枪
I said, drop it!

489
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:38,034
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

490
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:42,078
他们也来自未来吗
Are they from the future, too?

491
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,085
你告诉她了
You told her?

492
00:32:53,044 --> 00:32:55,054
先生  你不能
Sir! sir, you can't--

493
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,098
Widwore先生
Mr. widmore.

494
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,068
对不起  他没经过我就进来了
I'm so sorry. he charged right past me.

495
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,031
没事  Melanie
That's all right, melanie.

496
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:10,018
Hume先生是...我的是一个同事
Mr. hume is a... colleague of mine.

497
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:17,031
让我们单独谈谈
Please leave us.

498
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:30,031
我知道你有问题问我
I know you have questions for me.

499
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:32,031
我不会回答的
I'm not gonna answer them.

500
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,078
我来这是想问你点事
I've come here to ask you something.

501
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:37,075
只要你告诉我想知道的
And once you've told me everything I need to know,

502
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:40,034
我永远都不再来找你
You'll never see me again.

503
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:42,085
明白吗
Understand?

504
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,048
好的
All right.

505
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:50,001
我想知道Daniel Faraday的母亲在哪
I need to know where I can find daniel faraday's mother.

506
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:55,054
你怎么知道我能回答你
What makes you think I would even know the answer to that?

507
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:58,051
因为在你把Faraday放到那船上
Because even before you put faraday on your little boat

508
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,048
送到小岛上之前
And sent him off to the island,

509
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:03,078
你已经资助他的研究十年之久
You spent ten years funding his research.

510
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:07,068
所有我想你肯定知道点什么
So I figure, you must know something

511
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:10,058
关于他的近亲
Regarding his next of kin.

512
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:13,061
Desmond
Desmond

513
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:17,018
我有三年没有任何关于我女儿的消息了
I haven't seen or heard from my daughter for three years.

514
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,088
只要回答我
Just answer me this.

515
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,008
她安全吗
Is she safe?

516
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,068
Faradey的妈妈在哪
Where's faraday's mother?

517
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:40,091
她在洛杉矶
She's in los angeles.

518
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:46,001
这是她的地址
This is an address for her.

519
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:51,088
她不会很乐意见你的
I suspect she won't be pleased to see you.

520
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,021
她比较喜欢独处
She's a very private person.

521
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:10,038
等等  Desmond
Wait, desmond.

522
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,018
把你的信息传到...
Deliver your message...

523
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,088
然后就不要管这个烂摊子了
But then get out of this mess.

524
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:25,025
不要让Penny有危险
Don't put penny's life in danger.

525
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:27,018
危险
Danger?

526
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,015
很多很多年以前
You're getting yourself involved in something

527
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:31,015
你就让自己介入了某件事
That goes back many, many years.

528
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:34,011
但是这都与你和我女儿无关
It has nothing to do with you or my daughter.

529
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,035
不管你们俩躲在哪
Wherever you were hiding...

530
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:38,031
回去吧
Go back there.

531
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,008
谢谢你的建议
Thanks for the advice.

Richard Alpert

533
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:01,055
-我在找Richard  -别动

534
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,065
-Richard Alpert  -跪下  快

536
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,011
闭上你的嘴
Shut your mouth!

537
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:09,015
够了
That's enough!

538
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:20,048
你是谁
Who are you?

539
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,068
我的名字是John Locke
My name is john locke.

540
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:30,028

Jacob派我来的
Jacob sent me.

542
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:49,058

什么
What?

544
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,098
Richard  你不会真的信他吧
Richard, you can't seriously trust him.

545
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,055
我说了...把枪放下  Widmore
I said... put the gun down, widmore.

546
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:07,041
你叫	Widmore
Your name is widmore?

547
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:09,091
Charles Widmore
Charles widmore?

548
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:12,038
关你什么事

没什么  很高兴见到你

我们没成功
We were unsuccessful.

556
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,042
你呢
And you?

557
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:58,049
你找到Faradey的母亲了吗
Did you find faraday's mum?

558
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:00,025
不用找了
there was no one to find.

559
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,095
她几年前就去世了
She, um...She died a few years ago.

560
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,089
你为什么骗我
Why are you lying to me?

561
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,039

她在洛杉矶
She's in los angeles.

564
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:33,045
Pen  你没什么好担心的
Look, pen, you've got nothing to worry about.

565
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:36,015
你知道  这都是一个错误
You know, this was a mistake.

566
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,022
不  我承诺这些一天之内都能办好的
No, i... I made a promise that this would be done in a day

567
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,072
现在办好了  这已经不是我们的问题了
And now it's done. it's not our problem anymore.

568
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:45,065
要是你明天醒来
And what happens if you wake up tomorrow

569
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:46,082
-又记起别的什么了呢  -那我就忘掉

-还有后天呢  -我会忘掉的

571
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,099
这都不重要  Pen
It doesn't matter, pen.

572
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:53,092
你们才是我的生活全部  你和Charlie

573
00:38:58,022 --> 00:39:00,019
我不会再丢下你的

574
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,019
不会因为这个

575
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:07,055
不会为了任何事
Not for anything.

576
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,015
你永远都忘不了的  Des
You'll never forget it, des.

577
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,099
所以我想我们得跟你一起去
So I guess we're going with you.

578
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,092
我给你这个的吗
I gave you this?

579
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,042
是的
Yes.

580
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:53,039
在你腿上中枪之后
After you were shot in the leg

581
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,089
然后我...从丛林里走出来帮你处理伤口
And i... wandered out of the jungle to patch you up?

582
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,035
是的
That's right.

583
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,019
那我为什么什么都不记得...任何细节
Then why don't I remember... well, any of this?

584
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,085
因为这些都还未发生呢
Because it hasn't happened yet.

585
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:07,055
我不知道你希望我说什么  John Locke
I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say, john locke.

586
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:10,021
我期望你告诉我怎么离开这个岛
I expect you to tell me how to get off the island.

587
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,019
那是高度机密
That's very privileged information.

588
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:13,072
我为什么要告诉你
Why would I share it with you?

589
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,004
因为你告诉我
Because you told me that

590
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,036
一旦我到了这里
I had something very impornt to do

591
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,049
有很重要的事需要我完成
Once I get there.

592
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,086
还有因为我是你的头儿
And because I'm your leader.

593
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:25,079
-你是我的头儿  -你是这么告诉我的
- You're my leader?  - that's what you told me.

594
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:28,026
我不想自我矛盾
Look, i... certainly don't want to contradict myself,

595
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,099
但是...关于选择头儿
But... we have a very specific process

596
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:33,062
我们有个具体程序要走
For selecting our leadership,

597
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,096
而且这在很小的年纪就要开始了
And it starts at a very, very young age.

598
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,056
好吧  好吧
All right. all right.

599
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,086

1954年
It's 1954.

That's the day I'm born--

加州的塔斯廷   如果你不信我

604
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:58,069

I suggest you come and visit me.

605
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:01,066
不
Oh, no.

606
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:05,096
-怎么了  -又要发生了
- What's wrong?  - it's about to happen again.

607
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,029
你现在就得告诉我  Richard
You need to tell me now, richard.

608
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,079
我要怎么离开这个岛  拜托  告诉我
