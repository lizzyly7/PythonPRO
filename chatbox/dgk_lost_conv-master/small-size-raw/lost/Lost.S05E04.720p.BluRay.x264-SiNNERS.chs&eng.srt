《迷失》前情提要...
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,099
你怎么会认识我父亲
How did you know my father?

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,012
他过来看他女儿

我女儿也在那架飞机上

她叫Claire

我们过来各取一份

你要去哪  妈妈

我们去度假  宝贝

13
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,025
-你怎么样  -扶我上车

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,022
-Sayid  你被袭击了  -Hurley在哪

15
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,078
John  拯救这座岛的唯一方法
The only way to save the island, John,

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,049
就是让你的人回来
Is to get your people back here.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,043
我应该怎么做
How? How am I supposed to do that?

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,033
-怎么了  -你...
- What? - You've...

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,063
你知道我这是怎么了吗
Do you know what's happening to me?

20
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:12,030
Charlotte  Charlotte
Charlotte? Charlotte?

21
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:35,075
不用这么蹑手蹑脚的
Oh, you don't have to whisper.

22
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,086
他睡着了就没关系了
When he's out, he's out.

23
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,005
总算有个人能睡得着了
At least one of us can sleep.

24
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:44,090
我至少得花上两个晚上
It's gonna take more than two nights

25
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:49,003
才能习惯在普通的床上睡觉
For me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed.

26
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,069
我们该拿他怎么办
What are we gonna do about him?

27
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:55,009
我是说Aaron
About Aaron.

28
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,055
我不知道
I don't know.

29
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:59,053
我反复考虑过关于他的问题
I've been thinking a lot about him.

30
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,089
你知道Clair曾经去过洛杉矶
Did you know that Claire was flying to l.a.

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,066
-打算让别人收养他吗  -我不知道
- To give him up for adoption? - No. No, I didn't.

32
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,075
我觉得应该对外宣称他是我儿子
I think we should say he's mine.

33
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:30,019
-什么  -我们可以说我在被捕的时候
- What? - We could say that I was six months pregnant

34
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,059
已经有六个月身孕
When I was arrested

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,082
然后我在岛上生下了他
And that I gave birth to him on the island.

36
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:37,079
- 没人会知道的  -Kate  不   你不必...
- No one would ever know.- Kate, no. You don't have to...

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,079
一定还有其它的办法
There's other ways to do this.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,032
我们已经失去了他们  Michael  Jin Sawyer...
After everyone we've lost-- Michael, Jin, Sawyer...

39
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,010
我不能再失去他
I can't lose him, too.

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,032
Sawyer并没有死
Sawyer's not dead.

41
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,062
是
No.

42
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:54,080
但他已经远去了
But he's gone.

43
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,046
晚安  Jack
Good night, Jack.

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,090
Kate
Kate...

45
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,045
如果我们想安全获救
If we're gonna be safe,

46
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:13,039
如果我们想保护留在岛上的其他人
If we're gonna protect the people that we left behind,

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,044
明天一早  我就要去
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to

48
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:17,002
说服大家编造谎言
Convince everyone to lie.

49
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,095
但凭我一己之力  是无法说服他们的
If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it.

50
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:23,025
所以我首先要说服你
So I'm gonna turn to you first.

51
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,010
你支持我吗
Are you with me?

52
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:39,066
我一直都是支持你的
I have always been with you.

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,030
三年后
Three Years Later

54
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,079
合身吗
How does it fit?

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,084
很合身  谢谢你借我穿
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.

56

00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,045
-你确定要这么做吗  -这可是你的主意
- Are you sure you want to do this? - It was your idea.

58
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,085
妈妈
Mommy!

59
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:13,062
Aaron宝贝  妈妈要出去办点事
Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand.

60
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:17,015
我很快就回来  然后我们就回家
I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.

61
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,058
别担心我们  Kate
Don't worry about us, Kate.

62
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:22,042
冰箱里有糖果  还有许多电视节目
There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on tv.

63
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,092
我们在这里会很好的
We're going to be just fine here.

64
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,069
Sun
Sun...

65
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,022
真不知道没有你我该怎么办
I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here.

66
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:31,072
谢谢你
Thank you.

67
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:34,040
这是朋友该做的
It's what any friend would do.

68
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:38,029
好了  我很快就回来
Okay, well, I will be back soon.

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,029
你和Sun好好相处

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,033

Charlotte  Charlotte
Charlotte? Charlotte?

84
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,040
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's wrong with her?

85
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,075
她已经昏过去十分钟了
She's been out for ten minutes.

86
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:26,091
别嚷嚷了  James
Stop shouting, James.

87
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,025
给你
Hey, man.

88
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:33,060
谢谢
Thank you.

89
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,060
如果你知道什么情况  Daniel
If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel,

90
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,030
最好现在就说
Now would be a good time.

91
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,075
我不太明白你的意思
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

92
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,020
她问你是否知道你女朋友昏迷的原因
She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.

93
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:44,070
让我们单独谈谈  好吗
Give us some space, would you?

94
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,020
她之所以会这样  都是因为闪光不断出现
She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up.

95
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,015
他明知道会这样
He knew this would happen

96
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:50,026
-却连个屁都不放...-James
- And he didn't say squat about it. - James...

97
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:51,071
走开
Go away.

98
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:04,001
你知道会发生这种情况吗
Did you know that this would happen?

99
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,003
我认为...
I thought...

100
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,004
我认为有可能
I thought it might.

101
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,033
我觉得这是神经学现象
I think it's neurological.

102
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,033
人的大脑有一个内部生物钟
Our brains have an internal clock,

103
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,015
对时间的意识
A sense of time.

104
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:19,050
这些闪光...扰乱了生物钟
The flashes... throw the clock off.

105
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:24,011
就像时差混乱
It's like really bad jet lag.

106
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:29,051
但时差混乱不会致人出血  Daniel
Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel.

107
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:34,075
你知道为什么我们其它人没有这种情况吗
You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?

108
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,027
不知道
I don't know.

109
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:42,031
幸好没有
But thank god it's not.

110
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,006
谢谢你的耐心等候
Thank you for waiting.

111
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,009
我的助理好好招待你了吗
Did my assistant offer you something to drink?

112
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,033
是的  很好  谢谢
Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.

113
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:59,051
很好  Austen小姐  请坐
Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit.

114
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,020
那么
So...

115
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,054
有什么问题
How can I help you?

116
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,076
Norton先生
Mr. Norton,

117
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:11,016
当你到我家来取我和我儿子
When you came to my house looking for blood samples

118
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,050
血液样本时
From me and my son,

119
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:16,070
我问你的客户是谁
I asked you who your client was...

120
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,070
我说无法透露
And I said I couldn't tell you.

121
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:21,091
对  我想和你作个交易
Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal.

122
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,020
我把血液样本给你
I'll give you the blood samples,

123
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:28,040
但是  我想先和你的客户谈谈
But first, I wanna talk to your client.

124
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,070
考虑到你的要求
Considering what you're asking for,

125
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,060
这样的做法更合理
That's more than reasonable.

126
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,070
好吧  我一会要和客户见面
Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today,

127
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,016
我一定把你的要求转述给他
And I will be sure to pass along your offer.

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:43,030
但是我很确定答案将会是
But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be--

129
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,063
不行
No.

130
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,053
至于原因  当然是
And the reason, of course,

131
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:49,020
你没有任何资格来谈条件
Is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals,

132
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,076
而我们都清楚
And we both know it.

133
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:52,080
我这里有一份已经签署的法庭命令可以强制你
I have a signed court order compelling you

134
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,016
允许我们核实你是否是孩子的母亲
To let us confirm that you're the child's mother.

135
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:58,016
我完全可以今天就派地方司法官去执行
I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it,

136
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,066
但是我的客户坚持要求我们
But my client insists that we...

137
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:04,040
私下转移监护权
Handle the exchange of custody quietly.

138
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,050
你说的"转移监护权"是什么意思
What do you mean "exchange of custody"?

139
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,040
你完全明白我是什么意思
You know exactly what I mean.

140
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,073
不  我
No, I...

141
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,086
Norton先生
Mr. Norton,

142
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:18,026
我只是想知道谁会这样对我
I just wanna know who is doing this to me.

143
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:21,023
你自食其果
You did this to yourself.

144
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:24,097
现在是时候做准备了  Austen小姐
Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen.

145
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,037
你将会失去这个男孩
You are going to lose the boy.

146
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:48,026
我们必须回到兰花站那里去
We have to go back to the Orchid.

147
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:49,073
什么
Excuse me?

148
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,033
兰花站
The Orchid.

149
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:55,041
那是一切开始的地方  也许会是终结的地方
That's where all this started. maybe it's where it'll all stop.

150
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:59,066
温室离这里很远
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

151
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,033
你说过你在后面的海滩有艘zodiac的救生艇
You said you had a zodiac raft back at the beach.

152
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,083
我们可以坐那艇  从小岛的角落抄近路过去
We could take that, cut around the horn of the island,

153
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,089
只要花一半的时间
Be at the orchid in half the time.

154
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,065
让我猜猜,到了那里你一定知道我们该怎么做
And let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.

155
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,070
不  一点都不知道
No, not exactly at all,

156
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,061
但是我知道Ben就是用它离开这个岛的
But I know that Ben used it to leave the island.

157
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,019
如果我照样做  我们也可以得救
And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.

158
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:18,006
那你要怎么做呢
And how you gonna do that?

159
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,020
这里发生的一切都是因为他们离开了
This is all happening because they left.

160
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:23,087
我认为如果把他们带回来  这一切就会停止
I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.

161
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:28,002
-把谁带回来  -Jack  Sun  Sayid  Hugo  Kate
- Bring who back? - Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.

162
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,038
船炸毁了  而直升机很可能在上面
The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.

163
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,058
他们没有死  James
They're not dead, James.

164
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:34,098
-谁说的  -那无关紧要
- Says who? - That doesn't matter.

165
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,015
重要的是他们会回来
All that matters is they've gotta come back.

166
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,059
我必须让他们回来
I have to make them come back...

167
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,022
即使会让我丧命
Even if it kills me.

168
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,076
你不想让他们回来吗  James
Don't you want 'em to come back, James?

169
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:51,052
你不想让她回来吗
Don't you want her to come back?

170
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,079
我想什么无关紧要
It doesn't matter what I want.

171
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,026
她醒了
She's waking up!

172
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:10,029
你还好吗
Are you okay?

173
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,015
你是谁
Who are you?

174
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,091
是我啊
It's me.

175
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,069
Danniel啊

176

又来了一次闪光  你晕倒了

180

181
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:42,015
有点儿晕  但是
A bit dizzy, but...

182
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,045

00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,081
现在怎么办
Now what?

186
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:53,028
我告诉你怎么办
I'll tell you "now what."

187
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,026
我们要回兰花站
We're going to the orchid.

Sayid  你已经失去知觉42个小时
Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours.

191
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,098
你的身体里的镇定剂相当于一匹马用的三倍
You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer In your system.

192
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:27,012
如果你已经派那个人去Hurley家

193
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,035
我们现在就得离开

你需要放松  Ben不会伤害Hurley

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,070
怎么回事
What happened?

306
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,074
你看到什么了吗  James
Did you see something out here, james?

307
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,079
无所谓了
Don't matter.

308
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,097
已经消失了
It's gone now.

309
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:22,019
你刮胡子了
You shaved your beard.

310
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,039
是呀
Yeah.

311
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,014
想要改变一下
Just needed a change.

312
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,087
听着  Jack
Look, jack, uh...

313
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:37,027
我不知道你为什么来电话
I don't know why you called,

314
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:40,062
但我现在什么都做不了
But I can't be dealing with this right now.

315
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:44,096
出什么事了
What's going on?

316
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:46,051
没事  只是
Nothing. just...

317
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,040
-走吧  好吗  -为什么不告诉我
- Can you just go?  - why don't you just tell me?

318
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,016
Jack  求你走吧
Jack, please, just go.

319
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:53,021
Kate  告诉我
Kate, please, tell me.

320
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,030
有人想要Aaron
Somebody wants aaron.

321
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,056
什么
What?

322
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,033
有一个律师
There's a lawyer in there.

323
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,036
他的客户  他们知道我们在说谎
His clients-- they know we're lying.

324
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,086
他们知道我不是他妈妈
They know I'm not his mom,

325
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,040
要把他带走
And they're gonna take him away.

326
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,044
谁要把他带走
Who's gonna take him away?

327
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,083
你要干什么
What--what are you doing?

328
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:21,007
我得走了  你上不上车
Look, I gotta go, all right? get in or don't.

329
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,063
喂
Hey.

330
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:41,063
能告诉我你在那看见了谁吗
You ready to tell me who you saw back there?

331
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:44,073
我都说了  没什么
Already told you. it was nothin'.

332
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:48,020
我们都知道闪光之前的时间  James
You and I both know when we were before the flash, james.

333
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,033
你到底看见谁了
So who was it you saw?

334
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,003
Charlie  Shannon  还是你自己
Charlie? shannon? yourself?

335
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:58,056
你怎么会知道当时的时间  小Johnny
And how is it that you knew when we were, johnny boy?

336
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:03,001
那束光  是从舱门过来的  对吗
That light in the sky--it was from the hatch, wasn't it?

337
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:08,006
Boone死的那天晚上
The night that boone died...

338
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,073
我去了那里
I went out there

339
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:12,070
用尽全力的砸门
And started pounding on it as hard as I could.

340
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,076
我很困惑  很害怕
I was... confused... scared.

341
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,023
像个白痴一样说傻话
Babbling like an idiot,

342
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:22,050
问着  为什么要发生在我身上
Asking, why was all this happening to me?

343
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,020
找到答案了吗
Did you get an answer?

344
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,083
灯光亮起来  直射入空中
Light came on, shot up into the sky.

345
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:30,030
那时  我以为这有什么含义
At the time, I thought it meant something.

346
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,020
有吗
Did it?

347
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,096
没有  只是灯光
No. it was just a light.

348
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:37,063
你为什么带我们绕道
So why'd you turn us around then?

349
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:40,044
你不想回到那里吗
Don't you wanna go back there?

350
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,086
我干吗要那样做
Why would I wanna do that?

351
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,036
因此你就能说服自己做一些与众不同的事
So you could tell yourself to do things different,

352
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,086
脱离苦海
Save yourself a world of pain.

353
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:53,031
不  我需要这些痛苦来知道自己身处何地
No, I needed that pain to get to where I am now.

354
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,053
我刚刚流鼻血了
I just got a nosebleed.

355
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:08,026
什么  什么时候的事
What? when?

356
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:12,000
我们先别惊动到其他人  好吗
Let's just not freak out the others, okay?

357
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,020
告诉我
Just tell me...

358
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,073
-为什么她和我会这样  -我不知道
- Why--why her? why me? - I don't know.

359
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:18,073
我认为是和
Uh, I think it might have something to do

360
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,050
暴露在磁场的时间长短有关
With duration of exposure.

361
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:22,050
也就是你在岛上待的总时间
You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.

362
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:24,033
这个解释说不通
Doesn't make any sense.

363
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,056
那群笨蛋已经在这里待了好几个月
Those yahoos have been here for months.

364
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:30,084
-我两个星期前才踏上这个岛的  -你确定吗
- I've never been here before two weeks ago. - Are you sure about that?

365
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:39,044
营地又回来了
The camp's back

366
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,097
总算到了
Finally.

367
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:44,041
有没有人想来瓶达摩啤酒
Anybody for a dharma beer?

368
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,074
有人吗  有人在吗
Hello? anybody here?

369
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,052
Rose  Bernard
Rose  Bernard

370
00:24:56,045 --> 00:25:00,012
我好奇这是什么时候发生的事情
I wonder how long ago this happened.

371
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:04,072
王八蛋
Son of a bitch!

372
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:09,007
这是什么
What is it?

373
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,087
是Vincent的
It's Vincent's.

374
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:13,054
是吗  那狗跑哪了
Yeah? well, where's the rest of the dog?

375
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:16,075
我们剩下的人哪去了
Where's the rest of our people?

376
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,084
Zodiac号也不见了
The Zodiac's gone, too.

377
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,004
也许你们其他的人把船开走了
Maybe your people took the boat.

378
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,091
到底为什么他们会那样做
Why the hell would they do that?

379
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,018
为了逃离乘这些玩意过来的人
To get away from whoever came in those.

380
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,075
这些玩意哪里来的
Where did these come from?

381
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,038
问得好
That's a good question.

382
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,001
看起来很古老
They're pretty old.

383
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:42,044
也没多古老
Not that old.

384
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:44,085
我看看
Let me see that.

385
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,084
"adg-uh-ruh"
adg-uh-ruh

386
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,051
Ajira  是个航空公司
Ajira. it's an airline.

387
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,083
是个印度航空公司  但飞往世界各地
It's based out of india, but they fly everywhere.

388
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,004
太好了,也许今晚他们有航班从这里飞往拉斯维加斯
Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to vegas tonight.

389
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,081
乘这些船的是谁  还有其他人吗
-Who came in these? other others?

390
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,087
别看我
Don't look at me.

391
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:03,070
问题是  他们什么时候回来
My question is, when are they coming back?

392
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:06,044
我们别干等着  一起去搞清楚
Let's not wait to find out.

393
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,073
如果我们是开摩托艇
This plan sounded a hell of a lot better

394
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:37,033
这计划会感觉更好
When we were going by motorboat.

395
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:39,090
我们离那地方多远
How far is this place?

396
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:43,060
就在那个转角后头  就几个小时
It's around that point. not more than a couple hours.

397
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,001
噢  有意思了
Oh, joy.

398
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:52,040
你还好吗
You all right?

399
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,093
我看到Kate了
I saw Kate.

400
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:55,085
什么
What?

401
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:58,097
昨晚  在丛林里
Last night, in the jungle.

402
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,072
在上次闪光出现之前
Before the last flash.

403
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:08,025
她正在帮Claire接生
She was delivering Claire's baby.

404
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,055
但那是两个月之前的事了
But that was two months ago.

405
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,027
穿越时间真不是玩意
Time travel's a bitch.

406
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,038
趴下
Get down!

407
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,075
-我想他们是要把船抢回来  -加把劲
- I think they want their boat back! - Move!

408
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:36,050
-他们和你一伙的吗  -不  是你们的人吗
- These your people?! - No! are they yours?!

409
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,035
闭嘴  继续划
Shut up and keeping paddling!

410
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:46,031
没用  没用
Little help! little help!

411
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:56,045
划快点  他们越来越靠近了
Paddle harder! they're getting closer!

412
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:05,065
感谢上帝
Thank you,lord!

413
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:16,047
我收回刚刚说的话
I take that back!

414
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:19,045
大家往岸边划
Everybody, paddle! head for the shore!

415
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:44,053
Kate  那家伙告诉你
Kate, just because the guy

416
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,090
他准备去见他的客户
Told you that he was meeting his client

417
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,013
不代表他们就在洛杉矶
Doesn't mean that they're here in l.a.

418
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,046
他可能只是这么说来  来打发你
He could've just told you that to--to throw you off.

419
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,047
或者是他们现在就在那个宾馆里头
Or they're in that hotel right now.

420
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,042
好吧  就算你说的是对的
Okay. and what if they are?

421
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,089
如果那个想夺走Aaron的人
What if the person who wants to take aaron

422
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,056
就坐在宾馆里
Is sitting in that hotel room right now?

423
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,079
又怎么样
Then what?

424
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,079
拜托  和我一起走
Come on. come with me.

425
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,079
我们先接走Aaron
We'll--we'll go get aaron,

426
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,079
然后再想办法
We'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.

427
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,063
好吧
All right.

428
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,060
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

429
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,070
是Claire的母亲
It's Claire's mother.

430
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:56,007
等等
Wait.

431
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:58,024
-我还等什么  Jack  -等等  我只是
- What am I waiting for, Jack? - Wait. I just...

432
00:29:58,025 --> 00:30:00,097
-我们先整理下头绪  -她知道了
- Let's just think about this for a minute. - She knows.

433
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,098
也许她还不知道
Maybe she doesn't know.

434
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,008
不  但她知道Aaron的存在  这就够要命的了
No, but she knows about aaron, and that's all that matters!

435
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,084
我去和她谈谈
Let me go talk to her.

436
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:11,007
什么
What?

437
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,097
如果我能向她解释清楚这么做的原因
If I can just explain to her why we did it--

438
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:17,020
也许我可能让她明白事情的缘由
Maybe if I can get her to understand why...

439
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,071
她会听我的
She'll listen to me.

440
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:24,068
我能处理好的  Kate  我会处理好的
I can fix this, kate. I can fix it.

441
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,038
Aaron也是我的家人
Aaron is my family, too.

442
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:06,000
Shephard医生
Dr. Shephard?

443
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,060
你好  Littleton女士
Hello, Ms. Littleton. um...

444
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,024
我能进来吗
May I come in?

445
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,088
当然
Of course.

446
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,094
你全身都淋湿了
You look drenched.

447
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:20,017
不  不  不  我没事
No, no. no, I'm fine.

448
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:23,021
天啊  自从你父亲的葬礼后我们就没再见过面
God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral.

449
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,051
你怎么知道我在这的
How did you even know I was here?

450
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:31,077
我知道你在这里  Littleton女士
I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton,

451
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,090
是因为我跟踪了你的律师
Because I followed your lawyer.

452
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,050
你为什么要这样做
Why would you do that?

453
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:41,058
我这样做是因为
I'm--i did it because, um...

454
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:45,014
我理解你为什么想这样做
I understand that you feel the need to do this.

455
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,014
但是我希望你能明白
But I need you to know

456
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:51,062
我和Kate做的一切事情  都是为了Aaron
That everything that kate and I have done--it was for aaron.

457
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:57,092
谁是Aaron
Who's... Aaron?

她一直以为Claire已经死了

470
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:40,001
她甚至也不知道Aaron的存在
She doesn't even know that aaron exists.

471
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,074
-但律师  -她起诉了大洋航空

472
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:44,033
她来城里打点行装
And she's in town to pick up her settlement.

473
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:46,024
如果她的律师和要带走我儿子的人

他们没什么针对Reyes的具体案件

法医称在Santa Rosa外发现的那个男人

我们今天上午有个预备听证会
We have a prelim hearing in the morning.

491
00:33:57,075 --> 00:34:00,011
法官不会让这通过的
The judge will never let it get past that,

492
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:02,007
Reyes会无罪释放的
And reyes will be a free man.

493
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,044

-我们在哪  -天亮前说不清
-Where are we? -it's hard to say till it gets light.

500
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:49,084
我们还没机会把上次的话说完

他们开始射杀我们前的谈话

站出来和她说话的

像才坠毁的样子

Jack  干嘛今天打电话给我
Jack, why did you call me today?
