00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,077
等等  Hurley告诉过我
Wait, Hurley showed me.

4
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,003
就在这附近
It's around here somewhere.

5
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,033
肯定是的...在...
It's definitely... around...

6
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,009
-快点  Charlie  -噢  呃...
-Quckly, Charlie  -It's...  uh...

7
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,047
-我们快没时间了  Charlie.  -好的  好的
-It's definitely... around...  -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

8
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,035
就在这了
Here it is!

9
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:30,026
我就说么
Told you.

10
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,005
当心  当心  炸药很不稳定
Be careful. Be careful. Dynamite is very unstable.

11
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,047
别像Arzt博士一样
You don't wanna end up like Dr. Arzt.

12
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,083
小心
Be careful.

13
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,091
Eko...

14
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,025
嘿  Eko
Hey! Eko.

15
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,083
听着...
Listen.

16
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:53,058
如果我们伤了他们怎么办?
What if we hurt them?

17
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,082
或是...或是炸坏了电脑?
Or blow up the computer?

18
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,061
你可以走了  Charlie
You can leave now Charlie.

19
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:05,013
John  我是Charlie
John? It's Charlie.

20
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,035
我们来想想办法  John
Let's work this thing out, John.

21
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:12,059
John  Eko很生气  John
John! Eko is very upset, John.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,015
把门打开  我们谈谈
Let's just open this door, and we can talk about it.

23
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:20,061
John  你要知道Eko要把门炸开
John, you should know Eko is gonna blow open the blast door.

24
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,058
用什么炸开?
Blow it open with what?

25
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:25,076
用炸药  那些从古船拿来的炸药
With dynamite from the old ship in the jungle!

26
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,002
用原子弹才行  伙计
It would take an atom bomb, brother.

27
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,020
告诉他们别白费力气
Tell him not to bother.

28
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,036
你肯定不会被炸开?
You're sure it'll hold?

29
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:34,085
是的
Aye.

30
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:37,057
我确定
I'm sure.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,082
6...5...
Six. Five.

32
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:52,068
4...3...2...1
Four. Three. Two. One.

33
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,058
你怎么记得你上次画到哪里了?
How do you even remember where you left off from?

34
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,084
慢慢的  慢慢的
Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly.

35
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,094
伙计  你真得看看Radzinksy是怎么做的
You should've seen Radzinsky do this.

36
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,037
他有照相机般的记忆
He had a photographic memory.

37
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:29,022
我是说  这全是他的主意
I mean, this whole baby was his idea.

38
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:31,056
恩  是的  Radzinsky
Yeah, right, Radzinsky.

39
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,038
Radzinsky发现了如何启动这假警报
Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown

40
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:38,037
Radzinsky创造了这幅伟大的隐形地图
Radzinsky created this great invisible map.

41
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,026
我听了很多你搭档的传奇故事了
More and more tales about your former partner,

42
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:42,083
但是你却不告诉我
yet for some reason you never want to tell me

43
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,011
他到底发生了什么事
what bloody well happened to him.

44
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,073
看见那个褐色的痕迹了么?
See that brown stain there?

45
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,027
那就是Radzinsky留下的
That's Radzinsky.

46
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:04,036
在我睡觉的时候他朝自己嘴里开了一枪
He put a shotgun in his mouth when I was asleep.

47
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,014
这混蛋这么做了  
The bitch of it was

48
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,047
搞得我只有108分钟来埋葬他
I only had 108 minutes to bury the poor bastard.

49
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:19,069
恩  如果你不想让我也疯掉...
Well, if you don't want me to go crazy,

50
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,038
下次让我去外面做任务
next time let me go out.

51
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,065
你想去外面么
Oh, you want to go out there

52
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,040
去和检疫与敌人战斗?
with the quarantine and the hostiles?

53
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,079
我已经两年没出去过了
I haven't been outside for two bloody years!

54
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,068
是的  我要去  我曾经是军人
Yes, I want to go. I was the army for...

55
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,038
对了  女皇的军队  是么?
Oh, right. Her Majesty's Army, correct?

56
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:37,059
告诉我  Desmond
Tell me, Desmond

57
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:40,003
为什么你要离开那个漂亮的老女人的军队?
why did you leave that nice old lady's army?

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,004
我记起来了
Oh, I remember now

59
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:45,046
你因为不服从命令而被赶出来了
You got kicked out because you couldn't follow orders.

60
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:47,079
那你为什么离开你的军队  Kelvin?
And why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh?

61
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:51,097
因为人们都要听从我的指挥
Because men followed my orders.

62
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,017
但是后来  谢天谢地  我加入了达摩启动计划
But then, thank God, I joined the Dharma Initiative.

63
00:04:56,017 --> 00:05:00,072
合十感谢  感谢你们  并祝你们好运
"Namaste, thank you, and good luck. "

64
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,013
求你了  Kelvin
Please, Kelvin.

65
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,012
让我出去
Let me go out.

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,050
就一次
Just once.

67
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:17,035
对不起  伙计  你呆在这
Sorry, Des. You stay here.

68
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,008
你来按按键
You push the button.

69
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,091
那是命令
That's order.

70
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,038
John

71
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:32,054
听着  没开玩笑  你就要被炸飞了
Look, seriously, you're about to be detonated!

72
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,015
如果John是对的呢?
Hey. What if John's right?

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,066
也许这只是个天大的玩笑
Maybe it's just some colossal joke.

74
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,043
你知道  这只是一台什么都没连着的电脑
You know, it's just some old computer connected to nothing.

75
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:52,029
也许只是一些电线...
Maybe it's just a bunch of wires that...

76
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,034
那是个玩笑么?
Is that a joke?

77
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,057
我还是出去吧
I'll see myself out.

78
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:21,089
John  最后给你一次机会
John! This is your last chance to end this.

79
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,047
打开门  我就原谅你
Open the door, and I will forgive you.

80
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,026
原谅我什么
Forgive me for what?

81
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,001
嘿  Eko?
Hey. Eko?

82
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,033
再等等
Just wait a second.

83
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:47,024
我不...我不觉得这是个好主意  Eko
I don't... I don't think it's a good idea, Eko.

84
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:50,015
我们空间太小了
We're in a very confined area.

85
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,020
胡说
Oh, bollocks!

86
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,059
Kelvin

87
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:36,098
嘿  Kelvin
Hey, Kelvin!

88
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,078
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

89
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,091
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

90
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,050
这是什么?
What is this?

91
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,001
这是唯一的另一条出路  伙计
This is the only other way out, partner.

92
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:37,027
自动防故障装置  把钥匙一转  一切都会结束了
Fail-safe. Just turn this key, and this all goes away.

93
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,076
墙后面是什么  Kelvin?
What's behind that wall, Kelvin?

94
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,067
恩?
Huh?

95
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,092
那个意外是什么?
What was the incident?

96
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,077
是电磁
Electromagnetism.

97
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:54,020
独特的地质现象
Geologically unique.

98
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:57,082
意外就是...电磁泄露了
The incident? It was a leak.

99
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:59,061
现在正在充电
So now the charge builds up

100
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,048
每次我们按按键
and every time we push the button

101
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,003
电力就放掉一点...
it discharges it.

102
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,071
这样就不会使磁力太强
Before it gets too big.

103
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,083
为什么要我们来...按按键?
Why make us do it? Push the button?

104
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,018
如果我们...如果我们...
If we can just...

105
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:18,020
这就是问题所在了  Desmond...
Now here's the real question, Desmondo

106
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,028
你有勇气
Do you have the courage

107
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,010
伸出你的手
to take your finger out of the dam

108
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:26,039
来结束这一切么?
blow the whole thing up instead?

109
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,006
我想你的朋友们炸伤他们自己了  伙计
I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother.

110
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,043
也许我们该把门打开
Maybe we should open it.

111
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:38,093
不  不
No! No.

112
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,091
这是个骗局
It's a trick.

113
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:44,019
一个骗局?  他们可能受伤了
A trick? They could be hurt.

114
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,059
你们医生在附近么?
Is your doctor around?

115
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,066
能问你个问题么  伙计?
Can I ask you a question, brother?

116
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:54,018
当然
Absolutely.

117
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,086
这是否就是你让这钟
Is the reason you're letting that clock there

118
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:02,008
走完最后一秒的原因...
run all the way down to the very last tick...

119
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,091
因为你需要查明真相...
Is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun...

120
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,067
来找到你真正相信的东西  John?
...and find out what you really believe, John?

121
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:13,031
我之所以要查到底
I looked down the barrel of the gun.

122
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,018
是因为我相信
And I believed.

123
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,094
我以为...
I thought...

124
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:24,043
来到这里是我的命运
it was my destiny to get into this... place.

125
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,072
而且...有些人死了
And somebody died.

126
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:30,087
你知道  一个孩子...因为他愚蠢到相信
A kid. Because he was stupid enough to believe

127
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,076
我所知道的和我所说的
that I knew what I was talking about.

128
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,072
那晚他死得毫无意义
And on the night he died for nothing

129
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,069
我独自一个人呆在这上面
I was sitting right up there all alone

130
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,026
用我的手敲着...
beating my hand bloody against that...

131
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:46,001
该死的舱门
stupid door.

132
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:49,054
朝天大喊  问我到底应该怎么做
Screaming to the heavens, asking what should I do.

133
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:52,030
然后亮出了一道光线
And then a light went on.

134
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,084
我以为这是一个暗示
I thought it was a sign.

135
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,089
但这不是什么暗示
But it wasn't a sign.

136
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,015
可能只是你去了洗手间
Probably just you going to the bathroom.

137
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,014
Jack?

138
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,040
它们是什么?
What are they?

139
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,024
是手写的
It's handwritten.

140
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:26,048
整本书都是...
And it's all filled. The whole book.

141
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,030
都是些日志
They're journal entries.

142
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:34,077
0400...S.R. 再次移动了乒乓桌
0400. S.R. Moves Ping-Pong table again.

143
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:37,084
0415...淋浴
0415. Takes a shower.

144
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:39,028
这是什么?
What is this?

145
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:42,007
医生  你说过Sayid到达海滩
Hey, doc? What'd you say Sayid's sign

146
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:45,085
解决了那里的海滩派对以后会给我们发信号
was when the coast was clear to hit that beach party?

147
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,093
那就说明他找到他们了  是么?
That means he found them, right?

148
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,065
那离这里还很远
That's miles from here.

149
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,070
你在把我们往哪里带?
Where were you taking us?

150
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,082
-什么?  -Sayid说他会点起信号
-What?  -Sayid said he'd light the signal

151
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:02,022
这样我们就可以在岸边和他会合了
so we'd meet him at the shore.

152
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:03,080
-我们为什么没去海滩?  -我们就是去...
-Why aren't we going to the beach?  -We are.

153
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,088
-我们根本不是去海滩  -听着  我不得不...
-We're nowhere near the beach!  -I had to.

154
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,003
什么?
What?

155
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,083
Sawyer

156
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,016
快走  快逃  快逃
Run! Go! Go!

157
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,013
等等  等等
Hold on. Wait!

158
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:16,049
你找到的另一个舱子...
Tell me about this other hatch you found.

159
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,064
那个...珍珠
This... Pearl.

160
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:21,069
珍珠是一个监测站
The Pearl is a psychological station

161
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,057
摆满了监视器
full of TV monitors.

162
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:26,034
两个人坐在椅子上
two men sat in X chairs

163
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:29,016
在记事本上写观测到的
and filled notebooks with observations

164
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,023
这里发生的情况
on what happens in here.

165
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,085
然后他们把记事本放进空的容器
And then they put the notebooks in pneumatic tubes

166
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:34,050
送给他们的指挥部
that sent them to their headquarters

167
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,067
这样他们就能用我们来做试验了
so they could evaluate us as an experiment.

168
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,053
什么?
What?

169
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,023
-如果你反过来想一想呢?  -反过来?
-What if you've got it backwards?  -Backwards?

170
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,099
如果试验对象不是这里的两个人
What if the experiment wasn't on the two men here

171
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,025
而是那里的两个人呢?
but on the two men in there?

172
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:54,059
听着  我想看那卷录影带  John
I want to see that tape, John.

173
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,066
不  你在这里无法看到
No, you can't. There's no way to see it down here.

174
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,027
在那个站里还有别的东西么?
Was there anything else in that station?

175
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,065
-有电脑么?  -有的
-A computer?  -Yeah.

176
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:04,044
-那是用来干吗的?  -没用  那个电脑没什么用
-So, what did it do?  -Nothing! It didn't do anything.

177
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,077
它打印出数字...很多很多的数字  
It printed out numbers. Lots of numbers.

178
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,067
What printer? Where is it?
什么数字?  在哪?

179
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,023
给你  剩下的19分钟好好读吧
Here. Reading material for the next 19 minutes.

180
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,052
省得没事干
Knock yourself out.

181
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,059
三年来你天天刮胡子
You've been shaving for the last three years.

182
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,033
你应该留着一点
You need to live a little.

183
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,070
让它长出来
Let go.

184
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,018
我不会让它长出来的  伙计
I'm never gonna let go, brother.

185
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:41,064
噢  那就是动力了
Oh, that's the spirit.

186
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:44,007
再见  伙计
Goodbye, Des.

187
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,094
再见?
Goodbye?

188
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:51,086
是的
Yeah.

189
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,091
再见
Goodbye.

190
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,002
几小时后见
See you in a couple hours.

191
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,006
真糟糕  我没想到
Well, gosh. I didn't think

192
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,094
你靠石头的掩护来跟踪我
you had the stones to come after me.

193
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,078
我已经有十年的经验了
I was a spook for ten years, Des.

194
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,051
当有人跟踪我时我是知道的
I know when I'm being followed.

195
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:55,052
-你拿我的船来做什么?  -我正在修
-What are you doing with my boat?  -I'm fixing it.

196
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:57,054
你要走了?
You were leaving?

197
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:00,081
恩  我是说  不是现在 还要一周左右才能修好
Well, I mean, not yet. She's still about a week away.

198
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,071
你把它损坏得够呛的
You wrecked her pretty good, Des.

199
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,086
你怎么想?  你想和我一起走么?
So, what do you think? Want to come with me?

200
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,060
去哪里?
Come where?

201
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,043
按键怎么办?
What about the button?

202
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:16,043
忘了那个按键吧  伙计 谁知道它是不是真的?
Screw the button, man. Who knows if it's even real?

203
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:21,048
你可不是这么说的
when you were going on about dams and electromagnetics and fail-safes!

204
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,034
我当时喝醉了
I was drunk.

205
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,004
你为什么要骗我?
Why did you lie to me?

206
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,066
我需要另一个人来拯救世界
I needed a sucker to save the world after I left.

207
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,056
你这个疯子  你这个混蛋
You're crazy! You bastard!

208
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:33,003
-好了  -你毁了我的生命
-Oh, come on.  -You stole my life!

209
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,083
你还骗了我什么?  还有呢?
What else did you lie to me about? What else?

210
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,003
告诉我告诉我
Tell me!

211
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:45,099
你怎么能这么对我?  起来
How could you do this to me? Get up.

212
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:56,015
天那
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

213
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:25,083
错误...系统错误
Failure. System failure.

214
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:52,020
系统错误
System failure.

215
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,032
拜托
Come on!

216
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:58,008
系统错误
System failure.

217
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,041
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

218
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,081
你们什么时候来的?
When did you come here?

219
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,070
什么?
What?

220
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,017
这个岛
The island.

221
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:40,061
你们什么时候来的  多久前? 
When did you come here? How long ago?

222
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,025
60到65天前吧
Sixty, 65 days.

223
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,088
-具体日期?  具体是什么时候?  -9月22号
-The date! What was the date?  -September 22nd.

224
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,072
是9月22号
It was September 22nd

225
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:00,067
我想是我让你们坠机了
I think I crashed your plane.

226
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,051
狗娘养的  我要踢死...
Son of a bitch, I'll kick your...

227
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,053
大家都静一静
Everybody just calm down!

228
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,002
是假的
It's fake.

229
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:41,056
我们知道你胡子是假的
We know that your beard is fake.

230
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,043
抱歉  小姑娘  我没听懂
Sorry, missy. I didn't get you.

231
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,034
她说她知道你胡子是假的  Tom
She says she knows your beard's fake, Tom.

232
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:49,090
恩  谢谢你指出  Kate
Well, thanks for pointing that out, Kate.

233
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:53,032
我得告诉你这东西真的很痒
I can't tell you how much this thing itches.

234
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:56,024
还要谢谢你告诉他们我的名字  Bea
And thanks for telling them my name, Bea.

235
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:45,054
你们好
Hello, again.

236
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:56,034
你的胡子呢?
Where's your beard?

237
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,021
我想...他们知道了
I think... they know...

238
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:09,033
好了  我们开始谈我们的交易吧  好么?
All right. Let's take care of business, shall we?

239
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:45,040
Eko  Eko

240
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,025
我是Charlie
It's Charlie.

241
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,045
醒醒
Wake up!

242
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:00,035
-不  我们得按按键  -不  我们不能按
-We need to push the button.  -No, we don't.

243
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:03,009
你没听我说么  伙计?  是我让你们坠机的
Did you not hear me? I crashed your plane.

244
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,023
你怎么做的?
How did you manage to do that?

245
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:07,003
那天  这些数字变成了象形文字
On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics.

246
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:08,020
当最后一个稳定下来时
When the last one came down

247
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,060
整个地方就开始摇晃了  屏幕上...
this place started to shake.

248
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,034
屏幕上打满了"系统错误"
That screen filled up with "system failure. "

249
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,062
系统错误
"System failure. "

250
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:16,004
这里的数字...92204...
And that number there: 92204.

251
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:18,029
9月22号  2004年...
September the 22nd, 2004.

252
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:21,042
你们坠机的那天  是真的  都是真的
The day your plane crashed. It's real! It's all bloody real!

253
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:24,005
-现在按这该死的按键  -我知道我看到了什么
-Now push the damn button! -I know what I saw!

254
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:28,017
都是骗人的  都不是真的  全部都是假的
It's a lie! It's not real! None of it is real!

255
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:31,001
你不想按按键么?  那么我来按
You don't want to push the button? Then I will.

256
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:32,014
不
No!

257
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:46,026
你杀了我们
You've killed us.

258
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:49,052
你把我们全杀了
You've killed us all.

259
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,001
不
No.

260
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:54,019
我救了我们大家
I just saved us all.

261
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:08,086
Eko  醒醒
Hey! Eko! Wake up.

262
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,034
可以帮忙么
Hey! Can I get some help?

263
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:15,074
-可以帮帮我么  -我是在帮你  伙计
-Can you help me?  -I'm trying, brother!

264
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:10,003
亲爱的  在你离开监狱的时候
Dearest Des. I'm writing this letter to you

265
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,032
我写这封信给你
as you leave for prison.

266
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,037
我把它藏在了你在完全绝望时
And I've hidden it in the one place

267
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:17,000
会去看的地方
you would turn to in a moment of great desperation.

268
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,085
我知道你走
I know you go away

269
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,036
是因为
with the weight

270
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:21,048
你肩上的压力
of what happened on your shoulders.

271
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:24,092
而且我知道只有你自己才能甩掉压力
And I know the only person who can ever take it off is you.

272
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:29,030
别放弃  亲爱的
Please don't give up, Des.

273
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:31,077
因为我们需要赖以为生的
Because all we really need to survive

274
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:34,080
是一个真正爱我们的人
is one person who truly loves us.

275
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,081
现在你得到了
And you have her.

276
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:40,029
我会等你的  永远
I will wait for you always.

277
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,085
我爱你
I love you

278
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:43,043
Pen

279
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,095
都结束了
It's all gone.

280
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:11,027
都...都结束了
It's all... It's all gone.

281
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,088
全都结束了
All gone!

282
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:57,076
我做了任何你要求我做的事
I've done everything you wanted me to do

283
00:28:57,096 --> 00:29:01,025
那么你为什么这么做?  为什么?
so why did you do this? Why?

284
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,052
你们下来的三天前
Three days before you came down here

285
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,039
在我们见面之前
before we met

286
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:48,055
我听见敲打舱门的声音  有人在大喊
I heard a banging on the hatch door, shouting.

287
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,036
那人就是你  John  不是么?
But it was you, John, wasn't it?

288
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,020
你说没什么事是注定发生的
You say there isn't any purpose?

289
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,092
没有命运这么一回事?
No such thing as fate?

290
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:57,034
但是你救了我  伙计 所以我要救你
But you saved my life, brother. So that I could save yours.

291
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,090
不不不  这些都不是真的
Don't! No! No! None of this is real!

292
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,006
不会发生什么事的  我们会没事的
Nothing is gonna happen! We're gonna be OK!

293
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,096
我必须要这么做
I've got to go

294
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:07,038
你得离这里越远越好
and you've got to get as far away from here as possible.

295
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,082
去哪里?  停下
Go where? Stop!

296
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,066
我要炸了这里  John
I'm gonna blow the dam, John.

297
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,090
我很抱歉有些事让你不再相信这个
I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing.

298
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,006
但这全是真的
But it's all real.

299
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:21,086
现在我要去结束这一切了
And now I've got to go and make it all go away.

300
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,071
等等  Desmond
Wait! Desmond?

301
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,072
在新生活中再见了  伙计
I'll see you in another life, brother.

302
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:32,086
系统错误  系统错误
System failure.

303
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,055
系统错误
System failure.

304
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:39,082
Eko  醒醒
Eko! Eko! Wake up!

305
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,090
你还好吧?
You all right?

306
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,034
不
No.

307
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:24,085
天哪
Oh, my God!

308
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,056
-好了  跟我来  -Charlie...
-Come on! Come with me!  -Charlie...

309
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:32,068
-不  我不...  -离开这里 快点
-No! Hang on!  -Get out of here! Go!

310
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,050
John

311
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:42,042
Eko

312
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:45,032
John

313
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,079
是我错了
I was wrong.

314
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,014
我们需要赖以为生的
All we really need to survive

315
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:32,020
是一个真正爱我们的人
is one person who truly loves us.

316
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,069
现在你得到了
And you have her.

317
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:36,042
我会等你的
I will wait for you

318
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:38,037
永远
always.

319
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,051
我爱你
I love you.

320
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,031
我爱你  Penny
I love you, Penny.

321
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,037
Charlie?

322
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:18,067
你没事吧?
You OK?

323
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,088
只是...
It's

324
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:23,087
很难说清楚  但我的耳朵  你知道
It's hard to tell exactly, Bernard. My ears... You know?

325
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:27,077
-Locke和Eko呢?  -他们还没回来么?
-Where's Locke? Eko?  -They're not back yet?

326
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,095
没有
No.

327
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:42,084
我对你的安排
I'm not happy about the arrangement

328
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:44,018
感到非常不满意 Michael
that was made with you. Michael

329
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:46,059
但是当Walt加入我们后
but we got more than we bargained for

330
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,050
我们得到的比预计的多
when Walt joined us.

331
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,006
所以我认为那是最好的方面
So I suppose this is what's best.

332
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,035
并且你放了我
And you let me go. Set me free.

333
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,029
你遵守了诺言
You lived up to your word.

334
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,060
我们也遵守我们的诺言
We live up to our word too.

335
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:07,072
你知道怎么开船么?
You know how to drive a boat?

336
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:11,017
-是的  我会开  -好的  那艘船给你
-I can drive a boat.  -Good. You're gonna take this boat

337
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,048
顺着指南针325的方向开
and follow a compass bearing of 325.

338
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:14,071
如果你准确按照方向的话
And if you do that exactly

339
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:18,037
你和你的儿子就获救了
you and your son will find rescue.

340
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,023
什么  就这样了?
What, that's it?

341
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:23,099
我照着方向开  我和我儿子就获救了
I follow the bearing, and me and my son get rescued?

342
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,012
是的
Yes.

343
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:28,047
你怎么知道我不会告诉人们
How do you know I won't tell people

344
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,072
这个岛在哪里?
about where I was?

345
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,079
也许你会  也许你不会
Maybe you will, and maybe you won't.

346
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:36,056
但是都无关紧要
But it won't matter.

347
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:39,006
一旦你走了 你再也不可能回来了
Once you leave, you'll never be able to get back here.

348
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:43,062
并且我相信你是不会和别人说起的
And my hunch is you won't say a word to anybody.

349
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:44,081
因为一旦你说了
Because if you do

350
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,091
人们就会知道
people will find out

351
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:48,018
你是怎么要回你儿子的
what you did to get your son back.

352
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:55,040
我的朋友们
My friends.

353
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:58,022
你保证过不会伤害他们的
I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.

354
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,028
说话算话
A deal's a deal.

355
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:07,082
你们到底是谁?
Who are you people?

356
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:12,012
我们是好人  Michael
We're the good guys, Michael.

357
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,088
好了  它是你的了
All right. She's all yours.

358
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,024
什么? 我是傻子么? 我儿子呢?
What? What, am I stupid? Where is my son?

359
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,002
Walt就在里面
Walt's inside.

360
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:32,029
Walt?

361
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,032
旅途愉快  Michael
Bon voyage, Michael.

362
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,032
Walt

363
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:44,083
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Dad!

364
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,092
过来  过来
Come here. Come here.

365
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:53,000
-你还好吧?  -是的  我很好
-You OK?  -Yeah, I'm OK.

366
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,038
你肯定么?
You sure?

367
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:56,061
好了  我带回你了
OK. I got you now.

368
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,024
现在没事了  我们回家了  Walt
It's gonna be OK, now. We're going home, Walt.

369
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,050
我们回家了
We are going home.

370
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:28,078
Hugo  你可以回去了
Hugo, you can go back to your camp.

371
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:31,074
什么?
What?

372
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,050
回去
Go back.

373
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:37,075
你的工作就是告诉你们剩下的人
Your job is to tell the rest of your people

374
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:40,018
叫他们别来这里
they can never come here.

375
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,058
但是...我的朋友呢?
But what about my friends?

376
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,090
你的朋友们和我们一起回家
Your friends are coming home with us.

377
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,056
走吧
Go.

378
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:35,061
发生了什么事  Charlie?
What happened out there, Charlie?

379
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,073
你想听
You want to hear the part

380
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:40,086
我差点被那个闪光的火球杀死
about me nearly being killed by the flaming fire ball

381
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,024
还是差点被那个飞来的叉子叉死?
or the flying fork?

382
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,063
我要你认真的说
I want you to be serious.

383
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,021
什么都没发生
Nothing happened.

384
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:53,005
发生了很多事情
Well, something happened.

385
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,013
我是说  那些声音
I mean, that noise

386
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,077
还有天空变成了紫罗兰色
and the sky turned that weird violet color.

387
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,098
真的么?
Did it?

388
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:16,030
我击垮了你的防守

389
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,083
你的车已经没有了

390
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:23,002
这都是计划的一部分  朋友

391
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,017
啊  那你的计划就是失败了

392
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,019
快点  该你了

393
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:32,074
怎么了?

394
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,029
那盏灯亮了多久了?

395
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:45,078
就是那个  对吧?   我们又错过了...

396
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:48,014
我们没错过

397
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,003
这次不是假警报了?

398
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:58,067
闭嘴  快去打电话

399
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:14,020
你好
Hello?

400
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,040
Widmore小姐么?
Ms. Widmore?

401
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,054
是的
Yes?

402
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:17,059
是我们
It's us.

403
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,069
我想我们找到了
I think we found it.

404
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:46,050
