Damn it.

17
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,094
Danielle

00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,065
还有多远?
How much further?

19
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,013
大约一小时
About an hour.

20
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,064
那个无线电塔 你上次去是什么时候?
The radio tower...when was the last time you were there?

21
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,090
我录下求救信号的那一天
The day I recorded the message.

22
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,017
我会带你去那个塔  但我不会离开这里的
I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.

23
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,001
什么?
What?

24
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,061
在那里我已经无家可归了
There's no place for me back there.

25
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:59,043
这里才是我的家
This is my home now.

26
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,013
你好 Jack
Hello Jack

27
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:26,042
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

28
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,050
Ben说了什么?
What did Ben say?

29
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,011
我们能杀他了吗?
Can we kill him?

30
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,040
怎么才能把这个关掉?
Is it possible to turn this equipment off?

31
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,044
什么?
What?

32
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:05,015
阻挠岛上信号的机器 你能关掉它吗?
The equipment that's jamming the island, can you turn it off?

33
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,037
当然  Ben给了我们密码
Sure. Ben gave us the code.

34
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,082
只有你们知道吗?
You are the only ones who have it?

35
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,027
是啊  怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

36
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,034
如果这个站被淹了会怎么样?
What would happen if the station were to be flooded?

37
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,023
不会怎么样
Nothing.

38
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,080
这些设备都是防水的
The casing for the equipment is waterproof.

39
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,013
它们会一直运行下去
It'll keep going forever.

40
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,043
那你们为什么在这里?
Then why do you need to be here?

41
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,029
因为这是Ben的命令
Because Ben told us to.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,048
我们只是服从命令
We were following orders.

43
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,081
你从来没有问过原因吗?
And you never asked why?

44
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,062
不  因为我相信他
No, because I trust him,

45
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,054
我相信Jacob
and I trust Jacob,

46
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:31,000
如果我质疑他的命令的话 这些事...
and the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing...

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,064
我们做的一切 都会前功尽弃
everything that we're doing here...falls apart.

48
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,090
她说的没错
She makes an excellent point.

49
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:01,024
不要!

50
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,003
求你了...
Please...

51
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,041
抱歉 Bonnie
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

52
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,038
我也只是服从命令
I, too, am following orders.

53
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:20,089
不  Des!  Des!

54
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,022
我们需要她
We need her.

55
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,010
我不认为我们还有功夫...
I don't believe we've had the pleasure...

56
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,064
别跟他说话!
Don't talk to him!

57
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,017
你想怎么样?
What do you want?

58
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,062
占用一下你的时间
Just a moment of your time...

59
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:01,017
我们两个单独谈谈
to talk, you and me, alone.

60
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,054
为什么?
For what?

61
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,032
你刚杀了我们七个人
You've just killed seven of my people.

62
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,081
你至少也能给我五分钟吧
The least you can give me is five minutes.

63
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,069
他是一个人吗?
Is he alone?

64
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:16,013
只有两个踪迹 他和她的
There's only two sets of tracks... his and hers.

65
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:26,034
就五分钟
Five minutes.

66
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:49,027
抱歉  先生 这张处方已经不能再配药了
I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.

67
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,074
一定是搞错了  我...
Well, that... That's a mistake.I...

68
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,071
我只领过两次
I only refilled it twice.

69
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,074
你能再帮我看下吗?
Could you check again?

70
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:00,053
我已经查过了  Shephard医生 你已经拿过3次药了
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,and that was the third refill,

71
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:03,033
我也无能为力
so there's nothing I can do.

72
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,044
我这里还有一张处方
Fine. I've got another prescription right here.

73
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,032
我认识你
Hey, I know you.

74
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,056
-你是那个英雄  -我才不是什么英雄
-You're the hero.  -I'm not a hero.

75
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,090
我们在电视上看到过
We saw it on TV.

76
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,094
女士  你怎么回事?
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

77
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,011
他要什么就给他吧 知道他做了什么吗?
Give this guy whatever he needs.You know what he did?

78
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,000
是这个...
Here, just... Here...

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,034
复方羟氢可待因
Oxycodone.

80
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,086
Shephard医生 你不能给自己开处方
Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.

81
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,051
这又不是给我的
That's not me.

82
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,035
是给Christian Shephard医生的
That's Dr.Christian Shephard.

83
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,059
我是Jack Shephard医生
I'm Dr.Jack Shephard.

84
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,050
他是我父亲
He's my father.

85
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,001
我得给你父亲办公室 打电话来确认一下
I'm gonna call his office to confirm...

86
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,006
他已经出城了
He's out of town right now.

87
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,059
办公室总有人...
I'm sure somebody in the office...

88
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,000
别麻烦了
Don't bother.

89

请坐
Have a seat.

90
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:04,001
Jack 不久前我做了个决定

00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,054
决定在一天内 夺走四十多个人的生命

92
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,054

93
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:17,014
这里  历史还会重演
history is about to repeat itself right here,right now.

94
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,074
我猜  你们...
Let me guess. You've...

95
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:22,077
已经包围了我们 如果我不照做的话  你们...
You've got us surrounded,and if I don't do what you say,

96
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,012

No, Jack.

98
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,040
是你
You are.

99
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,069
我怎么会呢?
And how am I gonna do that?

100
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:33,082
和你一起来的那个女人
The woman you're traveling with...

101
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:37,055
从直升机跳伞下来的那个女人
the one who parachuted onto the island from a helicopter...

102
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:41,003
她不是她所说的那个人
she's not who she says she is.

103
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,042
不是吗?
She's not, huh?

104
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,092
没错
No, she's not.

105
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:46,064
那她是谁?
Then who is she?

106
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:51,069
她代表想找到这座岛的人
She's a representative of some people who have been trying to find this island.

107
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:56,060
她是个坏人

我就会转过身去
I will turn around.

117

00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:28,097
我走我的阳关道
You will turn around,go back to your people.

119
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:31,074
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

120
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,032
-能把对讲机还给我吗?  -什么?
-May I have my walkie back?  -What?

121
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,086
有些东西你一定很想听
There's something you need to hear.

122
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,031

128
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:14,096
Jin  Sayid  Bernard 都在枪口上
Jin, Sayid, Bernard, at gunpoint.

129
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:17,008

130
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,038

131
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,071
我现在就掐断你的脖子...

Your father's dead. Your wife left you,moved on with another man.

我们不该往沙子里开抢
Instead of putting three bullets in the damn sand,

210
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,085
应该直接杀了他们

他们只有三个人和四把枪
