剧情回顾...

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,003
我们得带走那个男孩
We're taking the boy.

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:06,022
我不会给你任何人
I'm not giving you anybody.

4
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:08,012
爸爸
Dad.

5
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:12,013
Walt

6
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,071
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

7
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,052
你是说Kate?
You mean Kate?

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,092
Kate

9
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:41,061
Kate

10
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:47,061
看看这些
Look here and here.

11
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:51,058
你看在L5的位置 病毒正在腐蚀脊椎
You can see it's eroding into the spinal artery in the L5 area.

12
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:52,058
外加硬脑膜外的生长
Plus all this extradural growth.

13
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:56,076
我很诧异 居然没有引起持久性缺血
I'm surprised it hasn't caused permanent ischemia.

14
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:02,008
他说  你们没必要窃窃私语
He says you don't need to talk in whispers.

15
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,096
他知道没有治愈的机会了
He knows he doesn't have a chance.

16
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,085
你父亲很直率
Your father appreciates candour.

17
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:09,056
我们都是
We both do.

18
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:12,032
好吧  告诉他  真的很抱歉
Well, then tell him I'm very sorry,

19
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:17,040
但是我们不会给他进行手术
but he's not a candidate for surgery.

20
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,013
肿瘤位于脊柱上
The way the tumour is situated on the spine,

21
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:28,017
是不可能切除的
it's not possible to remove it.

22
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,029
他想知道你为什么不试一下
He wants to know why you won't try.

23
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:34,091
因为你父亲需要的
Because what your father is looking for

24
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:36,070
不是外科手术
is not a surgical procedure.

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,051
他需要的是奇迹
What he is looking for is a miracle.

26
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:53,039
他说"我并不是冲着你来的  先生
He said, "I did not come all this way for you, sir.

27
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,079
我是冲着他来的"
I came for him."

28
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:03,006
Busoni小姐...我...
Ms Busoni...I...

29
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:06,015
你曾治愈过一个脊柱粉碎的女人
You fixed a woman with a crushed spinal column.

30
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:07,061
一个不可能的手术
An impossible surgery.

31
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,056
她现在可以走路了吧?
And now she walks, yes?

32
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:12,070
在我来这之前 我参考过许多医学期刊
I consulted many medical journals before making this trip.

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,032
你要知道  那是完全不同的病例
Then you know it was a very different case

34
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,012
完全不一样的情况
under different circumstances.

35
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,059
是个奇迹  对吧?
But a miracle, right?

36
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,028
听着  我父亲说的每一句话
Look, Everything that my father's saying,

37
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:28,033
风险  不可能性  他说的一点没错
the risks, the unlikelihood, he's absolutely right.

38
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:33,095
但你是否愿意试一下?
But will you try?

39
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:53,077
接下来的几周我来安排
I'll have to admit him in the next couple of weeks,

40
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:58,005
给他做一些测试
run some tests.

没人能阻止我 知道吗?

那是我的权力  是一个父亲的权力

你真打算向我开枪 Micheal?
You gonna shoot me, Micheal?

54
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,076
不  但是我会打那台该死的电脑
No. But I'll shoot your damn computer.

55
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:20,013
事情不是你想的那样
That thing is not what you think it is anyway.

56
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,083
你不会明白的
You don't understand, man.

57
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,060
你不会知道的 现在马上进去
You don't have any idea. Now get in there.

没别的办法
No point changing the combination

74
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:25,080
除非你能从通风口钻出去
if you can get in through the air vent.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,026
真是好主意  John
That's really good thinking, John.

76

94
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:34,003
因为我不是你的护士
Because I'm not your nurse.

他用枪指着我
Held a gun on me,

123

把我们关在里面
put us both in there,

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,006
然后去找Walt了
and went after Walt.

125

你要干嘛?
What're you doing?

126
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,041

和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

128
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,049
你还需要抗生素
You're still on antibiotics.

129
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:25,069
那就更要跟着我的医生一起了
It's a good thing I'm travelling with my doctor then.

130
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,055
他怎么样?
How is he?

00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,002
那你应该找个更好的旅馆
I think you need to find a better hotel.

135
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:53,077
你还没回答我的问题
You didn't answer my question.

136
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:59,012
他的情况不是很乐观
His counts aren't where I'd like them to be.

137
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:02,046
你已经测试了一个月了 Jack
You've been doing tests for a month now, Jack.

138
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:06,045
我得很细心
I'm thorough.

139
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,001
坦白跟你讲
I have a confession to make.

140
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,066
我不相信奇迹
I don't believe in miracles.

141
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:28,036
对  也许我也不太相信
Yeah. Guess I'm not too sure about them, either.

142
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:33,022
我敢说你妻子并不这么认为
I bet your wife feels differently.

143
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:37,084
你妻子就是你治愈的那个女人  对吧?
Your wife, she is the woman you fixed, isn't she?

144
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:41,028
对
Yes.

145
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:44,088
我也很细心
I'm thorough, too.

146
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:52,014
她一定很特别 会允许你熬夜工作到凌晨4点30
She must be very special person to let you work until 4:30 in the morning.

147
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:54,074
我完全忘了时间了...
I completely lost track...

148
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:56,060
我得...我先走了行吗?
I gotta... Will you excuse me?

149
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,086
当然
Of course. Go.

150
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:03,023

我总要起床的
I gotta get up anyway.

158
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:39,042

So, how is he?

159
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:43,047
还是老样子
About the same.

160
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,059
Sarah  我很抱歉  我的意思是...
Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to...

161
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,097
我本来想...
I just got...

162
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,028
我...
I...

163
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:01,095
那是创造奇迹的代价
That's the price of being a miracle worker.

164
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,059
你要去哪?
Where you going?

165
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,065
我先去健身
I gotta go to the gym.

166
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:11,085
然后去改论文
Then I got some papers to grade.

167
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:32,025
在了解之前  我什么都不想说
I didn't wanna say anything until I knew either way,

168
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,041
但是...
but...

169
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:41,078
我的例假还没来  所以我做了验孕
I was late, so I got a pregnancy test.

170
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:53,028
别担心  没怀上
Don't worry. It was negative.

171
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,050
你...
Do you...

172
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,098
你想谈谈吗?
Do you wanna talk about it?

173
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:04,030
谈什么?
What's to talk about?

174
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,046
Sarah  我...
Sarah, I...

175
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:10,094
一会儿见  Jack
See you later, Jack.

176
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,007
怎么?
Well?

177
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,083
我不能说这绝对是Michael的
I can't say it's definitely Michael's,

178
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,057
但是看起来像他的鞋印
but it looks like his boot print.

179
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,067
这里也有一个
There's one over here, too.

180
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:29,020
看起来是他的踪迹
That sounds like a trail.

181
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,071
有枪给我吗?
You got a gun for me?

182
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,041
你别跟来
You're not coming.

183
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,004
-什么?    -你别跟来
-Excuse me?    -You're not coming.

184
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,019
得有人留下来管那个按键
Someone has to take care of the button.

185
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,037
那为什么是我? 
So, why should that person be me?

186
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,076
-我可以追踪  拿枪...  -你别跟来
-I can track, carry a gun...  -You're not coming.

187
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:42,070
你留下
You're staying.

188
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,019
可以么?
All right?

189
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,093
我们走
Let's go.

190
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:11,024
她对你怎么了?
What did she do to you?

191
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,038
什么?
What?

192
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:15,068
Kate  她做了什么?
Kate. What'd she do?

193
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,045
她什么都没做
She didn't do anything.

194
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,012
好吧  那你朝她大吼
Right. Yelling at her

195
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,048
就因为她想帮助找回Mike这件事很有意义?
because she wanted to help get Mike makes a lot of sense.

196
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:26,059
你为什么不回去 看看我是否伤了她的心?
Why don't you go back and see if I hurt her feelings?

197
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:27,092
我正想说呢
I'm just saying.

198
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:30,006
恩  我知道
Yeah, I know.

199
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,000
你爱她
You love her.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,088
你说什么?
What'd you say?

201
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,025
什么?
What?

202
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:42,062
是你回来的那条路么?
Does any of this look familiar from when you were coming back?

203
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,038
对  这是我最喜欢的叶子
Yeah. There's my favourite leaf.

204
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,062
我怎能忘记这地方?
How could I forget this place?

205
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:48,090
怎么了?
What's wrong?

206
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:55,024
当你们穿过这个岛 这边的海是哪个方向?
When you came across the island, what side was the ocean on?

207
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:03,032
你从东边来 Michael朝北走
You came from the east. Michael's heading north.

208
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,077
你到底要说什么?
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

209
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:10,006
就是说他不会回到你们来的那地方去
That means he's not going back to where you came from.

210
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:14,083
他往其他方向走了
He's heading somewhere else.

211
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,027
今天太阳很大

212
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,034
我不要帽子

213
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,046
我知道

214
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:35,097
戴着它

215
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:41,027
我觉得出事了

216
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,085
好啊  Hurley
Hello, Hurley.

217
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,007
帽子不错  伙计
Cool hat, dude.

218
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:54,020
Kate还好吧?
Is Kate all right?

219
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,051
呃..是呀
Uh...Yeah.

220
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,036
我猜Michael跑了
I guess Michael took off.

221
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:02,079
他说什么了?

222
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,024
你说什么  他跑了?
What do you mean, he took off?

223
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:07,013
他偷了一些枪独自出去了
He stole some guns and he went all commando.

224
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,047
据说他是去找Walt
Said he was going after Walt.

225
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:15,066
等会见  伙计  得去舱里了
Later, dudes. Gotta get to the hatch.

226
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,077
你在干嘛?

227
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,051
他说他们刚走

228
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:25,064
如果快的话我还能追上...

229
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,057
你哪里都不能去

230
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,053
别走

231
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,005
别离开我

232
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,065
当你还在竹筏上时...

233
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:38,037
知道我有多担心吗?

234
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,005
一想到你生死未卜

235
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:45,099
我都快要疯掉了

236
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:49,082
我不想再那样了

237
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:54,072
Micheal是我朋友

238
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:59,003
我是你妻子

239
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,093
医生
Doctor.

240
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:23,070
走慢点行吧?
You wanna slow down?

241
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,050
休息一会吧?
Take a break a minute?

242
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,033
好主意
Good idea.

243
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:34,068
他还在往北走?
He still heading north?

244
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,013
对
Yep.

245
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,097
你觉得他迷路了?
You think he's lost?

246
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,061
不会
Doesn't seem to be.

247
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:42,014
足迹像公路一样笔直
Trail's as straight as the interstate.

248
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:47,013
是一个有方向感的人走的路
The path of a man who knows where he's going.

249
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:50,070
你要怎么做  Jack?
Where are you going, Jack?

250
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,066
什么?
What?

251
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:55,011
如果我们赶上了Micheal
Let's say we catch up with him, Micheal.

252
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,068
你要怎么做?
What are you gonna do?

253
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,047
我要把他带回来
I'm gonna bring him back.

254
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:02,038
万一他不想回来呢?
What if he doesn't wanna come back?

255
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,082
我会说服他回来
I'll talk him into coming back.

256
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:08,009
这是他第二次去找Walt  而且把我打晕了
This is the second time he's gone after Walt. He knocked me out.

257
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,009
他把我们都关起来了
He locked us both up.

258
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:14,034
直觉告诉我他不会听你说理
Something tells me he might be past listening to reason.

259
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,024
什么  你觉得我们应该随他去
What, you think we should just let him go?

260
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,010
不管他了?
Write him off?

261
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:26,010
我们有什么资格去告诉别人该做什么不该做什么?
Who are we to tell anyone what they can or can't do?

262
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,064
现在回去还来得及
It's not too late to go back.

263
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,077
瘤在扩散
The tumour's aggressive,

264
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:44,025
但是你父亲还可以 正常生活至少一年
but your father could lead a normal life for at least another year.

265
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:50,015
回去? 回哪里? 家?
Go back? Go back where? Home?

266
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,096
你改变主意了吗  Jack?
Have you changed your mind, Jack?

267
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:57,004
不  不
No. No.

268
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,065
这就行了?
Is that it?

269
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:17,006
即使你没成功
Even if you don't succeed,

270
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:20,069
至少给了我们机会
you're giving us a chance.

271
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:25,040
我们不敢奢望什么
That's all we wanted.

272
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:30,030
手术前  我还会出来跟你确认一下
I'll come out and check on you before I scrub in.

273
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,090
好的
Okay.

274
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:39,005
我妨碍你们说话了吗?
Am I interrupting?

275
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:44,003
没  我正准备走
No, I was just leaving.

276
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,016
明早见
I'll see you in the morning.

277
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:52,053
明早见
I'll see you in the morning.

278
00:18:56,047 --> 00:19:03,013
检查报告要你签字
I.T.R. reports need to be signed by you as chief resident.

279
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:08,054
什么?
What?

280
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:12,010
小心
Careful.

281
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,033
做事要有限度 儿子 你知道的
There's a line, Son. You know it's there.

282
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,097
如果超过了限度...
Pretending it's not

283
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:22,044
就会酿成大错
that would be a mistake.

284
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:27,045
我猜你应该知道
Guess you would know.

285
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,052
对一些人来说可能没问题  Jack
It may be okay for some people, Jack

286
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:37,018
但你不是
but not for you.

287
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:05,000
确定Mike往这里走?
You sure Mike went this way?

288
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,054
为什么这样问?
Why do you ask?

289
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,057
我不知道  清道夫先生
I don't know, Mr Clean.

290
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:13,082
或许我应该去爬维苏威山
I probably would have gone around Mount Vesuvius.

291
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:18,018
你为什么选那个名字?
Why'd you pick that name?

292
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,018
不明显吗?
Ain't it obvious?

293
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:25,017
再加上耳环和拖把就行了
All you need's an earring and a mop.

294
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,084
不 你的名字 为什么选名叫"Sawyer"?
No. Your name. Why did you pick Sawyer?

295
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,037
什么叫"选"?
What do you mean, "pick"?

296
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:35,092
在人员调查后  Hurley给了我旅客名单
After the census, Hurley gave me the flight manifest.

297
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:38,019
你叫James  对吧?
Your name is James, right?

298
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,068
James Ford

299
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:43,015
那又怎样?
What's it to you?

300
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:46,020
真是选了个有趣的名字
Just an interesting name to choose, is all.

301
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,012
从谁那里参考来的?
Who'd you get it from?

302
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:52,071
谁说我的名字是从别人那里来的?
Who says I got it from anybody?

303
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,018
Michael

304
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,033
Jack  蹲下
Jack, get down.

305
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,009
-Michael    -Jack!

306
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:05,054
Jack

307
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,082
Michael

308
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,091
Michael

309
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:27,007
Jack

310
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:30,036
什么?
What?

311
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,051
他就在附近
He's close.

312
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,092
对 如果他都朝某人开枪了 你还想他会回来?
Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone. You want them coming back?

313
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,056
对我来说 是的
Personally, hell, yeah.

314
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,089
你说这些人两天前穿过这个岛
You said these people were two days away across the island.

315
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,061
对  他们从我们营地不到一公里处带走了Cindy
Yeah, and they took Cindy less than a mile from our camp.

316
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:45,045
过来看看
Over here.

317
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:50,002
空弹壳
Shell casings.

318
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:52,029
-几发?  -3发  Michael的
-How many?   -Three. Michael's.

319
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:55,056
你们聋了?  我听到至少7声
You boys deaf? I heard at least seven shots.

320
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,078
你也听到了对吧 Daniel Boone  你听到几声?
You heard them, Daniel Boone. What's your count?

321
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:01,050
对  差不多7声
Yeah. Seven sounds about right.

322
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,032
天快黑了
It's getting dark.

323
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:07,055
Mike会往哪去?
Which way did Mike go?

324
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:18,093
怎么了?
What?

325
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:21,035
你出来是找Michael
You out here for Michael,

326
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:24,069
还是为了来报复那次枪击?
or just payback for getting shot?

327
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:29,035
那你来这儿干嘛?
Why are you out here, Doctor?

328
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:31,055
你有你的想法
You got your reasons,

329
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:37,013
我也有我的
and I got mine.

330
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:48,009
Jack

331
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,039
-我都快成功了  -我知道  孩子
-I had it.  -I know, Son.

332
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,065
要成了  要成了  都快成功了
I got it! I got it all. I mean, I had it!

333
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:58,006
他是个生病的老人 已经在台上躺了7个半小时了
He was a sick old man on a table for seven and a half hours.

334
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:03,056
他心脏不跳了  这不是谁的错
His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.

335
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,096
必须告诉她
I've got to go tell her.

336
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:14,000
是的 我已经说了
Yeah, well, I've already done that.

337
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:20,095
免得你忘记  我还是外科主任
Lest you forget, I am still chief of surgery.

338
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:24,023
她在哪?
Where is she?

339
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:28,084
-也许你该回家去  -她在哪?
-Maybe you should go home.  -Where is she?

340
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:34,082
她走了
She's gone.

341
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:38,003
Jack...

342
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:42,097
回家去吧
Go home.

343
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,095
Jack?

344
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:12,099
Gabriela

345
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:20,081
我父亲告诉我 你已经走了
My father told me that you'd gone.

346
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,022
-我 呃...    -谢谢
-I, uh...   -Thank you.

347
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:30,068
感谢你的尝试
Thank you for trying.

348
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:33,031
Gabriela...

349
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:37,038
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

350
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:49,085
很抱歉  很抱歉我没能...
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

351
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:04,002
没事的
It's okay.

352
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,073
我...
I...

353
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:10,066
我...
I'm...

354
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:16,057
我不能这样
I can't.

355
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:26,088
你说什么?  你跟丢了?
What do you mean, you lost it?

356
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:30,023
他是人  不是野猪  他要更狡猾一些
He's a man, not a boar. His sign's more subtle.

357
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,054
我需要灯光指引
I need light to follow him.

358
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,073
给你
Here.

359
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:38,016
火把
Light.

360
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:39,091
-我觉得最好还是回去    -什么?
-I think we'd better head back.  -What?

361
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,096
去找踪迹  John
Just find the trail, John.

362
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,016
-我找不到线索了    -你不是找不到
-I've lost the trail.    -You don't just lose a trail.

363
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:46,031
你是不想找他
You just don't want to find him.

364
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,005
对  说得对  Jack
Yeah, that's right, Jack.

365
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,062
我顺着枪声穿越丛林
I've been running through the jungle toward the sound of gunfire

366
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:54,051
而我不在乎Micheal
because I don't care about Michael.

367
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,069
别想改变我的想法  John
Don't turn around on me, John.

368
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:57,053
你不会把他带回去的 你自己很清楚
You won't get him to come back, and you know it!

369
00:25:57,053 --> 00:26:00,044
如果我们回去会发生什么?
You know what happens if we just turn around and go back?

370
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,062
我们就再也见不到他了
We're never gonna see him again.

371
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,040
这取决于我们...
And that's gonna be on us...

372
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,039
取决于你和我
On you and on me.

373
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,088
你说的很对  Jack
You're exactly right, Jack.

374
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:15,039
但是如果我是你
But if I were you,

375
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,013
我会听Locke先生的
I'd listen to Mr Locke.

376
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:32,044
你是谁?
Who are you?

377
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:36,018
在竹筏上朝我开枪的那个婊子养的
He's the son of a bitch that shot me on the raft.

378
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:40,036
为什么不把枪放下?
Why don't you point the gun down?

379
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:54,012
也许你们最好把两手放好
Probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

380
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,031
Michael在哪?
Where's Michael?

381
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,027
别担心Michael
Don't worry about Michael.

382
00:26:57,027 --> 00:27:00,080
他不会找到我们的
He's not gonna find us.

383
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,064
你想怎样?
What do you want?

384
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:07,030
为什么不生火呢  John?
Why don't you build us a fire, John?

385
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:13,027
是时候我们谈谈了
I think it's time we all had a talk.

386
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:24,059
Geronimo Jackson?
Geronimo Jackson?

387
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,078
恩
Huh.

388
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:31,044
作为一个音乐方面的行家
As an expert in all things musical,

389
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:34,046
我从没听说过这些家伙  真不应该
I never heard of these guys, shocking as that may be.

390
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,046
Geronimo Jackson
Geronimo Jackson?

391
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,008
这个看起来不错
This looks sweet.

392
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:39,011
我们听听吧
Let's give her a rip.

393
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:42,053
好
Yeah.

394
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:48,026
你觉得那个Libby背后发生过什么故事?
So, what do you think is the story with that Libby chick?

395
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:49,083
故事?
The story?

396
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:52,065
她挺可爱的  是吧?
She's kind of cute, right?

397
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:57,058
你知道就是"我被其他人恐吓了40天"的那种
You know, in a "I've been terrorized by the Others for 40 days" kind of way.

398
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:02,067
是啊  是的
Yeah, there is that.

399
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:07,071
我觉得我跟她有希望
I think I have a chance with her.

400
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:10,013
我说  这是个经典的以荒岛为背景的故事
I mean, it's the classic desert-island scenario.

401
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:11,072
如果让我选
If I ever had a shot,

402
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:15,071
就选这个
this is it.

403
00:28:17,004 --> 00:28:20,017
你觉得Claire已经开始想我了么?
You think Claire's missed me yet?

404
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:25,057
伙计  都烦了一天了
Dude, it's been a day.

405
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,081
这音乐很郁闷
This music is quite depressing.

406
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,032
我们可以换一张  伙计
We can change it, dude.

407
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:38,032
你听过Geronimo Jackson么?
You ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?

408
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:41,010
恐怕没有 Jack和Locke去哪儿了?
I'm afraid not. Where is Jack and Locke?

409
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,061
他们去找Michael了
They went after Michael.

410
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:46,014
-Michael?  -是啊  他又去找Walt了
-Michael?  -Yeah, he's run after Walt again.

411
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:48,021
大家都去了想把他找回来
Everyone's gone to bring him back.

412
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,044
大家指谁?
Who's everyone?

413
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:52,082
大家是Jack  Sawyer  Locke
Everyone...Jack, Sawyer, Locke.

414
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:56,057
还有Kate
And Kate.

415
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,075
坐下  Jack  没人会伤害你的
Just sit down, Jack. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

416
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:04,055
我为了和平而来
I come in peace.

417
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:07,019
你怎么知道我们的名字?
How do you know our names?

418
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:10,023
你带走了Walt
You took Walt.

419
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:12,024
Walt很好
Walt's fine.

420
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:14,059
他是个很特别的孩子
He's a very special boy.

421
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,069
听着  你说过你想谈谈
Look, you said you wanted to talk.

422
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,091
那就谈谈
Talk.

423
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:23,037
让我问问你 你来到这个岛上多久了?
Let me ask you this, how long you been here on the island?

424
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,083
50天
Fifty days.

425
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:30,032
50天  都快两个月了
Fifty days? That's, what almost two whole months.

426
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:31,081
告诉我
Tell me,

427
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:35,059
你第一次去别人家时
you go over a man's house for the first time,

428
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:38,031
你会脱掉鞋子吗
do you take off your shoes?

429
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:41,085
你会把脚搁在他的咖啡桌上吗
Do you put your feet up on his coffee table,

430
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:45,059
你会走进厨房  吃不属于你的食物
do you walk in the kitchen, eat food that doesn't belong to you,

431
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:51,046
你会打开你无权打开的门  闯进他人房间吗?
open the door to rooms you got no business opening?

432
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:55,063
你知道 有位比在坐各位都聪明的人说过
You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said,

433
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:58,044
"人类自诞生之日起
"Since the dawn of our species,

434
00:29:58,044 --> 00:30:03,004
就被赋予了好奇之心"
man has been blessed with curiosity."

435
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:09,003
你知道另一个关于好奇心的事吗  Jack?
You know the other one about curiosity, don't you, Jack?

436
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:12,021
这不是你们的岛
This is not your island.

437
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:14,058
这是我们的岛
This is our island.

438
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:17,012
你们之所以能生存下来
And the only reason you're living on it

439
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:22,035
是因为我们让你们生存
is because we let you live on it.

440
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:28,031
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

441
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,070
你不相信什么?
You don't believe what?

442
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,066
我认为你们只有一个人一把枪
I think you got one guy with a gun.

443
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:36,099
我认为我们的人比你的人多
I think there's more of us than there are of you.

444
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,058
我认为你如果真有实力
I think if you had any real strength,

445
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,045
你就不用派间谍了
you wouldn't have had to send a spy.

446
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:48,045
Ethan

447
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,083
这是个有趣的理论
That's an interesting theory.

448
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:57,050
点火
Light them up.

449
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:01,044
我们有些误会  Jack...
We got a misunderstanding, Jack...

450
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:03,096
你的人  我的人
Your people, my people.

451
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,018
所以听好了
So listen carefully.

452
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:09,085
这儿有条线
Right here, there's a line.

453
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,076
一旦你跨过了这条线
You cross that line,

454
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:14,047
我们将会从误会升级到
we go from misunderstanding to

455
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:17,061
更可怕的程度
something else.

456
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:20,074
现在把你的武器给我  回去吧
Now give me your weapons, turn around,

457
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:23,002
回你们那儿去
and go home.

458
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:25,061
不
No.

459
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:30,001
-Jack  或许...  -不
-Jack, maybe...  -No!

460
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:33,042
我本不希望这样
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

461
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:38,011
把她带出来  Alex
Bring her out, Alex.

462
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:43,015
她跟着你们
She was following you.

463
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,079
就像我说的...
Like I said...

464
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,068
好奇心的事
curiosity.

465
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:54,006
别动
Don't.

466
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:59,089
Jack  你现在要做出决定
Jack, the decision you gotta make right now is this.

467
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:05,029
你是眼睁睁看着我当你面打死这个女人
Can you live with the fact that I shot this woman right in front of you,

468
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:11,008
还是为救她 放弃掉 转身回去
and you could've saved her life by giving up and going home?

469
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,020
现在把你的枪给我
Now you gonna give me your guns,

470
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,087
回你们的地方去
turn around, and walk away.

471
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:19,017
全凭你的主意  Jack
It's your call, Jack.

472
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:24,075
-要是你动她一根指头我就...  -闭嘴
-If you touched a hair on her head, I'll...  -Shut up.

473
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:29,028
我数三下
I'm going to count to three.

474
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:33,017
一
