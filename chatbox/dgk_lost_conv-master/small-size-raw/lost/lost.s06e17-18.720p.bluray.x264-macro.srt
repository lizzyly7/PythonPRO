1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,350
"迷失" 前情提要...
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,950
你还记得你初来这里
You remember that bamboo field you woke up in

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,220
醒来时所在的那个竹林吗? 穿过那片竹林 再跨过一座桥
when you first got here? Beyond that field, across a ridge,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,850
就是岛的心脏地带了 光就在那儿
is the heart of the island. That's where the light is.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,300
那儿也是他的目的地
That's where he's trying to go,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,930
- 所以你必须去保护它  - 我得保护多久?
- And that's what you have to protect.  - How long am I gonna have to do this job?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,150
直到生命的终点 喝了这个 你就跟我一样了
As long as you can. Drink this. Now you're like me.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,130
- Desmond Hume就是被我扔进这口井里去的  - 啊!
- This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.  - Aah!

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,650
- 貌似有人帮他逃了出来  - 不 Ben 是有人帮忙把我弄了出来
- Looks like someone helped him out.  - No, Ben, someone helped me out.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,800
我要找到Desmond
I'm gonna find Desmond.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,230
等我找到他后 我就毁了这个岛
And when I do, I'm gonna destroy the island.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,370
前几天有一场交通肇事逃逸事故
There was a hit-and-run a few days ago

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,840
地点是华盛顿Tustin中学
at Washington Tustin high school.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,990
- 然后?  - 我就是嫌犯
- Yeah?  - I'm the suspect.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,330
下午好 你今天过得如何?
Good afternoon. And how are you doing today?

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,650
再好不过了
Terrific.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,690
是时候走人了
I think it's time to leave.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,370
你跟着他 你跟着我
You're with him, and you're with me.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,490
我们去听音乐会
We are going to a concert.

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,490
走吧
Let's go.

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,320

大洋航空

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,720

大洋航空

23
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,880

大洋航空

24
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,590

遗体

25
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,940
- 需要人签收么?  - 你是这里的员工?
- Do you need somebody to sign for that?  - You work here?

26
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,510
如假包换 伙计
I do indeed, brother.

27
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,270
你是牧师 还是其他啥的?
You a priest or somethin'?

28
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,490
我不是牧师
Or something.

29
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,380
介意把东西运到那后面去么?
Do you mind taking it around the back there?

30
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,150
没问题 我这就运过去
Yeah, sure. You got it.

31
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,010
运到那边就好 谢谢
Just around there. Thank you.

32
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,580
谁去世了?
Who died?

33
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,770
一个名叫Christian Shephard的男子
A man named Christian Shephard.

34
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,220
"Christian Shephard"吗?
"Christian Shephard"?

35
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,260
真的?
Seriously?

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,710
真的
Seriously.

37
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,520
你朋友?
Friend of yours?

38
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,840
不算吧
Not exactly.

39
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,190
等... 等会儿
H... hang on a second.

40
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,590
你带我越狱 让我穿上这件礼服
You bust me out of jail and make me put on this dress

41
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,050
说咱俩要去啥音乐会
so that we can go to some concert,

42
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,070
可你竟连我们来这儿的原因 都不告诉我?
and you won't even tell me why we're here?

43
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,760
没人能告诉你到这儿来的理由 Kate
No one can tell you why you're here, Kate.

44
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,730
- 总之我没办法告诉你  - 是你带我来的啊
- Certainly not me.  - You're the one who brought me here.

45
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,220
我说的不是教堂
I'm not talking about the church.

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,200
我是说尘世
I'm talking about here.

47
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,190
你是谁?
Who are you?

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,490
你想干嘛?
What do you want?

49
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,310
我叫Desmond Hume
My name is Desmond Hume.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,510
甚至你可能都没意识到 我是你的朋友
And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend.

51
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,160
至于我想干嘛...
And as for what I want...

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
我不过是想离开
I want to leave.

53
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,700
离开去哪儿?
Leave and go where?

54
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,160
我带你去看
Let me show you.

55
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,090
你没事吧?
You okay?

56
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,960
嗯
Yeah.

57
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,070
你呢?
You?

58
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,560
说实话 医生 我想知道
Well, to be honest, doc, I'm kinda wondering

59
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,710
刚刚到底发生了什么事
what the hell just happened up here.

60
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,870
我也想知道呢
That makes two of us.

61
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,860
那你现在是新任Jacob 对么?
So you're the new Jacob, huh?

62
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,760
感觉有啥不同?
Feel any different?

63
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,300
没啥感觉
Not really.

64
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,600
医生 不如你下山
Well, doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop

65
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,830
告诉我们 林子失火
and tell us what the hell the burning bush

66
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,960
意味着什么?
had to say for itself?

67
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,690
Jacob告诉我 我们得去旧营地的
Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest

68
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,660
竹林
out past our old camp.

69
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,400
穿过竹林
Just past it, well,

70
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,160
他说 我们就可以找到要保护的地方
he said I'd find the place that we need to protect.

71
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,990
那里... 到底是个什么样的地方?
This place... what is it?

72
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,750
他说 它是岛的心脏
He called it the heart of the island.

73
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,870
他说 所谓的心脏...
All he said was that it's...

74
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,710
就是光
it's a light.

75
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,900
而且扮成Locke的烟怪想要扑灭它?
And that Locke smoke thing wants to put it out?

76
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,660
嗯 差不多吧
Something like that, yeah.

77
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,130
如果他把光灭了呢?
So what if he does?

78
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,380
那我们就玩完了
Then that's it for all of us.

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,080
但... 如果Locke意在扑灭它 他为啥不去灭?
But... but if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?

80
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,590
因为他还缺点儿什么
'Cause he ain't got what he needs.

81
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,470
我猜 他缺的是Desmond
I'm guessing that'd be Desmond.

82
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,000
所以在你就职之前 这就是我们的目标
That's where we were headed before your inauguration.

83
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,890
Sayid说过 Locke把他扔进了一口井
Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.

84
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,210
Jacob没跟我说过任何关于Desmond的事
Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond.

85
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,000
他似乎什么也没说过啊
Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything.

86
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,060
这倒是真的 他表现得真不像个智者
That's kinda true, dude. He's worse than Yoda.

87
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,740
好吧 你们都去岛的心脏地带
All right, y'all head to your heart of the island,

88
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,090
我去抓逃出井的小妖
and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.

89
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,660
如果我们留下路标 你追得上来么?
If we leave a trail, can you catch up with us?

90
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,750
- 嗯 没问题  - 注意安全
- Hell, yeah, I can.  - Then be safe.

91
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,990
我本想叫你一起去的 不过如果又告诉你
I'd ask you along, but that'd take all the fun

92
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,080
- 你不能去 那才叫扫兴  - 呃 我看
- out of me telling you you can't come.  - Uh, I guess

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,420
我得拼命克制跟你同去的念头了
I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.

94
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
我有种不祥的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:16,720

迷失 第6季第17-18集

96
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,850
我不知道你干嘛带我越狱
I don't know why you got me out of prison,

97
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,280
也不知道你的目的和身份
what you want or who you are,

98
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,550
但你应该知道 我担不起责任...
but you understand I can't be held responsible for...

99
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,300
嗯 嗯 我都明白 兄弟
Yeah, yeah, whatever, dude.

100
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,080
看见这东西 能想起来啥不?
None of this is ringing a bell, is it?

101
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,020
你 我... 麻醉枪?
You, me... tranquilizer gun?

102
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,640
你神经病啊
You are insane.

103
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,510
好吧 我神经病 你好生在这儿待着
Okay. Fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.

104
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,840
要是我不呢?
What if I don't?

105
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,210
随你的便
Then that's your choice.

106
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,020
但如果你选择继续跟着我...
But if you stick with me...

107
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,340
有朝一日 你会无比庆幸
you'll be happy you did.

108
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,440
来了 来了 来了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,710
我明明挂了"请勿打扰"的标志
"Do no disturb" sign.

110
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,810
你是谁?
Who are you?

111
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,110
你干嘛笑得像个傻子?
Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?

112
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
呃 你今晚有场音乐会要出演
Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight,

113
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,650
我是来接你的
and I'm here to pick you up.

114
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,880
我对Widmore的另一个白痴 说得不够清楚么?
Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey?

115
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,360
我才不在乎什么破音乐会
I don't care about a sodding concert.

116
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,820
Charlie啊...
Charlie...

117
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,730
Charlie 如果我告诉你...
Charlie, what if I told you that...

118
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,160
出演这场音乐会
playing this show is

119
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,790
将是你人生中最重要的一件事呢?
the most important thing you'll ever do?

120
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,300
你会去么?
Would you come then?

121
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,820
滚
Sod off.

122
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,020
好吧 兄弟 抱歉了
Okay, dude. Sorry about this.

123
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,640
那是啥?
What was that?

124
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,860
Charlie呗
That was Charlie.

125
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,430
你为什么要接手这工作 Jack?
Why did you take the job, Jack?

126
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,390
因为我应该接手
Because I was supposed to.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,530
为什么? 就因为有个陌生人 把我们的名字写在了墙上?
Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?

128
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,140
我会接手 是因为这个岛是我的唯一
I took it because the island's all I've got left.

129
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,720
它是我这一生 唯一一个我不想毁掉的东西
It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin.

130
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,120
你什么都没毁啊
You haven't ruined anything.

131
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,100
没有什么是不可挽回的
Nothing is irreversible.

132
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,890
如果我们不是都得死的话 这话听着还真叫人舒心
This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.

133
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,580
既然你都在旁看着了 那干嘛不一起玩玩?
As long as you're watching, why don't you join us?

134
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,410
你到这儿来干嘛 James?
What are you doing here, James?

135
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,470
我听说Desmond落井了
I heard Desmond fell in the well,

136
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,980
所以我来帮忙拉他出来
so I came to help him get out.

137
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,170
看来有人已经抢先我们一步 把他救走了
Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch.

138
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,600
哦 真好
Oh, well.

139
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,530
你知道我干嘛到这儿来吗?
Do you know why I'm here?

140
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,410
我猜 你是因为需要Desmond来毁了这个岛
I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island.

141
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,400
答得真准
That's absolutely right.

142
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,770
然后呢 烟怪? 和船一起沉了?
Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship?

143
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,750
自杀貌似不符合你的风格
Suicide doesn't seem like your style.

144
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,470
我不会死的
I'm not going down with anything.

145
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,020
但你和剩下的那些Jacob的小"候选人"
But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates"

146
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,240
绝对会死
absolutely are.

147
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,350
我们不再是候选人了
We're not candidates anymore.

148
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:20,970
哦! 哦!
Ohh! Oh!

149
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,980
啊
Aah.

150
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,030
再见啦
I'll be seein' ya.

151
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
你不去追他?
You're not gonna go after him?

152
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,820
不需要
I don't need to.

153
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,840
当你说 你要毁了这个岛的时候
When you said you were gonna destroy the island,

154
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,770
我还以为你是在打比方
I thought you were speaking figuratively.

155
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,170
就因为我曾经说过 等我走了 一切由你接管?
Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone?

156
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,930
如果我弄沉了这个岛
I'm sorry if I left out the part

157
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,860
那我得说声抱歉
about the island being on the bottom of the ocean.

158
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,780
换句话说 欢迎你和我一起坐船走
That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat.

159
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,300
因为我们一旦驱使Desmond 做了我们要他做的事
Because once we get Desmond to do what we need him to do,

160
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,650
我就坐船离开这个蛮荒之地
I'm gonna sail away from this godforsaken place

161
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,070
还要亲眼看着它沉没
and watch it sink.

162
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,330
之前有条狗来过这儿
I think there was a dog here.

163
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,510
早上好
Morning.

164
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,920
早上好
Morning.

165
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,490
睡得好么?
Sleep okay?

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,300
嗯
Aye.

167
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,660
你的帐篷比井底舒服多了
Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,950
我想我该把这当成是一种赞美
I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.

169
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,110
你是要继续对着他喋喋不休
Are you gonna talk his ear off,

170
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,900
还是去给他拿点儿早餐?
or you gonna get the man some breakfast?

171
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,650
我去看看捕鱼机
Guess I'll go check the traps for fish.

172
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,020
走吧 Vincent
Come on. Vincent.

173
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,680
我们走
Let's go.

174
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,080
呃 Rose 跟我说说...
So, Rose, tell me...

175
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,190
你俩在这儿住了多久?
how long have the two of you been living here?

176
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,510
我们75年盖的房子
Well, we built this place in '75,

177
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,460
然后... 住了几年
and... lived here a couple of years,

178
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,640
再然后 一切好转了
and then the sky lit up again.

179
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,670
现在只有上帝知道 我们何时进地狱了
So God only knows when in the hell we are now.

180
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,720
所以... Desmond...
So... Desmond...

181
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,960
我无心冒犯
I don't mean to be rude,

182
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,170
但等你用餐完毕 我想请你离开
but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on.

183
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,580
我们为你破了例
We broke our rule with you.

184
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,960
破了什么例
What rule is that?

185
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,530
我们不会参与其中
We don't get involved.

186
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,940
不管是什么东西把你丢进井里的...
Whatever got you tossed inside a well...

187
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,040
那都是我和Bernard
That's the kind of drama

188
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,470
不愿蹚的浑水
Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with.

189
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,330
这没错
Fair enough.

190
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,370
看来你捕到鱼了
Looks like you caught something.

191
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,170
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,250
你好 Rose
Hello, Rose.

193
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,040
直奔主题吧
I'll make this simple.

194
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,040
要么你现在跟我走
Come with me now

195
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,500
要么我就当着你的面 杀了他们
or I'll kill them both right in front of you.

196
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,010
你哪里都不用跟他去
You don't have to go anywhere with him.

197
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,300
我会让他们受尽痛苦
I'll make it hurt.

198
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,480
我要你保证
I want your word.

199
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,520
不动他们
You won't touch them.

200
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,700
- 永远不动  - 一言为定
- Ever.  - Done.

201
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,530
那我悉听尊便
Then I'll do what you want.

202
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,090
好 Desmond
Yes, Desmond.

203
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,820
听话就好
You will.

204
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,558
Desmond 你知道我要带你去哪儿吗?
You have any idea where I'm taking you, Desmond?

205
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:08,948
不知道
No.

206
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,748
但我猜你要带我去个非常亮堂的地方
But I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light.

207
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,198
何以见得?
What makes you say that?

208
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,628
哦... 直觉
Oh... just a hunch.

209
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,498
- 什么响?  - 什么?
- What was that?  - What was what?

210
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:41,848
Linus 能听见我吗? 快回话
Linus, can you hear me? Come in.

211
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:44,968
我找到了Alpert
I found Alpert.

212
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,058
Linus啊
Linus?

213
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:50,138
该死
Damn it.

214
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,268
你没事吧?
You okay?

215
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,708
怎... 怎... 怎么了?
What... what... what happened?

216
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,598
你以为跟
You thought it'd be a good idea

217
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,788
黑烟谈谈行得通
to talk to the black smoke.

218
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,498
可结果它把你扔进了该死的丛林
It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.

219
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,908
Locke 啊...
Locke. L...

220
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,448
- 他在吗?  - 不在
- Is he still here?  - No.

221
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:11,698
来
Here.

222
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,888
我想用对讲机联系Linus
I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie.

223
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:14,728
可他一直没接
He won't pick up.

224
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,768
- 来 我们找人帮帮忙  - 帮忙? 帮忙? 找谁?
- Come on. Let's get you some help.  - Help? Help? Help from where?

225
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,128
炸弹没丢吧? 我是说... C4炸弹?
You still have the explosives? The... the C-4?

226
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,538
没丢 怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

227
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:24,918
我们要去另一个岛
Because we need to go to the other island

228
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,518
将我们所做的一切来个了结 炸了那架飞机
and finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane.

229
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:57,978
- Ford探员  - Jim 是我
- Detective Ford.  - Jim, it's me.

230
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,928
- 我想我刚看见了那个叫Jarrah的家伙  - 你在区监狱?
- I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.  - You at County Lockup?

231
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,048
不是 我在我父亲的博物馆义演音乐会
No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing.

232
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,238
那不可能是Jarrah
Well, it can't be Jarrah.

233
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:07,678
- 一小时前 我刚把他送上去区监狱的车  - 你确定?
- I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.  - Really?

234
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:10,678
- 我刚打过电话 他们说车根本没到  - 什么?
- Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.  - What?

235
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:11,738
Jim 帮帮我
Help me out here, Jim.

236
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,708
Jarrah冷血地枪击了四个人
Jarrah popped four people in cold blood.

237
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:16,098
只有一名受害者生还 没错吧?
Only one witness left the scene alive, right?

238
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:19,778
- 貌似是个韩国女人 你能保证她的安全吗?  - 对 没错 Sun Paik
- Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay?  - Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik.

239
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:22,198
受了枪伤 还在医院
Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital.

240
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,078
Enos 好好欣赏音乐会吧 我会保护她
Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe.

241
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:32,728

感觉怎么样

242
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:35,678

有点儿疼

243
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,338

中枪了当然会疼

244
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,188

医生会来给宝宝做检查

245
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:48,038

如果一切都好的话

246
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,978

他们说我们马上就可以出院

247
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:51,398

离开?

248
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:56,828

然后一直躲着我父亲?

249
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:01,368
我打扰到你们了吗?
Am I interrupting?

250
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:09,198
嗨 Paik夫人 我是Juliet Carlson
Hi. Ms. Paik, I'm Juliet Carlson.

我是来给你的宝宝做检查的
I'm here to make sure your baby's okay.

252
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,328

You must be the daddy.

253
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:21,108
抱歉 你们不会说英语
I'm sorry. You don't speak English.

254
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:23,948
我... 我尽量少说话
I'm.... I'll try not to talk too much.

255
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,918
好的 把外衣卷起一点儿
Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit.

256
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,388
会有些凉
It's a little cold.

257
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,918
好了 我们看看
Okay. Let's take a look.

258
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:09,438
没事吧?
Okay?

259
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:10,998

你没事吧?

260
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:14,738

我...

261
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,498

想起来了

262
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:17,738

想起什么了?

263
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:20,668
在这儿
There it is.

264
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,278
你们的孩子
There's your baby.

265
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,008

你看见了吗?

266
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,078
看见那个小小的摆动吗?
Do you see that little flutter?

267
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:12,578
那儿?
Right there?

268
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,828
那是宝宝的心跳
That's the baby's heartbeat.

269
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,388
一切非常正常
Perfectly perfect in every way.

270
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:28,768
羊水诊断有结果了 各项都检查好了
I have your amnio results. Everything checked out.

271
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,008
想知道是男孩儿 还是女孩儿吗?
Would you like to know if it's a boy or a girl?

272
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:33,408
是女孩儿
It's a girl.

273
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,158
没错
Yeah.

274
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,858
她叫Jin Yeon
Her name is Jin Yeon.

275
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,488
好可爱的名字
That's a lovely name.

276
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:44,778
顺便提一下 你们俩英文说得不赖
And for the record, y... you two speak English just fine.

277
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:47,008
恭喜了
Congratulations.

278
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,990
哇哦! 大脚 别紧张 是我
Whoa! Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me.

279
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,660
我找到Locke了
I found Locke.

280
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,290
那混蛋说要毁了这个岛
Son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island.

281
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,940
你说得没错 医生
You had it right, doc.

282
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,200
好消息是 Desmond逃出了那口井
Good news is, Desmond got out of that well,

283
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,620
- 所以 如果我们可以在黑烟之前找到他...  - James 谁找到Desmond都无所谓了
- so if we can find him before Smokey can...  - It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James.

284
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,470
反正都是殊途同归
We're all going to the same place anyway.

285
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,060
然后呢?
Then what?

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,560
画上一个句点
Then it ends.

287
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,520
- 你好 Locke先生  - Shephard医生
- Hello, Mr. Locke.  - Dr. Shephard.

288
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,730
嘿 既然你都要切开我的背
Hey, since you're about to open up my back,

289
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
不如先叫我John吧
you can probably start calling me John.

290
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,040
好吧 John
Okay, John.

291
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,880
我想先过来打个招呼
I thought I'd stop by and say hi

292
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,460
然后再开始麻醉
before we started the anesthesia.

293
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,160
紧张吗?
You nervous?

294
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
你确定这能行?
Are you sure this is gonna work?

295
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,930
没错
Yes.

296
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,110
我保证会成功的
I'm very confident that it will.

297
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,300
真的吗?
Really?

298
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,790
总会有机会杀了你的...
Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you...

299
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,850
不过我想让你好受点
but I'm trying to make you feel better.

300
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,160
好吧 好吧 那开始吧
Okay. Okay, let's do it.

301
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,990
嗯 我在那边等你
All right. I'll see you on the other side.

302
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,340
嘿 医生 之前在洛杉矶机场 在行李认领处的时候
Hey, doctor, back at L.A.X., when we met at baggage claim,

303
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,200
你说你父亲失踪了
you mentioned that they had lost your father.

304
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,370
- 后来有找到吗?  - 其实 今早我接到电话
- Did he ever turn up?  - As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning.

305
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,120
- 他们 呃 找到了棺材  - 哦 太好了
- They, uh, they found the coffin.  - Oh, good.

306
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,100
可能现在就已经运来了
Actually, it might be here already.

307
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,640
那么 希望这能让你安心
Well, I hope that brings you some peace.

308
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,800
Locke先生 如果我可以医好你
If I can fix you, Mr. Locke,

309
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
就足够安心了
that's all the peace I'll need.

310
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
大风大浪即将来临
It's gonna be a hell of a storm.

311
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,910
欢迎加入
Welcome to the club.

312
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,370
什么?
What?

313
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,440
你不介意吧?
You mind?

314
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,140
看来你长了第一根白头发
Looks like you got your first gray hair.

315
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,380
你笑什么?
What are you smiling about?

316
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,210
我刚意识到我渴望生存
I think I just realized that I want to live.

317
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,390
真是时候
It's good timing.

318
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,910
那是什么?
What was that?

319
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,860
救命!
Help!

320
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,550
嘿!
Hey!

321
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,270
嘿! Miles 前面!
Hey! Miles, up ahead!

322
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,410
嘿!
Hey!

323
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,620
哦
Ohh.

324
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,100
给他点儿水
Get him some water.

325
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,670
你们来这儿干嘛?
What are you guys doing out here?

326
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,390
我们要去九头蛇岛把飞机炸了
We're going to Hydra Island to blow up a plane.

327
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,160
为什么?
What do you want to do that for?

328
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,270
因为黑烟意图逃出岛
Because the black smoke wants to get off the island,

329
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,860
我们必须阻止它
and we have to stop that thing from leaving.

330
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,750
如果我们离开了 那玩意儿就没飞机可用了
Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.

331
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,040
没错 可是要怎么做?
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that?

332
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,850
你们还不知道吧 我是个飞行员
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.

333
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,010
- 这下有趣儿了  - Kate!
- Well, this is gonna be interesting.  - Kate!

334
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,730
Kate啊
Kate!

335
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,260
是你杀了他们!
You killed them!

336
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,200
Kate! 够了
Kate! That's it.

337
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,010
- 够了  - 省省子弹吧
- That's it.  - You might wanna save your bullets.

338
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,700
是你
So it's you.

339
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,240
没错 是我
Yeah, it's me.

340
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,140
Jacob还是老样子
Jacob being who he is,

341
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,310
我还以为能有点儿小惊喜呢
I expected to be a little more surprised.

342
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,080
选你 那不是明摆着的嘛
You're sort of the obvious choice,

343
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,430
- 你说呢?  - 他没有选我 是我自愿的
- don't you think?  - He didn't choose me. I volunteered.

344
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,210
我猜你是来阻止我的
I assume you're here to stop me.

345
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,100
我阻止不了你
I can't stop you.

346
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
事实上 我 呃 想跟你一起走
In fact, I, uh, I wanna go with you.

347
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,110
抱歉 Jack
I'm sorry, Jack.

348
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,690
我想你有点儿搞不清楚状况
I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do.

349
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,680
没有
No, I'm not.

350
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,880
你要去竹林的另一头...
No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest...

351
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,760
那个我誓死要保护的地方
to the place that I've sworn that I'll protect.

352
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,180
- 你还认为你要毁了这座岛  - 我"认为"?
- And then you think you're gonna destroy the island.  - I "think"?

353
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,230
没错 因为这事不会发生
That's right, because that's not what's gonna happen.

354
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,310
Jack 那什么会发生?
Then what's gonna happen, Jack?

355
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,420
我会干掉你
I'm gonna kill you.

356
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,360
你打算怎么做?
How do you plan to do that?

357
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,810
会给你个惊喜
It's a surprise.

358
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,210

医生
Doctor.

没想到你今天还上班啊
I didn't know you were working today.

363
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,530
活儿还没干完呢 你拿到音乐会的票了吗?

365
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,270
嘿 爸爸 还记得票的事吗?
Hey, dad, did you remember the tickets?

366
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,640
我刚给你妈了
I just gave them to your mom.

367
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,460
- 呃 谁拿你这张呢?  - 如果你找不到其他人的话
- Uh, who's gonna take yours?  - Well, if you don't have anybody else,

368
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,970
或许你可以带Claire阿姨一起去
maybe you could take aunt Claire.

369
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,580
- 我想她会喜欢去外面走走的  - 哦 没错 我没意见
- I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.  - Oh, yeah. It's fine with me.

370
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,890
事实上 我对你这位神秘的妹妹非常好奇
In fact, I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister

371
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,020
我们结婚那么久 你对她只字未提
you never mentioned the entire time we were married.

372
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,400
我保证你会喜欢她的 她快生了
Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant.

373
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,600
祝你手术成功 医生
Good luck on your surgery, doctor.

374
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,870
谢谢
Thank you.

375
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,550
- 挑好领带了吗?  - 挑好了
- Did you pick out a tie?  - I did.

376
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,370
很好
Nice.

377
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,860
嗨 我是洛杉矶警局的Ford探员
Hi. I'm Detective Ford, L.A.P.D.

378
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,450
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

379
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,620
我要找一间病房... 叫Sun Paik的
I'm looking for a patient's room... Sun Paik.

380
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,320
你不想和大伙儿分享点什么故事吗 医生?
Something you wanna share with the rest of us, doc?

381
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,150
指什么?
What's that?

382
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,470
你说过你会杀死Locke的
You said you were gonna kill Locke.

383
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,000
- 你所谓的惊喜是什么?  - Desmond
- What's your surprise?  - Desmond.

384
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,620
那有什么用啊?
And how's that gonna work?

385
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,200
我也不知道 我不相信Jacob
I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob

386
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,920
会总让他回到这个岛上
would've brought him all the way back to this island

387
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,520
好让Locke利用他毁了这个岛
just so Locke could make him destroy it.

388
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,910
- 那又怎么样? Desmond是个诱饵?  - 不
- So what? Desmond's bait?  - No.

389
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,020
我觉得他是件武器
I think he's a weapon.

390
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,640
越听越糊涂了 医生
That's a hell of a long con, doc.

391
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,430
Jack和Desmond...
Jack, Desmond...

392
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,510
这儿只要我们三个人就行了
It should just be the three of us from here on.

393
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,780
Jack啊
Jack.

394
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,810
我相信你 哥们
I believe in you, dude.

395
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,020
这竹子要垮了
It's gonna be a bad one.

396
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,630
我们到了
We're here.

397
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,760
这么做无济于事的
This doesn't matter, you know.

398
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,960
你说什么?
Excuse me?

399
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,470
他要毁了这个岛 你要灭了他...
Him destroying the island, you destroying him...

400
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,830
有什么用呢
It doesn't matter.

401
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,230
你们把我放下去找那束光
I mean, you're gonna lower me into that light,

402
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,050
我会去另一个地方...
and I'm gonna go somewhere else...

403
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,170
在那儿 我们可以和喜欢的人待在一起
a place where we can be with the ones that we love

404
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,000
不用再考虑这个该死的岛了
and not have to ever think about this damn island again.

405
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,660
你知道最精彩的部分吗 Jack?
And you know the best part, Jack?

406
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,270
是什么?
What?

407
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,730
你也在那儿
You're in this place.

408
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,790
我们在大洋航空815航班上相邻而坐
You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815.

409
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,400
不曾坠毁
It never crashed.

410
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,230
我们互相交谈
We spoke to each other.

411
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,160
你看起来很高兴
You seemed happy.

412
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,680
或许我也有办法 把你带去那儿
You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there, too.

413
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,920
Desmond 我尝试过一次
Desmond, I tried that once.

414
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,990
没有捷径 也无法重新来过
There are no shortcuts, no do-overs.

415
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,750
事情发生了就是发生了 相信我 我知道的
What happened, happened. Trust me, I know.

416
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,870
我们所做的很有意义
All of this matters.

417
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,440
要继续吗?
Shall we?

418
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,380
我们待这儿干嘛呀?
What are we doing here?

419
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,880
别人不让我告诉你
I'm not allowed to tell you.

420
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,700
什么叫"别人不让"啊?
What do you mean, you're "not allowed"?

421
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,600
要守规矩的 哥们
There are rules, dude.

422
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,000
谁定的规矩?
Whose rules?

423
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,610
不用担心 相信我就行了 没问题吧?
Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay?

424
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,500
我相信你
I trust you.

425
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,670
我能问问 是什么让你这么相信我吗?
And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust?

426
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,450
我觉得你是个好人 Sayid
I think you're a good guy, Sayid.

427
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,330
我知道 很多人说你是个坏人
I know a lot of people have told you that you're not.

428
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,090
可能你听多了
Maybe you've heard it so many times

429
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,360
也就信了
you started believing it.

430
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,730
但你不能让别人来告诉你 你是怎样的人 哥们
But you can't let other people tell you what you are, dude.

431
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,230
这得靠你自己来决定
You have to decide that for yourself.

432
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,180
对不起
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,610
你显然对我一无所知
You clearly don't know anything about me.

434
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,840
我知道你很多事情 哥们
I know a lot about you, dude.

435
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,880
看起来像是一顿暴打
Looks like a gnarly fight.

436
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,460
嘿 放开我弟弟!
Hey, leave my brother alone!

437
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,830
嘿 没事儿了
Hey, it's all right.

438
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,310
Sayid啊
Sayid.

439
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,760
Shannon啊
Shannon.

440
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,860
我刚挨了顿揍 哥们
I just got pounded, man.

441
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,150
谢谢你抽空来
Thanks for taking your sweet time.

442
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,980
很乐意为你效劳
It takes as long as it takes.

443
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,130
把她从澳大利亚带回来真让人讨厌
It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia.

444
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,600
没错 但是 哥们你知道么? 这很值哦
Yeah. But, dude? It was worth it.

445
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,000
我应该上去打个招呼吗?
Should I go get 'em?

446
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,810
别 让他们单独待一会儿吧
Nah. Let's give 'em a minute.

447
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,570
Linus 听得到吗?
Linus, are you there?

448
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,750
那是什么玩意儿?
What the hell's that?

449
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,450
Miles 你在哪儿?
Miles, where are you?

450
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,160
我们刚到九头蛇岛
We just got to Hydra Island.

451
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,490
- 我们正往飞机那儿赶  - Miles 听我说
- We're on our way to the plane.  - Miles, listen to me.

452
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,330
- 无论你做什么 都不要炸掉那架飞机!  - 我们不会炸掉它的
- Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane!  - We're not gonna blow it up.

453
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,680
我们要乘着它离开这个岛
We're gonna fly it the hell off the island.

454
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,860
- 快过来吧!  - 搞什么鬼啊?
- Just get over here now!  - What in the hell?

455
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,670

456
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,530
Miles 我是Kate 你刚是说"Claire"吗?
Miles, it's Kate. Did you say "Claire"?

457
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,200
她还好吗?
Is she okay?

458
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,440
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

459
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,870

Don't come any closer!

460
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,510

是他派你来杀我的 对吧?
He sent you to kill me, didn't he?

464
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,680
不是 我们跟Locke不是一伙的
No, listen. We're not with Locke.

465
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,160
我凭什么相信你?
Why should I believe you?

466
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,300
因为我们有机会可以离他远远的了
Because we have a real chance to get far, far away from him.

467
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,360
我们终于能摆脱他的魔爪了
We can be free of everything he ever did to us

468
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,620
再也不用回来了
and never look back.

469
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,380
我们可以回家了
We can go home.

470
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,920
要和我们一起走吗 Claire?
Will you come with us, Claire?

471
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,590
不
No.

472
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,780
好吧 我们...
All right, we...

473
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,800
我们轻轻地把他放下去
we lower him down nice and easy.

474
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,190
你知道一到下面就该做什么了吧?
You know what to do once you get down there?

475
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,940
知道
Aye.

476
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,580
我要去最亮的那束光那儿
I'll go where the light's brightest.

477
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,590
不要挂了哦
Don't get yourself killed.

478
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,860
这让你想起些什么了吧 Jack?
This remind you of anything, Jack?

479
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,180
什么?
What?

480
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,220
Desmond啊...
Desmond...

481
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,580
穿过下面那个洞
Going down into a hole in the ground.

482
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,530
如果那儿有个按钮
If there was a button down there to push,

483
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,450
我们再争论要不要去按
we could fight about whether or not to push it.

484
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,140
就像以前那样
It'd be just like old times.

485
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,020
你不是John Locke
You're not John Locke.

486
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,820
你套着他的皮囊 这是对他记忆的亵渎
You disrespect his memory by wearing his face,

487
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,270
你和他分明就是两个人
but you're nothing like him.

488
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,870
结果证明他都是对的
Turns out he was right about most everything.

489
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,480
我多么希望 我能在他活着的时候 告诉他这些啊
I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.

490
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,890
他的想法都是错的 Jack
He wasn't right about anything, Jack.

491
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,190
当这个岛
And when this island

492
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,260
沉到海底的时候 当你和岛一起沉下去的时候
drops into the ocean, and you drop with it,

493
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,460
那会儿你就会明白了
you're finally gonna realize that.

494
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,460
好吧 那就让我们看看 到底谁是对的吧
Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.

495
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,870
哦
Oh.

496
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,440

It's the hospital.

Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.

498
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,030
- 对不起 我尽力赶回来  - 我知道 没事儿 去吧
- I am so sorry. I will be back as soon as I can.  - I know. It's cool. Go.

499
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,960
- 希望下次能更进一步互相了解 好么?  - 好的 一定
- We'll get to know each other better, I hope?  - Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

500
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,930
我 呃 我想就只剩我和你了吧 孩子
Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid.

501
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,890

好了 他现在稳定了 我得马上去洗个澡
Okay, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower

641
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,920
看看我能不能在音乐会结束前 赶上David

642
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,520
有需要就打电话给我
So just give me a call if you need anything.

643
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,640
Shepherd医生? 他好像醒了
Dr. Shephard? He's waking up.

644
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,220
麻醉时我也在场

好吧
Okay.

647
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,340
这里交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

648
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,760
Locke先生?
Mr. Locke?

649
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,920
能听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

650
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,560
John 你醒了吗?
John, are you awake?

651
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,350
你刚刚进行了一场大手术
You just had major surgery,

652
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,110
所以你还不能动
so I need you to try not to move

653
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,200
放松就可以了 好吗?
and just relax, okay?

654
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,790
手术起作用了
It worked.

655
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,740
没错 进行得很顺利
Well, it went well.

656

但是 我们还不确定 你对手术的反应程度如何...
But we won't know how well you responded to the surgery for...

657
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,060
不是的 Shepherd医生 手术起作用了
No, Dr. Shephard. It worked.

658
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,440
我可以感觉到我的腿了
I can feel my legs.

659
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,300
John 这基本不可能
John, it's highly unlikely

660
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,120
你不可能这么快恢复知觉
that you would regain sensation that quickly.

661
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,670
所以 我们只要...
So let's just take it s...

662
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,880

嗯...
Um...

669
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,480
Locke先生

670
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,110

我们得... 我们得走了

- Will you come with me?  - We're not going anywhere.

你没有儿子
You don't have a son.

677
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,040
你说什么?
What?

678
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,610
你没有儿子 Jack
You don't have a son, Jack.

679
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,610
医生?
Doctor?

680
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,000
Jane 嗯...
Jane, um...

681
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,300
你可以给Locke先生弄点什么 好让他静养吗?
Would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest?

682

我得走了
I need to go.

683
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,250

我不会有事的
I'll be fine.

690
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,060
只要给我找些缝合线 这点伤就不碍事
Just find me some thread, and I can count to five.

691
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:46,850
嘿!

693
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,900

01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,630
Locke死了

这真不像已经结束了
It sure don't feel like it's over.

01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,220
打扰一下 Paik女士?
Excuse me. Ms. Paik?

699
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,490

Yes?

He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you.

708

715
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,610
情况不妙 但应该能飞

716
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,870
我得重启电路
I've gotta reset the electronics.

717
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:31,950
液压系统出了问题
Something's wrong with the hydraulics

01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,260
就在前轮下端
down in the nose wheel.

719
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,360
你们俩谁懂机械吗? 嗯?
Is either one of you guys mechanical? Yeah?

720
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,230
我... 我曾给一个... 承包商装修过
I... I worked for a... a contractor renovating apartments

721

去下面 确保一切都正常
Go down there, make sure everything's hooked up right.

724
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,520

我不明白
I don't understand.

Locke已经死了 为什么还会这样?
Locke's dead. Why is this still happening?

732
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,490
因为不管Desmond关掉了什么
Because whatever Desmond turned off,

733
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,800
我都得再去把它打开
I need to turn it back on again.

734
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,470
但如果还是不行... 我没能把它修好...
But if it doesn't work... if I don't get it done...

735
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,470
你们现在就得离开 去搭上那架飞机

01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,330
你能修好吗?
Can you fix it?

757
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,290
我会怀疑很多事情
I don't believe in a lot of things,

758
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,970
但我绝不怀疑管道胶带的性能
but I do believe in duct tape.

759
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:04,980
是的 我们能行
Yeah, I think we're good.

760
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,350
我们赶紧离开这鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here.

761
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,430
唷 大胸男 这里是Sawyer和Kate
Yo, Chesty. It's Sawyer and Kate.

762
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,190
收到?
Yeah?

763
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:18,300
我们现在去坐帆船
We're on our way down to the sailboat,

764
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,630
然后再朝你们划去 别丢下我们!
then we're heading to you. Don't leave without us!

765
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,280
趁现在还可以起飞
We're gettin' off the ground

766
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,410
我们不能错失机会
while there's still ground to get off.

767
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,920
所以如果你们想走 最好赶紧过来
So if you wanna go, you better get your asses in gear.

768
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,040
Lapidus! Lapidus啊
Lapidus! Lapidus!

769
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,350
- 狗娘养的!  - 现在咋办?
- Son of a bitch!  - What now?

770
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,090
我们跳下去
We jump.

771
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:52,680
- 船上见了  - Kate!
- I'll see you at the boat.  - Kate!

772
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,490
嘿 你知道哪儿可以买点吃的吗?
Hey, you know where I can get some grub around here?

773
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,360
呃 自助餐厅已经关门了
Uh, the cafeteria's closed,

774
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,600
但是 走道尽头有个自动售货机
but there's a vending machine down the hallway.

775
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,220
谢谢 医生
Thanks, Doc.

776
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,410
嗯 别客气
Yeah, no problem.

777
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:50,320
噢 不会吧
Oh, come on.

778
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:55,840
真不可思议
Unbelievable.

779
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,480
需要我帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

780
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,100
没事 我是...
It's okay. I'm a...

781
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,350
我是警察
I'm a cop.

782
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,010
嗯 或许你应该瞧瞧机器的右边
Mm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights.

783
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,070
有意思
That's funny.

784
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,310
- 嗯 我可以告诉你个秘密吗?  - 请说
- Mm. Can I tell you a secret?  - Please.

785
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,950
如果你把插头拔了 然后再插上
If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again,

786
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,880
糖就会掉下来
the candy just drops right down.

787
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:32,260
是吗?
Is that right?

788
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,040
是的 而且确切地说 这是合法的
Yes, and it's technically legal.

789
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,080
噢
Oh.

790
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,550
我来试试看
I'll give that a shot.

791
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:50,670
哎呀
Oops.

792
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,310
可行哦
It worked.

793
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,340
噢
Oh.

794
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,950
哇哦
Whoa.

795
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,860
你感觉到了吗?
Did you feel that?

796
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,040
- 改天我们应该去喝点咖啡  - 我很乐意
- We should get coffee sometime.  - I'd love to,

797
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,690
但是那个机器把我的钱吞了 我只剩一张票子了
but that machine ate my dollar. I only got one left.

798
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,850
我们可以各付各的
We could go Dutch.

799
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,760

800
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,390

It's over.

809
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,280

音乐会 结束了
Concert. It's over.

811
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,800
你在找人吗?
You are looking for someone?

812
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,690
嗯 今晚我本应该把儿子送到这里来 而...
Yeah. My son was supposed to bring him here tonight. And...

813
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,710
而我却没能来...
and I couldn't come...

814
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,410
抱歉
I'm sorry.

815
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,990
给点提示如何?
Where do I remember you from?

816
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,770
我偷了你的笔
I stole your pen.

817
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,250
什么?
What?

818
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,890
呃...
Um...

819
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,730
在大洋航空815航班上
Oceanic 815.

820
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:42,300
从悉尼飞来的
From Sydney.

821
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,080
在你走出洗手间时 我撞到了你
I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom,

822
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,540
然后... 我偷了你的笔
and... I stole your pen.

823
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,570
我是这样认识你的吗?
And that's how I know you?

824
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:51,930
不是
No.

825
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,690
你不是这样认识我的
That's not how you know me.

826
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,320
我想死你了
I missed you so much.

827
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:21,740
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

828
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,920
我这是怎么了?
What is happening to me?

829
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:27,780
你是...
Who...

830
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,260
你是谁? 我并不...
Who are you? I don't...

831
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,720
我知道你还不理解 Jack
I know you don't understand, Jack.

832
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,460
但是 如果你跟来
But if you come with me,

833
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:40,930
你就会明白了
you will.

834
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,100
就在那边
It's over there.

835
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,240
我们怎么下去?
How we gettin' down there?

836
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,770
不是我们 是我一个人去
We're not. I'm going alone.

837
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,210
老兄 你不能独自一人下去 Desmond就是有去无回
Dude, you can't go down there alone. Desmond didn't make it.

838
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,750
你一个人怎么能逃出来?
How the hell are you gonna survive?

839
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,590
不行
No.

840
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,680
没门 我不会让你去送死
No way. I'm not gonna let you die.

841
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:44,880
Hurley 我已经是个死人了
Hurley, I'm already dead.

842
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,160
- 你说过你会保护这个岛的!  - 而这正是我要做的
- You said you'd protect the island!  - And that's what I'm doing.

843
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,530
- 你这是自杀!  - 不是的 命运这是不可避免的
- You're committing suicide!  - I'm not. This is the way it has to happen.

844
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,240
这就是我的职责
This is what I'm supposed to do.

845
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:55,300
你不该送死! 岛需要你!
You're not supposed to die! The island needs you!

846
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:56,500
Hurley啊...
Hurley...

847
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,130
它需要你
It needs you.

848
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,010
什么?
What?

849
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,300
它需要的是你 Hugo
It needs to be you, Hugo.

850
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:13,620
我不能
I can't.

851
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,260
应该是你
It's supposed to be you.

852
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,650
正因为是我 所以我才能这么做
It was only supposed to be me so I could do this.

853
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,270
但是 如果说它需要谁来爱护
But if someone has to take care of the island,

854
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,950
需要谁来保护的话 那么... 人选非你莫属
if someone has to protect it, then... then it should be you.

855
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:27,730
Hurley啊...
Hurley...

856
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:30,730
我相信你
I believe in you.

857
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,330
好的 我会保护它的
All right, I'll take it.

858
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,270
但是 只是暂时为之
But it's only temporary.

859
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,650
等你把光找回来回来 我就把你拉上来
As soon as you get that light back on, I'm pulling you up,

860
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,260
- 我就把这个权利还给你 怎么样?  - 成交
- And I'm giving it right back to you. Deal?  - Deal.

861
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,210
你有可以喝水的东西吗?
Do you have anything to drink?

862
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,100
随便什么用来装水的东西? 比如杯子... 或者水壶
Anything to drink out of? A... a cup. A canteen.

863
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:00,990
我有
I do.

864
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:05,810
这个行吗?
Is that okay?

865
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:07,730
完美
Perfect.

866
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,700
把这喝了
Drink this.

867
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,770
这样就行了?
Is that it?

868
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,020
现在你跟我一样
Now you're like me.

869
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,020
第二次希望有效
Second time's a charm.

870
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,740
最好这样 因为我们肯定
It better be, 'cause we sure as hell

871
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,770
没有电量启动第三次
don't have the battery power for a third time.

872
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:23,950
可以了吗?
Is that good?

873
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,060
朋友 那可是天簌之音
That, my friends, is pure music.

874
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:32,670
慢点
Easy.

875
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,510
慢点 慢点
Easy. Easy.

876
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,480
老兄!
Dude!

877
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,430
Desmond啊
Desmond!

878
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:23,950
Desmond啊
Desmond!

879
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,260

Can you hear me?

880
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,400
啊! 啊!
Aah! Ah!

881
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,750
光...
The light...

882
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,880
我把它灭了
I put it out.

883
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,070
还是没用
It didn't work.

884
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,130
我以为我已经离开这儿了
I thought I'd leave this place.

885
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,530

你是对的 Jack
You were right, Jack.

889
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,960
对啊 什么都有第一次嘛
Yeah, well, there's a first time for everything.

890
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,160

01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:01,570
啊! 我必须要把石头塞回去
Uhh! I have to put it back.

892
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,310
- 它像个下水道一样  - 你刚才那么做了?
- It was like a drain.  - That's what you did?

893
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,010
- 你把石头从洞里拔出来了?  - Jack 你不行 听我说
- You took that stone out of that hole over there?  - Jack, you can't. Listen.

894
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,110
即使你把它放回去了 你的小命也就跟着玩完了 这件事必须我来干
Even if you turn it back on, it'll kill ya. It has to be me.

895
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,020
Desmond 你做得够多了
Desmond, you've done enough.

896
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,460
你想做事情啊? 那就回家跟你老婆孩子团聚
You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son.

897
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,760
那你怎么办 Jack?
How about you, Jack?

898
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,790
兄弟 我们来生再见
I'll see you in another life, brother.

899
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,240

900
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:51,190

Miles 看着舱门外! 你当我的眼睛
Miles, go look out the door! You're gonna be my eyes while I

902
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,570

- 为什么?!  - 看看我现在!
- Why?!  - Look at me!

908
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:33,420
这座岛把我逼疯了
This island's made me crazy.

909
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,170
我... 我不想让Araon看到我这个样子
I... I don't want Aaron to see me like this.
