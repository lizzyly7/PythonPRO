她从来没有得到你的...关爱

因为她所知道的

00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,002
是你抛弃了她

Penelope已经开始新生活了  Hume

00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,076
她要结婚了

这是为了让你离开我的女儿  开始新生活而准备的

你为什么认为我会离开她?
And what makes you think I would just run away?

103
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,053
因为你是个懦夫

104
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,096
在去葬礼的路上

00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,099
我告诉过你Michael已经向其他人妥协了

106
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,099
然后你问我怎样才能有所防备
And then you asked me how we might take advantage of that.

107
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,066
我想命运已经给我们答案
I believe fate has given us our answer

108
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,069
那艘船
The boat.

109
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,002
那艘船?
The boat?

110
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,062
Michael带你去的营地...
This camp Michael is leading you to across the island,

111
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,002
他们会在那里设陷阱
that is where they will set their trap.

112
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,002
当Michael从岛上带你们去的时候

113
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:59,072
我可以从水上过去
I can approach far more quickly by sea

114
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,029
我能靠岸且不被发现
and I can go ashore undetected.

115
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,072
靠岸后做什么?
Go ashore and do what?

116
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:07,056
先侦查一下  他们的人数和位置
Scout them. Their numbers and positions.

117
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,079
还有他们的武器
Their weapons.

118
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,079
然后我会去最近的一个海滩
Then I'll go to the nearest beach

119
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,022
用这些来点起烽烟
and start a signal fire with these.

120
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,022
他们烧起来会产生暗黑色的烟
They burn with a dark black smoke.

121
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:19,043
你和你的队员就朝信号来找我吧

122
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,096
我们就可以一起去了

123
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,043
我们还无法确信Michael已经背叛了我们

124
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:28,053
他已经背叛了
He has been turned by them.

125
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:33,062
我得去告诉Kate  Hurley还有Sawyer...
I'll have to tell Kate and Hurley and Sawyer what we're doing...

126
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:38,016
不  不能让Michael察觉他的谎言被看穿了
No. Michael cannot sense we know he is lying.

127
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:41,069
我们需要的就是出其不意  Jack
All we have is the element of surprise, Jack.

128
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,069
现在  就要靠你来
Right now, it's only your responsibility

129
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,022
保守秘密了
to keep it secret.

130
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,079
黑烟  是么?
Black smoke, huh?

131
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,099
这次...
This time...

132
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:58,043
他们就会知道黑烟是代表我们来了

我一直在思考
I've been thinking.

136
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,049
思考什么?
About what?

137
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,004
在一分钟之内
That in a minute

138
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,086
电脑就会发出蜂鸣声
that computer's gonna start beeping.

139
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,092
你不要做什么  就随它去
And when it does, you're gonna let it go.

140
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:28,002
你就让时间变为零  到零以下去
You're gonna let it run down to zero, past zero

141
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,053
你不要去按按键
and you're not gonna push the button.

142
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,069
但是我就要去按按键
But I am going to push the button.

143
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,022
为什么我不呢?
Why wouldn't I?

144
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:38,036
因为你不想成为一个奴隶
Because you don't want to be a slave.

145
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:41,049
我不是任何人的奴隶
I am a slave to nothing.

146
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,053
你是这台电脑的奴隶
You're a slave to that.

147
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:46,006
就像以前的我一样
Just like I was.

148
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:50,009
我再和你说一次
So I'm gonna tell you again

149
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,022
...别按
...don't push it.

150
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:58,032
别和我说什么我不该做
Do not tell me what I can't do.

151
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:08,049
你不能按按键
You cannot push that button!

152
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:17,032
不  那不是真的
No, it's not real!

153
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:21,032
我们只是个木偶  吊线木偶
We're only puppets! Puppets on strings!

154
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:24,086
只要我们按按键  我们永远都不会自由
As long as we push it, we'll never be free.

155
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:27,059
那你现在自由了  John
Well, you're free now, John.

156
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,019
别再回来
Do not come back.

157
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,019
不
No.

158
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,093
不用了  我拿了它就会杀人
No way. If I take that, I'm gonna kill someone.

159
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,069
我们不就为了这个么?
Ain't that the point?

160
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:56,019
我想我们是为了把Walt带回来
I thought the point was to get Walt back.

161
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:02,039
怎么了?
What's the matter?

162
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,056
我们在另一个舱内找到的...
All that stuff we found in the medical station.

163
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:08,039
服装  化妆品  假胡子
Costumes, makeup, fake beards.

164
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,006
会不会是这些人想让我们觉得他们是山里人?
What these people just want us to think they're hillbillies.

165
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,006
听着听着  我去过那里
Listen. Listen, I was there.

166
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,069
我看见过他们  他们就是山里人
I saw them. They are hillbillies.

167
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,069
他们住的是棚屋  吃的是鱼
They live in huts. They eat fish.

168
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,076
他们可能比我们还要害怕
They're probably more scared than we are

169
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:25,012
而且他们不知道我们要过去
and they have no idea we're on our way.

170
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,089
好的
All right.

171
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,046
好了  伙计  我们走吧
Enough jibber-jabber. Let's roll.

172
00:12:56,099 --> 00:13:00,069
我需要你的船
I need your boat.

173
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:03,098
我不会浪费你的时间  外面什么都没有 伙计
I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal.

174
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,069
我不出海
I'm not going out there.

175
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,069
我要快点去岛的北岸
I need to get to the north shore, and quickly.

176
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,013
去看敌人  是么?
Off to see the hostiles, are you?

177
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,082
什么?
The what?

178
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,016
你知道么?
You know what?

179
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:17,072
眼不见为净
Ignorance is bliss.

180
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,016
船是你的了  伙计
The boat's all yours, brother.

181
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,066
祝你好运
For all the good it'll do you.

182
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,033
我不懂怎么航海
I don't know how to sail.

183
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:33,026
那我建议你找个懂的
Then I suggest you find someone who does.

184
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:43,013
给我来一个
Just give me

185
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,093
咖啡因很足的  伙计
whichever one has the most caffeine in it, brother.

186
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:49,003
该死...
Ah, damn.

187
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,098
抱歉  我刚到这里  并且...
I'm sorry, I've just arrived

188
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:55,016
我把所有美元都用在出租车上了
and I spent all my American money on a taxi.

189
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,019
算我的
I've got it.

190
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,021
不用了吧
That's not necessary.

191
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:01,013
只是四块钱
It's just four bucks.

192
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,044
我想你没有四万两千块吧?
I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those, do you?

193
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,000
就要看用来干什么了
Depends on what it's for.

194
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,041
开个玩笑
I was joking.

195
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:11,009
不是吧
No, you weren't.

196
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,072
一个单人环球船赛?
A solo sailing race around the world?

197
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:19,025
我有八个月时间来达到最佳状态
I've got eight months to get into the best shape of my life.

198
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,094
但我告诉你  小姐
But I'll tell you what, miss.

199
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,053
我要赢
I'm going to win.

200
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,044
如果你赢了你会得到什么?
And what do you get if you do?

201
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,069
最重要的是...
What really matters...

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,054
我从谁这里赢
is who I win it from.

203
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,030
Charles Widmore

204
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,036
他想花钱让我离开
He tried to buy me off

205
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,060
如果我不拿他的钱
and when I didn't take his money

206
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,004
他就带走我在这个世界上
he took away the only thing in the world

207
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:48,071
唯一真正关心的人
that I ever truly cared about.

208
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,086
她是谁?
Who is she?

209
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,052
他的女儿
His daughter.

210
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:59,081
我和她有好些地方配不上
I was unsuitable on several levels.

211
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,086
那么你要四万两千块钱干吗?
And what's the 42 grand for?

212
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,082
有些复杂
It's a wee bit complicated.

213
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:08,059
到现在为止  我还没有船
As of yet, I don't actually have a boat.

214
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:15,059
抱歉  我说错什么了么?
Sorry, did I say something wrong?

215
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,080
我有船
I have a boat.

216
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,051
是我丈夫的  但是...
It was my husband's, but...

217
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,017
他得了场病  并且...
he got sick, and...

218
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,067
他想开船去地中海
He wanted to sail to the Mediterranean

219
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,019
但是他没能做到...
but he never...

220
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,096
他死了...
He passed away...

221
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:46,055
大约一个月前
about a month ago.

222
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:51,084
我很难过
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,062
我想把船给你
I want you to have it.

224
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:06,093
我...我不能要你的船  小姐
I...I can't take your boat, miss.

225
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,069
但是你必须要
But you have to.

226
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,043
他也希望你要
He'd want you to.

227
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,092
你丈夫叫什么名字?
What was your husband's name?

228
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,082
David

229
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,015
他把船取名什么?
And what did he name his boat?

230
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,073
Elizabeth

231
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,028
他用我的名字给船取名的
He named it after me.

232
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,007
那么...
Then

233
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:51,049
我谢谢你  Elizabeth
I thank you, Elizabeth.

234
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,048
我会赢下这次比赛...
And I shall win this race...

235
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:59,017
为了爱
for love.

236
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,031
能让我们单独谈谈么?
Would you excuse us, please?

237
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,042
我在岸边等
I'll be at the shore.

238
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:30,012
Sayid想让你开船去岛的另一面

239
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,038
去帮助Michael

240
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,025
不

241
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:40,055
我不会离开你的  至少现在不会

242
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:43,082
你不会离开我的  Jin

243
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:48,082
因为我要跟你一起去

244
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,049
别碰它
Don't even think about it.

245
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,036
是个陷阱
It's a trap.

246
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:12,069
一个网  Rousseau在岛上所有地方都安放了
A net. Rousseau's got 'em all over the island.

247
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:15,039
你怎么知道的?
How the hell would you know that?

248
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,082
我和Jack被网起来过
I kind of tripped one with Jack.

249
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,033
我们最后...
We ended up...

250
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,079
别提了
Never mind.

251
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,049
怎么了?
What?

252
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,049
当医生告诉我说你们被网住了
When the doc told me you all got caught in a net

253
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,049
我以为他是说...
I thought he meant...

254
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,006
其它的什么
something else.

255
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:39,033
从什么时候开始你和Jack谈起我来了?
And since when did you and Jack start talking about me?

256
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:03,076
那只鸟是在叫我的名字么?
Did that bird just say my name?

257
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:07,076
是的  它叫了...
Yeah, it did...

258
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:11,052
在它压了金块作赌注前
right before it crapped gold.

259
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:25,069
抱歉  可能我忘了装弹药了
Sorry, man. I guess I forgot to load that one.

260
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,015
John?

261
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:03,015
你的脸怎么了?
What happened to your face?

262
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,033
没事  我很好
Nothing. I'm fine.

263
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,004
如果你感到少许不安
...if you're feeling a little sorry for yourself

264
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,034
你...你也许想喝点什么
you may want to have a drink

265
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:14,072
和你舱子里的伙伴一起
with your mate from the hatch.

266
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,089
我听说他也很沮丧
I hear he's a little despondent as well.

267
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,022
什么?
What?

268
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,084
对了  你当时不在场  
Oh, that's right. You weren't there

269
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,069
在葬礼上那出戏剧性的回归场面
for the dramatic arrival at the funeral.

270
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,020
我想他按了太多次的按键
I think he's pushed your buttons too many times

271
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:33,002
是的  Desmond
Yeah, Desmond.

272
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:37,025
我肯定你们两个有很多好谈的
I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.

273
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,028
如果我没说清楚我很抱歉  但是...
I'm sorry if what I said was confusing, but...

274
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,066
我只叫Jin和我一起去
I asked Jin to come.

275
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,059
你需要一个翻译
You need someone to translate

276
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,089
而且你需要至少两个懂得航海的人
and you need at least two people who know how to sail.

277
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:09,094
-Desmond全是靠自己航海的  -那你看他现在的样子
-Desmond managed by himself. -And look where he ended up.

278
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,014
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time, sister.

279
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:30,047
我每隔九天注射那个东西
I shot myself with that stuff every nine days

280
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,073
一直持续了三年
for three years.

281
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,012
他很可爱
He's lovely.

282
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:44,090
他...他父亲也在这个岛上么?
Is the... is the father here on the island?

283
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:48,047
不  他很早以前就走了
Nope, he's been gone a long time.

284
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:51,015
就是走了
Just sort of walked off the moment

285
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:53,062
他对当时的情况感到害怕
he got a bit scared by the situation.

286
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:59,000
也许他知道他当不好父亲
Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad.

287
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,076
看来他是为你好
Thought he was doing what was best for you.

288
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,072
他是为他自己好
He was doing what was best for him.

289
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,004
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

290
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:57,035
你的房东告诉我你每天来这跑步...
Landlord at your flat told me you ran here...

291
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,032
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

292
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,003
我有很多钱  Desmond
I have a lot of money, Desmond.

293
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:05,062
有钱又有决心  你可以找到任何人
With money and determination, you can find anyone.

294
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,054
你读了你心爱的书了么...
Did you read your beloved book?

295
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:15,033
那本你留着的书?
The one you were saving?

296
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:18,096
还没有
Not yet.

297
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,014
我以为你走了的时候读过它了
I thought you might have read it while you were away.

298
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:25,091
我被关进了监狱
I was in prison.

299
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,025
不是走了
Not away.

300
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,064
你为什么不给我写信?
Why didn't you write to me?

301
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,073
你准备什么时候结婚  Pen?
When are you getting married, Pen?

302
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:53,088
我们还没定日子
We haven't set a date yet.

303
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,064
我一年后回来
I'll be back in a year.

304
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:57,053
如果你现在就回来呢?
What if you were back right now?

305
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,095
我一定要赢得这场比赛  Pen...
I'm going to win this race, Pen.

306
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,082
他的比赛
His race.

307
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,021
一年后
And in a year

308
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,000
我就回来了
I'll be back.

309
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,050
Desmond  你这是为了什么?
Desmond, what are you running from?

310
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:35,063
我要赢回大家对我的尊敬
I have to get my honor back...

311
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,037
我就是为了这个
...and that's what I'm running to.

312
00:24:56,076 --> 00:25:00,090
那么一个雪人对另一个雪人说了什么?
So, what did one snowman say to the other snowman?

313
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,018
闻起来像胡萝卜
Smells like carrots.

314
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,059
你好  Desmond
Hello, Desmond.

315
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,048
你好  做箱子的
Hello, yourself, Box Man.

316
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,065
不介意吧?
Do you mind?

317
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,010
你喝吧
Oh, I insist.

318
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:20,070
那么你是修好了电脑了?
So you managed to fix the computer then, did you?

319
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,027
世界不是还没被毁么?
The world's still here, ain't it?

320
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:27,043
我不是太确定  伙计
I'm not so sure about that, brother.

321
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:29,012
让我想想  Desmond
Refresh my memory, Desmond.

322
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:33,067
你说你在舱子里呆了多久了?
How long did you say that you were down there in the hatch?

323
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:35,084
三年
Three years.

324
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,089
Desmond  如果我告诉你...
Desmond, what if I told that... for all that

325
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,086
全部的那三年
all those years

326
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,082
你和所有的以前在那里的人
that you and all the men before you

327
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,046
按那个按键...
were down there pushing that button...

328
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:52,039
如果我告诉你那都是没有意义的...
What if I told you it was all for nothing?

329
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:56,056
我问你
I'd ask you how the hell

330
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,050
你怎么知道这些的?
did you know something like that.

331
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:01,069
我找到了另一个舱子
I found another hatch.

332
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,061
岛上的另一个站点
Another station on the island.

333
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:08,069
他们叫它珍珠
They called it The Pearl.

334
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:12,045
我在那看了影片...东方公司的影片...
And I saw a film there. An orientation film

335
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,037
它说
and it said

336
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:16,071
我们舱子里发生的所有事...
that everything that was happening in our hatch...

337
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,067
都是假的
wasn't real.

338
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,066
只是一个试验
That it was a test.

339
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,081
一个心理试验
A psychological experiment.

340
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,038
你在骗人
You're lying.

341
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,002
想走走么?
You want to take a walk?

342
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,084
我来准备爆米花
I'll make the popcorn.

343
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,086
如果你那么肯定那不是真的
If you're so sure it's not real,

344
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,071
那就别按按键了啊
then just stop pushing the button.

345
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,000
我不幸被排除在外了
I have, except, unfortunately

346
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:58,089
有另外的人来按了
someone else decided to start.

347
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:02,017
所以你要冷静点
So you're gonna sober up.

348
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:05,040
我们晚上好好睡一觉
And we're gonna get a good night's sleep

349
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:08,054
明天我们去找出如果不按按键
and tomorrow,we're gonna find out what happens

350
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:11,021
会发生什么
 if that button doesn't get pushed.

351
00:27:28,034 --> 00:27:30,067
伙计  要吃的么?
Dharma NutraBar?

352
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:32,090
不  谢谢  我不饿
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

353
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:34,025
你没开玩笑吧?
You serious?

354
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:01,009
你还好吧?
You all right?

355
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:05,004
是的  只是想多捡点木材点火
Yeah, just getting some more firewood.

356
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:06,025
还不够热
Not feeling too hot.

357
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:09,087
你不应该独自出来的
You shouldn't be out here alone.

358
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:13,038
-我帮你吧 -好的
-I'll... I'll give you a hand. -Yeah.

359
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:22,022
谢谢你们为了我的孩子而冒险
thanks for coming out here, risking your neck for my boy.

360
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,087
同生独死  伙计
Live together, die alone, man.

361
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,057
是的
Yeah.

362
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,003
跟你说了要你别来

363
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,082
我不是晕船  Jin

364
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,034
有个东西你来看看

365
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:20,031
不知是哪个更让人不安...
I don't know what is more disquieting

366
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:22,095
雕像的其它部分没了...
the fact that the rest of the statue is missing

367
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,017
还是它只有四个脚趾
or that it has four toes.

368
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:28,018
8...7...6...
Eight. Seven. Six.

369
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:35,072
5...  4...  1...
Five. Four. One.

370
00:30:45,063 --> 00:30:47,051
John

371
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:51,097
干的漂亮
Neat trick.

372
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:53,092
你能听见么?  开门
Can you hear me? Open up!

373
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,029
我希望你能确信这件事  伙计
I hope you're sure about this.

374
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,031
这件事我比任何事都要确信
I'm more sure about this than anything in my entire life.

375
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,077
别这么干  John
Don't do this! John!

376
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,018
那么好吧  做箱子的
All right then, Box Man.

377
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,094
我们在这等
We wait.

378
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:44,004
你是他么?
Are you him?

379
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:50,021
一个雪人对另一个雪人说了什么?
What did one snowman say to the other?

380
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,055
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

381
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:03,069
你是谁?
Who are you?

382
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,002
我叫Inman
I'm Inman.

383
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,034
Kelvin Inman

384
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,066
我的...
What...

385
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,029
我的船怎样了?
what happened to my boat?

386
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:24,046
我发现你被冲上了海滩
I found you washed up on the beach.

387
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,013
不过没看到有船
There was no boat.

388
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,094
你这是在做什么?
What was all that about, then?

389
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,053
拯救世界
Just saving the world.

390
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:32,031
在试验开始后不久
Not long after the experiments began, however,

391
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:35,013
发生了一件...意外
there was... an incident.

392
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,018
从那时开始
And since that time

393
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,041
就制定了下面的方案
the following protocol has been observed.

394
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,004
每隔108分钟
Every 108 minutes

395
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:44,041
就要按一下按键
the button must be pushed.

396
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,022
从警报声开始起
From the moment the alarm sounds

397
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,096
你有四分钟时间向电脑里
you will have four minutes to enter the code

398
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,060
输入数字
into the micro-computer processor.

399
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,073
你还要看几遍?
How many times you gonna watch that thing?

400
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,053
为什么有部分没了?
Why are there missing parts?

401
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:03,052
Radzinsky做了剪辑
Radzinsky made some edits.

402
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,064
谁是Radzinsky?
Who's Radzinsky?

403
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,058
我的搭档
He was my partner.

404
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:10,012
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

405
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:11,090
记得你看完了把它
Just make sure you put that back

406
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,057
放在"螺旋桨的转动"那本书后面
 behind Turn of the Screw when you're done with it.

407
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:17,056
你为什么穿那套衣服?
Why do you wear that suit?

408
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:20,024
这样在外面我就不会被感染了
So I don't get infected out there.

409
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,028
每隔九天给自己注射一下
Give yourself a shot of this every nine days.

410
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,083
在我找到你之前你在外面有段时间了
You were out there a while before I found you.

411
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,006
希望现在注射不是太晚
I hope it's not too late.

412
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:46,098
做箱子的... 在外面敲门的那个人是谁? 
Who is he, Box Man? The man out there pounding on the door.

413
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,051
他叫Eko先生
His name is Mr. Eko.

414
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,058
为什么Eko先生一直带着
Why does Mr. Eko carry around

415
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:53,066
一根刻有经文的棒子?
a stick covered in scripture?

416
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:55,034
因为他是一个牧师
Because he's a priest.

417
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:58,004
快开门  求你了  别这么做
Open the door, please. Don't do this.

418
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,001
John  能听见么  快开门
John! Can you hear me? Open up!

419
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:03,027
我们把一个牧师锁在了外面?
We locked out a priest?

420
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,005
John

421
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,021
Charlie  你知道他们怎么把舱门打开的么?
Charlie, do you know how they got the hatch door open?

422
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:52,047
不知道  不过如果你哼个调子 我可能可以弹奏出来
No, but if you hum it, I could probably play it.

423
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:54,085
他们怎么打开的? 那个写有"检疫隔离"的舱门
How did they open it? The door that says "quarantine".

424
00:36:55,064 --> 00:36:57,002
他们炸开的  怎么了?
They blew it up. Why?

425
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,011
Charlie  我需要你的帮助
Charlie, I need your help.

426
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,096
现在你需要我了  神父?
Oh, now I'm back in your good graces, Father?

427
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:04,099
Charlie  John把我关在舱子外面了
Charlie, John has locked me out of the hatch

428
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:06,026
我相信他之所以这么做
and I believe he is doing this because

429
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,017
是因为他不想去按按键
he is going to stop pushing that button.

430
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,067
并且Charlie  我绝对肯定
And Charlie, I am absolutely certain

431
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:13,050
如果他成功了  在90分钟以内
that if he is successful in 90 minutes

432
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,034
岛上所有的人都会死
everyone on this island will die.

433
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,093
好吧  我帮你
All right, I'm in.

434
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:21,072
谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,043
来吧  快点
Come on, quick.

436
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:27,026
那么这些其它人...
So these Others

437
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:29,063
是达摩组织留下的么?
you think they're left over from the Dharma folk?

438
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,075
我不知道  伙计
I don't know, man.

439
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,087
我的理解?  他们是外星人
My theory? They're aliens.

440
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,065
所以他们用假胡子...
That's why they use the fake beards.

441
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,099
他们的头是塑料做的
Their heads, made of plastetic.

442
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,079
你读错音了  伙计
Prosthetic, dude.

443
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:42,036
你根本不会拼写  现在倒来纠正我了?
You can't even spell, and now you're correcting me?

444
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,042
你怎么认为  小妞?
What do you think, Freckles?

445
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:45,092
一直走  我们被跟踪了
Just keep moving, we're being followed.

446
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:46,078
什么?
What?

447
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:48,012
继续保持笑容
Just keep smiling.

448
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,047
他们至少有两个人  在河对面
There's at least two of them across the river.

449
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:58,037
大约五秒钟后  我就要行动了
In five seconds, I'm gonna turn the tables on them.

450
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,099
-那个  等等  -你也来么?
-Well, wait a second.  -You in?

451
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,098
他要逃了
He's getting away.

452
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,098
他死了
He's dead.

453
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:34,049
-我们得找到另外一个  -不
-We have to find the other!  -No.

454
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,080
-我要去  Sawyer...  -我说了不
-I'm going. Sawyer...  -I said no!

455
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,016
你疯了么? 让他逃了他们就会知道我们来了
Crazy? They'll know we're coming.

456
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,015
-他会通知他们...  -这和我们抓不抓他无关了
-He'll warn them.  -It doesn't matter if we catch him now.

457
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,070
他们已经被通报了
They've already been warned.

458
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,027
你是什么意思  被通报了?
What do you mean, "warned"?

459
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,016
-你为什么不说话  Michael?  -Jack...
-Why don't you tell them, Michael?  -Jack...

460
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,019
-我不知道你在说什  -别装了
-Don't know what you're talking about.  -Stop lying!

461
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:10,055
告诉他们
Tell them.

462
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,072
告诉他们什么?
Tell them what? I...

463
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:14,017
我知道你在做什么了  Michael
I know what you're doing, Michael!

464
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:17,001
现在告诉他们实情
