剧情回顾...
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:03,073 --> 00:00:05,024
我不在乎Jack怎么说
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:06,083
我们要把他救回来
They've got him. We have to get him back.

4
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,038
我欠他的
I owe him that.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,039
那个屋子里的男人 你以前见过他?
The man in the house. You said you seen him before?

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,051
就是珍珠舱录像里的那个人
On the video feed from the pearl station.

7
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:14,088
我们为什么还要兜圈子呢
Why are we continuing to play this little game,

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,090
为什么不直接切入正题?
when we all know it has moved to the next stage?

9
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:23,088
这张地图显示所有电能
This is a map showing electrical and data cabling

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,086
提供给了一个住宅区
comprised of houses and dormitories.

11
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:28,082
那地方一定很值得拜访
Sounds like a place well worth visiting.

12
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:32,073
当我看见闪电击打顶棚时你被电死了
I saw a lightning hit the roof. You were electrocuted.

13
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,028
你下水去救Claire的时候
And when you heard Claire was in the water,

14
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,054
你自己却淹死了
you drown trying to save her.

15
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:38,029
结果我下了水 你就得救了 我试过了 兄弟
I dove in myself so you never went in. I'm trying pal,

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,091
我救了你两次 但不论我怎么做
I tried twice to save you, but no matter what I try to do...

17
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:45,046
你都会死的 Charlie
you gonna die Charlie.

18
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:41,082
妈妈? 妈妈!
Mom!

19
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:57,006
看啊 Aron 你妈妈终于决定起床了
Oh look, Aaron! Your mom has finaly decided to wake up.

20
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:04,095
多亏了我借走你的小矮人 你才睡着的
The only way I could get you to sleep in was to borrow the midget.

21
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,017
这些都是什么?
And, what is all this?

22
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:11,061
开味酒和这岛上神秘的水果
An aperitive, of mysterious island fruit.

23
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:16,082
然后还有我特意为你准备的野餐
Before the breakfast picnic I have set up in your honor

24
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,008
就在不远的沙滩
a short walk down the beach.

25
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,099
你怎么了Charlie?
What's gotten into you, Charlie?

26
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,082
一个星期以来你都很沮丧
It's just, you've been so depressed all week,

27
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:27,096
而现在 野餐和枕边小吃?
and now it's breakfast in bed and picnics?

28
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:29,048
早晨醒来我想
I woke up this morning, and I thought,

29
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,096
是时候振作精神了 让自己占有这一天
it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and seize the day,

30
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:39,071
然后我就想到了你
and I can't think of anyone I'd rather do some day-seizing with than you.

31
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:42,053
那...你怎么说?
So... What do you say?

32
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:44,031
让我们把这小天使
Let's drop the cherub off

33
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:47,059
交给Sun阿姨和Jin叔叔
with auntie Sun and uncle Jin,

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,005
让我们去享受吧
and you and I go for a little stroll.

35
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,010
正合我意
I would love to.

36
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,029
照小溪的方位 我们应该在这里
From the position of this stream, we should be here,

37
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,021
如果比例正确的话
and if the scale is right,

38
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,083
他的人一定在那个方向的两英里外
his people are 2 miles in that direction.

39
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:10,050
我没有期望你的确认
I don't expect you to confirm that.

40
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,045
这只是电缆的地图 Sayid
It's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

41
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,007
我不像你那么确定它的精确度
I'm not sure it's as accurate as you think.

42
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:19,035
那当然没有你那神奇的棍子来的精确
Well, it's certainly not as infallible as the magical carvings on your stick.

43
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:21,064
那棍子带我们去了那个站
Hey, the stick didget us to that station.

44
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:24,032
是那个你不小心炸掉的站吗?
Oh, the station which you accidentally blew up.

45
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,012
如果你提醒我那到处是C-4的话
If you'd have warned me that the basement was rigged with C-4,

46
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:32,013
我也许会小心点
I might've been a little more careful.

47
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,051
你就不能告诉我们正确的方向吗?
Why don't you just tell us if we're going the right way?

48
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,021
你们走的没错
You're going the right way.

49
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:40,075
我们为什么让他活着呢?
Remind me why we're keeping him alive.

50
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,057
你有什么建议 像打狗一样杀了他?
What do you suggest, we shoot him like a dog?

51
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,070
不 我喜欢狗
No. I like dogs.

52
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:48,032
他是对的 他们不会用他的生命和你的朋友交换的
He's right. They would not trade his life for your friend's.

53
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,037
我们应该杀了他
We should shoot him.

54
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,042
够了 谁都别说了
Enough! Nobody's shooting anybody.

55
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,023
地图告诉我们他们的方位他说我们的方向是正确的
The map says where they are, and he says the map is right,

56
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:59,006
所以继续前进吧
so just keep moving.

57
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:07,002
我们到了
Okay, here we are, here we are.

58
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,010
不错是吧?
Not bad, eh?

59
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,033
简直棒极了
Not bad at all.

60
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:12,039
你先请坐吧
Well, if you'll take your seat,

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,094
我们有麦片 新鲜的水果沙拉
we will begin with our first course,which is cereal.We have fresh fruit salad

62
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:21,061
早上好
Good morning.

63
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:25,026
恩...早上好
Good morning yourself.

64
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,014
什么风把你吹来了 Desmond?
What brings you down to the beach?

65
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,043
最近有许多野猪出没
Boar are running thick.

66
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:33,035
我希望你和我一起去打猎
I was hoping you might want to join me on a hunt.

67
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,099
谢谢你的邀请
Thanks for the invite,

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,085
但我们正在准备野餐
but as you can see, we're just about to begin a picnic.

69
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,020
我认为打猎是一种...
Well, I think hunting might be a...

70
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:46,010
很好的方式来消磨你的一天 Charlie
a better way to spend your day, Charlie.

71
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:48,096
我的意思是所有的事中
I mean, of all the things you could choose to do today,

72
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,099
打猎无疑是最佳选择
hunting with me might be your best option.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,091
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

74
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,098
怎么了?
What is it?

75
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,087
我知道怎么离开这座岛了
I think I know how to get us off this island.

Sun! Jin!

79
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,009
Claire 你怎么了?
Claire, what's the matter?

80
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,006
我需要Jin的网和鱼
I need Jin's nets and fish.

81
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,033
我们要快点...还有水桶 我需要那个
We've gotta hurry. And buckets...I'm gonna need those, too.

82
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,002
我们必须抓一只鸟
We have to catch the birds.

83
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,070
他们刚飞过 而且就在这停留一天
They just flew over, and they're only gonna be here today,

84
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,059
所以要捉的话 只有今天
so to catch one, we need to do it now.

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,034
那听起来很有趣
Oh, this sounds like fun.

86
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:44,048
你能弄些网来吗?
Can you get some nets?

87
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:49,047
网用来干嘛Barb...
Nets for what, Barb...

88
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,089
网用来干嘛 Claire?
Nets for what, Claire?

89
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,079
5分钟前 一群海鸟飞过我的头顶
Okay, five minutes ago, a flock of sea birds flew over my head.

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,098
海鸟会迁移
Seabirds are migratory,

91
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,028
他们会继续向南飞
which means they're gonna keep heading south.

92
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,019
抱歉 我还是不明白
I'm sorry. I don't understand why we need to...

93
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,048
他们被挂了标签
They're tagged.

94
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:05,011
标签?
Tagged?

95
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:07,058
科学家给他们做了标签 为了追踪研究他们
Scientists tag these birds so they can track them.

96
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:11,098
如果他们到了澳大利亚或新西兰
So when they eventually land in Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

97
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,047
有人会收集他们的
somebody's gonna gather them up.

98
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,014
如果我们捉住一只
We can send a message.

99
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,045
我们可以靠他们传递消息
If we can catch one.

100
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,045
好了 这是我们的计划
Okay, so here's the plan.

101
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,039
首先把鱼弄碎
First, we've gotta cut up these fish, make chum.

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,036
鸟儿会来觅食的
That'll get the birds to settle in the water.

103
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:26,058
我们要重新布置网
And then, um, we're gonna need to cut up some of this net.

104
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:30,028
Charlie能把刀递给我吗?
Charlie, can you go get some knives?

105
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:33,021
Charlie

106
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,038
Charlie!

107
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,082
是的
Yeah.

108
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,055
你是怎么知道这些的 Claire?
How do you even know this stuff about birds?

109
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,036
那是因为我和妈妈看太多自然节目了
I watched a lot of nature shows with my mum.

110
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:45,072
那也不能让你成为专家啊
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

111
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,055
我只是...
I just...

112
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:52,036
我只是不想让你浪费时间罢了
I don't want to see you wasting your time, that's all.

113
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:57,002
你不是说好"占有"这一天的吗?
So what happened to seizing the day?

114
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,097
抱歉
Sorry.

115
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,043
是我没发现这一点
Don't see the point.

116
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:15,069
稳住了 亲爱的
Hold still, dear.

117
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,038
马上就好
Just another second.

118
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,020
行了
There.

119
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:23,008
没事了
We're through now.

120
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,003
Littleton女士 我是Barnes警官
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

121
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,089
很抱歉打扰您 但我需要问几个问题
Sorry to bother you, but I need to ask you a few questions.

122
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,035
事故是怎么发生的?
Can I ask you how the accident happened?

123
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,037
一辆卡车把我们撞出路面
A truck forced us off the road.

124
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:45,018
谁在驾驶?
Okay, and who was driving?

125
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,075
我
Me.

126
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,040
有人联系你父亲吗?
Has anyone contacted your father?

127
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,026
我2岁时父亲就去世了
My father died when I was 2.

128
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:55,078
很抱歉
Sorry to hear that.

129
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,041
我和卡车司机谈过
I spoke with the truck driver.

130
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,076
他很好
He's fine, by the way.

131
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,037
他说你撞了他...
He said that when you hit him...

132
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:02,055
不 是他撞的我们
No, he hit us.

133
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:05,053
事故发生时你的车速是多少?
About what speed would you say that happened when you were driving?

134
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,060
他突然就冒了出来 我没有...
It just came out of nowhere.

135
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:11,017
你没有回答我的问题 Littleton女士
That's not the question I asked, Ms. Littleton.

136
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:15,033
我不知道当时的车速
I don't know how fast I was driving.

137
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:18,031
你为什么要问这些问题?
Why are you even asking me these questions?

138
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:23,016
抱歉这是程序
These questions are standard procedure when there's a fatality.

139
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:25,071
我母亲在开刀
My mother is in surgery.

140
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,055
她还没死
She's not dead.

141
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,079
是啊
Right.

142
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,076
那就是了
So she is.

143
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:36,002
这不是我的错
You know, this is not my fault!

144
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:37,068
我没有说是你的错
Didn't say it was.

145
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:41,032
祝你有愉快的一天 Littleton女士
Good day, Ms. Littleton.

146
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,079
能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you something?

147
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:12,072
我告诉你你女儿和他们在一起...
I told you that your daughter was living with them...

148
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:15,040
而你竟然没问我一个问题
and you haven't asked me a single question about her.

149
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,033
你没有...
You haven't...

150
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:19,082
你的朋友 Jack
Your friend Jack,

151
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:23,074
你关切他吗?
you care about him?

152
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:26,011
是的
Yes.

153
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,064
设想一下16年后
Imagine 16 years from now,

154
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,094
你被告知他还活着
you're told he's still alive.

155
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:32,056
然而你告诉自己
But in your heart,

156
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:36,007
他可能甚至都不记得你了
you know that he wouldn't remember you.

157
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,023
他根本不认识你了
He wouldn't know you.

158
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,087
那还会了解
Wouldn't even know

159
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:47,009
你关切过他吗?
that you ever cared about him.

160
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:56,036
我没有问你我女儿的事...
I haven't asked you questions about my daughter...

161
00:09:56,037 --> 00:10:02,018
因为我不想知道答案
because I do not want to know the answers.

162
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,028
水?
Water?

163
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,037
不了 谢谢
No, thank you.

164
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,021
你是怎么来这里的?
So how'd you get here?

165
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,077
怎么来到这座岛上的?
How'd you get onto this island?

166
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,051
不要浪费口舌了 他说的都不是真话
Don't waste your breath. Whatever he says will be a lie.

167
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:29,085
24岁是我被招入了新兵
I was recruited when I was 24.

168
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,091
有一个人和我接触...
I was approached by a man...

169
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:33,065
我没有问什么时候 我问你是怎么来的
I didn't ask you when I asked you how.

170
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,091
坐潜水艇来的
They brought me on the submarine.

171
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,078
你们的人...他们能随意进出?
So your people, they can just come and go whenever they want?

172
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,011
去 是的 可两星期以前
Go, yes, but two weeks ago,

173
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:44,099
海底灯标停止接收信号
our underwater beacon stopped emitting its locator signal.

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,059
出了事故...是电磁回路
There was an event...an electromagnetic pulse.

175
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,030
回来就不可能了
It would be impossible to come back.

176
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,065
你为什么想回来?
Why would you want to come back?

177
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:56,089
你不会明白的
You would not understand.

178
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,078
说来听听
Try me.

179
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,068
我不会说的
I misspoke.

180
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,063
我想说的是
What I meant to say is,

181
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,019
你没有理解的能力
you're not capable of understanding.

182
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,066
那又是为什么呢?
And why am I not capable?

183
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,034
Kate

184
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:11,068
因为你不在名单上
Because you are not on the list.

185
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:16,013
什么名单?
What list?

186
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,024
那个把我带来这里的人
The man who brought me here,

187
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,054
和所有来这里的人
who brought all of my people here,

188
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:26,095
他是一个...伟大的人
he is... a magnificent man.

189
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:30,041
如果Ben很伟大 那为什么需要我们中的一个人来救他呢?
If Ben's so magnificent, then why did he need one of us to save him?

190
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:35,075
Ben? Ben不是...
Ben? Ben is not...

191
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:38,076
简单点说
I will try to make this as simple as I can.

192
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:43,059
你们不在名单里 因为你们有瑕疵
You are not on the list because you are flawed

193
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,000
因为你们愤怒
Because you are angry

194
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:50,069
虚弱 恐惧
And weak and frightened.

195
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,026
越了解你们的人
The more I learn about your people,

196
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:56,055
我就越怀疑 你们是不是真的无所不知
the more I suspect you're not as omniscient as you'd have us believe.

197
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,089
别装作你很了解我们
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

198
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,074
我当然不了解你 Sayid Jarrah
Of course I don't know you, Sayid Jarrah.

199
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:04,060
我怎么会呢?
How could I?

200
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:10,058
Kate Austen 你对我来说就是个陌生人
And you, Kate Austen, are a complete stranger to me.

201
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,095
但John Locke 你...我想起来...
But you, John Locke, you, I might have a fleeting memory of,

202
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,040
我一定是糊涂了
but I must be confused,

203
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:21,007
因为我认识的John Locke曾是...
because the John Locke I know was para...

204
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:25,019
来看看这个
Look at this.

205
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:33,024
在这边 快点
Over here. Come on.

206
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:20,009
看来我们到了
Well, looks like we're here.

207
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,089
这能行吗?
Will this work?

208
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,027
是的 能行
Yes. Work.

209
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:40,084
能帮一下Sun的忙吗
Sun Please... Help.

210
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,005
好的
Ok.

211
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,072
真难闻啊
Smells great.

212
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:57,018
我们来处理吧
Let's get it over with.

213
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,077
我妈妈最怕这个了
This was my mother's worst fear.

214
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,083
什么意思?
What do you mean?

215
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:03,051
最后我就干这个
That I would end up doing something very much like this,

216
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:08,007
做诱饵 她对我的期望值很高
cutting bait. She had high hopes for my future.

217
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:13,006
他们也没想到我会嫁给渔夫的儿子
They did not include me marrying a fisherman's son.

218
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:16,061
看来我们都不能实现母亲的愿望了
Well, I guess we don't always turn out like our mothers want.

219
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:22,090
当然 我妈妈从来不做事
Of course, mine never worked a day in her life.

220
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,030
我妈妈曾是个图书管理员
My mom was a librarian.

221
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:33,071
曾是?
Was?

222
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:40,090
我们该干活了
We should get this stuff out there.

223
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:04,082
你去哪儿了?
Where were you?

224
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,040
回家洗了个澡
I went home to take a shower.

225
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,093
那一定很舒服
That must have been nice.

226
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:13,060
他们说她还在手术中
They said she was still in surgery.

227
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:16,018
我也受伤了 Lindsey姑妈
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

228
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:23,062
我很高兴你恢复精神了
Well, I'm glad that you're feeling refreshed.

229
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:28,012
下午好 你是她女儿吗?
Good afternoon. Are you the daughter?

230
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,067
我是Woodrufffrom医生 神经科的
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.

231
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,048
她还要接受几天的观察
I'll be observing your mother for the next few days.

232
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,032
她怎么样?
How is she?

233
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,044
我们设法稳定伤势
We've managed to stabilize her immediate injuries

234
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:41,050
可她头部受到了创伤
But your mother suffered a severe head trauma.

235
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,072
我们要等她头部的肿块消退后
We'll have to wait for the swelling in her brain to go down

236
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:48,062
才能给她做全面的检查
before we can determine the full extent of her injuries.

237
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:54,047
但恐怕她受到了大面积的伤害
But...I'm afraid we're looking at fairly widespread damage.

238
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:56,014
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

239
00:15:56,015 --> 00:16:01,066
意思是她的生命要靠这些仪器维持
It means that right now these machines are sustaining her life.

240
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,049
但不会一直...
But it won't always be...

241
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,098
当她醒来 她不会...
I mean, when she wakes up, she won't...

242
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:09,077
我不能很肯定的告诉你
I can't say with any real confidence

243
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:14,092
她会醒过来
that she will wake up.

244
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,088
她能听见我们吗?
Can she hear us?

245
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,085
我希望是这样
I like to think she can.

246
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:33,019
她这样要多久?
How long will she be like this?

247
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,063
也许一天 一个星期或是一年
Could be a day, a week or years.

248
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:38,027
我们只能等待
We'll just have to wait and see.

249
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,084
但我能保证你们她会受到很好的照顾的
But I can assure you, she'll be well looked after.

250
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:44,070
那很好 只是我们付不起那么多
Oh, that's very nice, but we can't pay for that.

251
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:51,044
别担心 有人已经帮你们解决了
Don't worry. Her expenses have already been taken care of.

252
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,086
是谁?
By whom?

253
00:16:54,087 --> 00:17:00,098
他让我保密
I've been asked to keep that confidential.

254
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:25,004
1... 2...
One... Two...

255
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:32,030
不!
No!

256
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:37,081
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

257
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,078
我很抱歉 伙计
I'm sorry, man.

258
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,010
我很抱歉
I said I'm sorry.

259
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:42,012
你到底想干什么?
What the hell is wrong with you?

260
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,066
我在打一只野猪 我不知道你们在这里
I was shooting at a boar. I had no idea you were out here.

261
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,008
Charlie在哪里?
Where's Charlie?

262
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:47,068
他在营地里
He's back at the camp.

263
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,025
我很抱歉吓到了你们...
I'm really sorry if I frightened...

264
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,012
所以就你一个人?
So it's just you?

265
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:56,077
你就正好出现在我们设陷阱的地方?
Hunting, in the exact same spot as we're setting our trap?

266
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,079
我在追一头野猪 Claire
I was following a boar, Claire.

267
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,003
那可真是巧啊
So it's just a coincidence, then.

268
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:05,090
那头猪呢?
Where is it?

269
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:10,005
它跑了
It got away.

270
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:15,086
你不想让我捉住那只鸟是吗?
You don't want me to catch the birds, do you?

271
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:19,058
你和Charlie 到底怎么了?
You and Charlie..what's going on?

272
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:25,049
我为什么不想你捉住它?
Why wouldn't I want you to catch the birds?

273
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,043
这是什么?
What is it?

274
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,098
别碰它!
Don't touch it!

275
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:45,001
别靠近它
Don't even get near it.

276
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,028
这些高压电线架是什么?
What are these pylons?

277
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,099
你认为呢?
What do you think they are?

278
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,059
一种区域防御系统
A security perimeter.

279
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,034
任何人走进去时
Those sensors on the side would be triggered

280
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:06,032
就会触发陷阱
if anyone passed between them.

281
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:09,031
这是警报系统或是陷阱
It's an alarm system or a trap.

282
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,056
我们在这里会很安全
Either way, we'll be safer going around it.

283
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:15,028
你是对的 这是个防御系统
You are right. It was a security perimeter,

284
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,071
但经过这么多年想必这些都已经失效了
but like everything else on this island, it hasn't functioned in years.

285
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:22,040
别耍我们了
Of course it hasn't.

286
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,032
如果你想浪费时间 随便你
If you wish to waste your time, be my guest.

287
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:28,036
电线架围绕着整个营地
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

288
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:30,077
你们这样是进不去的
There is no going around them.

289
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:36,005
如果你不相信我的话 看看你的地图
If you don't believe me, look at your map.

290
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:52,050
看来他说的是真的
He appears to be telling the truth.

291
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:57,061
John? John!

292
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,024
谢谢你
Thank you.

293
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:29,095
我的上帝
Oh, my god.

294
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,010
抱歉
Sorry.

295
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,044
看上去像大脑出血
Looks like he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.

296
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:51,058
你为什么要这样做?我们需要他!
Why did you do that? We needed him!

297
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,007
他们不会拿他交换Jack的
They were never gonna trade him for Jack.

298
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,058
-你不知道的  -那你也不知道
-You don't know that.  -You don't know it, either.

299
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,004
我们知道的是 他射杀了他的同伴
What we do know is that he shot one of his own people who didn't want to be in this exact situation,

300
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,025
所以我坚持我的想法
so I'm gonna stick with my opinion.

301
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:04,049
我们至少能讨论一下
We could have discussed it.

302
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,009
我们本来就不该带上他
Nobody asked me about it when we brought him along in the 1st place.

303
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,037
行了
All right.

304
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:14,026
抱歉我不知道他们有某种电磁武器系统
Pardon me for not knowing that they had a sonic weapon fence.

305
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:16,098
我不知道他会死
I didn't know he was gonna die. How would I know that?

306
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,040
你来的目的是什么?
Why are you really here?

307
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,092
是为了Jack吗?
Are you here for Jack?

308
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,079
那还有什么原因?
Why else would I be here?

309
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:27,041
这事我们稍后再解决
We'll talk about this later.

310
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:29,015
我同意
Fine by me.

311
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:30,045
那我们怎么穿过去?
Just tell me how we're gonna go through this.

312
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:32,037
我们另找办法
We're not gonna go through it.

313
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:34,084
我们翻过去
We're going over it.

314
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,089
Sayid, 斧头放在哪了?
Sayid, where's the axe?

315
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,043
在他的背包里
It's in his pack.

316
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:39,061
等等 我来拿
No, wait a minute. I got it.

317
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:41,090
我来吧
Here, I got it.

318
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:55,062
我认为你原来不知道有C-4的
I thought you didn't know there was any c-4.

319
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:58,050
好吧 我承认
Well, I stand corrected.

320
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,081
你为什么带上它?
Why did you take it?

321
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:04,035
你永远不知道小小的C-4也许能派上用处
You never know when a little c-4 might come in handy.

322
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:07,061
你必须做的更好
You'll have to do better than that.

323
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:19,081
好了好了
Okay, there you go.

324
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:22,086
你到底怎么了 Charlie?
What's going on with you, Charlie?

325
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,067
我只是把Aaron放下
I just put Aaron down

326
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:28,009
不 你和Desmond 怎么了?
No, you and Desmond, what's going on?

327
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,010
我不知道你在说什么
What you're talking about.

328
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:34,018
那你不知道Desmond开枪吓跑了我们要捉的鸟吗?
So you don't know anything about Desmond shooting off 
his gun and scaring away the birds?

329
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,027
我早上一直和Aaron在一起
I've been with Aaron all morning.

330
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,038
你在撒谎 Charlie
You're lying to me, Charlie.

331
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,005
我没有
I am not lying.

332
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,075
那个早上醒来
What happened to the guy who woke up this morning

333
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,036
准备野餐的家伙到底怎么了?
who wanted to go and have a picnic and seize the day?

334
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:49,020
你真的想知道?
You really want to know the truth?

335
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,010
那闪光会是任何东西
That glint you saw could have been anything

336
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:54,067
粘在鸟爪子上的玻璃残渣
a piece of glass stuck in the bird's foot...

337
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:57,061
或许什么都没有
or it could have been nothing at all.

338
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:03,007
我不想让你有错误的希望 Claire
I don't want to advocate false hope, Claire, that's all.

339
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:07,046
很抱歉 我想到这个主意
Well, I'm sorry. I bothered you with my stupid ideas,

340
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,008
这永远都不会再发生了
and, it won't ever happen again.

341
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:11,044
Charlie 我不想我的孩子围绕在谎言之中
And, Charlie, I don't want my baby around lies.

342
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:13,008
你是反应过度了
I think you might be overreacting.

343
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,006
反应过度?
Overreacting?

344
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:18,049
不 我以为我能和你在一起 我能依赖你
No, I thought you were here for me, that I could count on you.

345
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,031
但我错了
I was wrong.

346
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,019
不 Claire
No, Claire!

347
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,076
我还是靠我自己吧 至少现在我意识到了
I'm on my own, and at least I know that now.

348
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,041
Claire

349
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,090
走吧!
Just go!

350
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:37,046
早上好 亲爱的
Morning, dear.

351
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:39,027
我喜欢你新的医生
Oh, I like your new doctor.

352
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,046
新的医生?
What new doctor?

353
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:41,080
是个美国人
Oh, the American.

354
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:44,076
现在和你母亲在一起
He's in with your mum now.

355
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,063
不好意思
Excuse me.

356
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:10,026
护士说
The nurse said

357
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,084
你是医生?
Are you a doctor?

358
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,076
是的
Yes

359
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,030
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

360
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:25,055
打扰你们
I shouldn't be disturbing you.

361
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,070
我该走了
I was just leaving.

362
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,099
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

363
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,043
我才要走 Lindsey
I was just on my way out, Lindsey.

364
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:33,009
如果Carole知道你在这里...
If Carole knew you were here...

365
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,053
怎么? 她会做什么?
She'd what? What would she do?

366
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:37,091
她不会表现的像你那样
She wouldn't be acting the way you are.

367
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:40,092
Lindsey姨妈 到底怎么回事?
Aunt Lindsey, what's going on here?

368
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:43,021
他是谁?
Who is he?

369
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,072
这不重要 你走吧
It doesn't matter. Just go.

370
00:24:45,073 --> 00:24:48,009
或许你应该告诉她 Lindsey
Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.

371
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:50,087
求你就别管我们了
Please, just leave us alone.

372
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:53,071
-你没有资格来决定这些  -不
-You are not the arbiter here.  -No.

373
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:56,048
-在这种情况下  -你是趁我姐姐受伤的机会
-In these circumstances  -You are taking advantage of my sister's situation

374
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,011
我不认为Claire有权知道...
I believe Claire has every right to know...

375
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,058
大家冷静一下!
just stop it!

376
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,058
是你付的医疗费?
Are you the one paying the bills?

377
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,081
是你照料这些事的?
Are you the one taking care of all this?

378
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:11,089
是的
Yes.

379
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,029
那你是谁?
Then who are you?

380
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,068
我是你的父亲 Claire
I'm your father, Claire.

381
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:06,088
如果有东西切断了系统的水平面
The system appears to fire a sonic pulse

382
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,055
那就会触发电磁回路
when an object breaks the plane between two pylons.

383
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:11,068
所以
So...

384
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,037
只要我们不去碰那个水平面 我们就会没事的
as long as we don't break the plane, we should remain unharmed.

385
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,044
为什么不用炸药呢?
Why not just use the plastic explosive you took?

386
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:20,024
你想死就随便你
Be my guest. You wanna go stick it on there?

387
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:23,068
谁爬过去后 给一个安全信号
Whoever climbs over, give those sensors a wide berth.

388
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,021
我先来
I'll go first.

389
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,077
帮我一把
Give me a hand.

390
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,088
我想我是第二个
I guess I'll go next.

391
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,038
行了
Here you go.

392
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,058
谢谢
Thanks.

393
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,094
不要为那事烦心了
You have every right to be upset.

394
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,046
这一点都没道理
It just doesn't make any sense.

395
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:23,024
Desmond从没打过野猪
Desmond's never gone boar hunting before,

396
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,029
而野猪也不会那么靠近海滩
and the boar never come that close to the beach.

397
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,087
不管发生了什么
Well, whatever is going on,

398
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,068
他们还在那边说话呢
they're still talking about it.

399
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,063
你能看一下他吗?
Can you watch him?

400
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:41,003
你要去干什么?
What are you going to do?

401
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,034
找出答案
Get some answers.

402
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:53,039
一会儿就来
I'll be with you in a sec.

403
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:59,006
行了
There you go.

404
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:01,067
10块钱
It'll be 10 bucks.

405
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:13,092
你来这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

406
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:16,083
请你喝杯咖啡?
Buy you a cup of coffee?

407
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,049
我和你没什么好说的
I have nothing to say to you.

408
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,088
Claire今晚我就离开 从此我会从你的生活中消失的
I'm leaving tonight, then I'll be out of your life forever.

409
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:28,043
就一杯咖啡
Just one cup of coffee.

410
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:38,008
这都是真的
So it's true.

411
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:42,030
是的
Yes, it's true.

412
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:49,062
你是怎么知道发生事故了?
How'd you find out about the accident?

413
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:51,049
一个在悉尼的朋友告诉我的
A doctor friend here in Sydney told me.

414
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,092
你母亲一进手术室我就接到了电话
I got the call the minute your mother went into surgery.

415
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:01,045
为什么她告诉我你死了?
Why did she tell me that you're dead?

416
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:08,019
是因为我和她在一起留下了许多美好的时光吧
Well, because I..no doubt...left her with so many wonderful memories.

417
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:12,078
我们有段美妙的时光
Look, we had a fling.

418
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,072
我回络杉矶后她才告诉我她怀孕了
I was back in Los Angeles when she told me that she was pregnant,

419
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:18,053
她将有个还孩子 你
that she was going to have the baby...have you.

420
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:21,018
你不想见我?
You didn't want to see me?

421
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,067
不 在你小的时候我来看过你几次
No. I came out a bunch of times when you were little.

422
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:29,089
我过来买玩具给你
I stayed over,gave you toys.

423
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,064
给你唱歌
I sang to you.

424
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:37,016
为什么你后来不来了呢?
Why'd you stop coming?

425
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:40,009
因为你的姨妈恨我
'cause your aunt hates me,

426
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,078
而你母亲不愿意接受
and your mother didn't like the fact that...

427
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,033
我有另外一个家庭的现实
I had another family.

428
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:47,061
那你现在来做什么?
Why are you here now, then? Why'd you come?

429
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,093
就为了给我们付医疗费?
You could've just paid her bills from the states.

430
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:53,006
我来是想帮助你们
I came over because I wanted to help.

431
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,045
帮助什么?
Help with what?

432
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:59,089
Claire 你母亲还活着
Your mother is alive...

433
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:04,006
但基本上是个植物人
but she's not really living.

434
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,035
你到底什么意思?
What that's supposed to mean?

435
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:09,046
意思是是时候选择
It means that now may be the time

436
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,039
其它的道路来减轻她的痛苦
to look at other alternatives, other ways to relieve her pain.

437
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,009
撤掉她身上的仪器是非法的
Now it is illegal to turn off her machines,

438
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,033
但我知道一种合法的办法
but I know of ways that can achieve the same effect without the legal consequences.

439
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,095
闭嘴!
Just stop it!

440
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:23,023
你不是来帮我的
You didn't come here to help me.

441
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:25,088
你是来弥补自己的过失的
You came here to try and fix a mistake that you made.

442
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,092
不 亲爱的 不是这样的
No, honey, that's not true.

443
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:30,067
你以为付了医疗费就能让你变成一个高尚的人吗?
You think that just paying her bills makes you noble or something?

444
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:36,002
你来这里是想杀死她?
You come down here, and you try and get me to kill her?

445
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,086
你走吧
You know, just go.

446
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,074
为什么你不走呢?
Why don't you just go?

447
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:44,088
回到你真实的家庭去
Go back to your real family.

448
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,072
你知道
You know

449
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:53,066
你也许是我的父亲
You might be my father

450
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,093
但我甚至都不知道你的名字
But I don't even know your name...

451
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:03,092
而我也不想知道
And I, um, I want it to stay that way.

452
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,037
Claire...Claire

453
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:06,048
Claire听我说
Listen to me.

454
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,064
听我说
Listen to me.

455
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:12,023
别让你母亲以错误的原因活下去
Do not keep your mother alive for the wrong reasons.

456
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:15,083
希望还是罪责 相信我
Now there is hope and there is guilt, and believe me,

457
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:19,015
我知道这的区别
I know the difference.

458
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,018
再见了 孩子
Good-bye, kiddo.

459
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,090
很高兴再次见到你
It's great seeing you again.

460
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:16,005

463
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:23,027

465

你怎么知道会在这里的?
How did you know it was gonna be here?

466
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,089
我不知道
I didn't.

467
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,047
是的 你知道
Yes, you did.

468
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:50,018

这就是你和Charlie争执的事情

我怎么会知道?
How would I?

472
00:33:58,023 --> 00:34:01,063
你不去任何地方找
I don't know, but you know,you walked straight here

473
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:04,009
就径直来到这里
no doubt at all about where you were going.

474
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,018
在这片海滩这块石头
You came right to this beach and right to this rock,

475
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:11,072
而且很巧的是 这有只鸟
and low and behold, there's the bird.

476
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:16,053
到底发生了什么 Desmond?
What t hell is going on, Desmond?

477
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:26,067
看见那块地方了吗?
See that spot over there?

478
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,016
那就是Charlie滑倒的地方
That's where Charlie slipped and fell in.

他撞在石头上
He got pounded again and again by the rocks and

摔断了他的脖子

481
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,046
什么?
What?

482
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:44,091

Desmond把一切都告诉我了
Desmond told me everything

489
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:23,081
那些幻觉
about all his visions

490

他知道你会被电击
That he knew you were gonna get hit by lightning,

491
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,005
为了救我你会淹死

492
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:42,008
为了捉这只鸟 你摔死了
how you died trying to get me this bird.

493
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,031
你不会相信的 是吧?
You don't believe all that, do you?

494
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:11,043
谁把电视关了?
Now who turned the telly off?

495
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,095
他们不知道我妈妈喜欢看自然节目吗?
Don't they know how much you love your nature shows?

496
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:19,091
这样好多了
That's better.

497
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:25,021
妈妈 你今天怎么样?
So how are you today, mum?

独自把我抚养大的

508
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:38,015
一定很艰难
That must have been so hard,

509

让你操心了
So horrible to you.

513
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:58,016

说我不希望你是我的母亲
and that I wished you weren't my mother

518
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:27,060
说我希望你死

519
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,010
都是我的错
It's all my fault

520
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:34,098

525
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:06,059
我们是815航班的幸存者
To whom it may concern,we are survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

527
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:15,059
起飞后6小时
We were six hours into the flight when the pilot said we were off course

528
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,037

我们尽力在岛上生存下来

有些人已经接受了没人救援的现实
