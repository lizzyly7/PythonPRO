你需要一个父亲而我需要一个肾
You needed a father and I needed a kidney,

8
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:17,026
这就是现实
and that's what happened.

忘了它吧
Get over it.

10
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:19,084
我不在乎Jack怎么说
I don't care what Jack said.

11
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,031
我们必须救他回来这是我欠他的
They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that.

12
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,067
你是怎么来这座岛的?
How did you get onto this island?

13
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,028
他们有一艘潜艇
They brought me on the submarine.

14
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,058
你们的人可以自由的来去吗?
So your people, they can just come and go whenever they want?

15
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,024
你永远不会知道一颗C4也能派上用处
You never know when a little c4 might come in handy.

16
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,034
姓名?

没有
No

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,055
你的父母还活着吗?
Are your parents living?

23
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:03,025
我是被领养的 我从来没见过自己的父母
I was raised in foster care.I never really knew my parents.

24
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:08,031
你有没有想过 要寻找自己的亲生父母?
Have you ever considered seeking out your biological parents?

25
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,085
我认为这并不重要
I don't see how that's relevant.

26
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:14,019
这很重要Locke先生 因为如果政府要
It's relevant, Mr. Locke,because if the government's

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,082
继续支付你的残疾保险的话
gonna continue paying your disability insurance,

28
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:20,071
那我就要知道你的情况 是否有所改善
I have to figure out whether or not your condition has improved.

29
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:25,076
那么...你的胃口怎么样?
So... How's your appetite?

30
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,086
很好
Fine.

31
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,068
我发现你已经 停止支付你的医疗帐单了
I see you stopped submitting your therapy bills for reimbursement.

32
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,025
因为我已经不去了
It's 'cause I stopped going.

33
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,079
那只是浪费时间
Waste of time.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,010
这只是临时的 Locke先生(停止残疾人保险)
It's just a temporary suspension,Mr. Locke.

35
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,046
一旦你重新接受治疗 你可以再来申请
As soon as you resume your sessions,you can reapply.

36
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,025
你认为我是暂时的残疾?
You think I'm temporarily disabled?

37
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,071
沮丧是暂时的 所以是的
Depression can be temporary, yes.

38
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:56,097
停止接受治疗真是明智之举
And since you see fit to stop going to therapy,I guess you're all better.

39
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:02,074
我猜是这样的
Guess I am.

40
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,017

好身手!
Good hands!

44
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,054

00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,029
怎么了?

这比我们想象的要复杂的多
This is gonna be more complicated than we thought.

53
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:14,001
我们就这样冲进去吗?
So you saying, we simply start shooting people and hope for the best?

54
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,026
我们是来救Jack的 现在可以行动了
We came here to rescue Jack,and we're gonna do it.

55
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,016
很明显情况有所改变
But obviously the circumstances have changed.

56
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,029
-他也许不想回来了  -那不是他
-He may not want to be rescued.  -That is not him.

57
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,066
那不是Jack
That's not Jack.

58
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,085
他们一定对他做了什么 我们被抓时也被下了药
They must have done some thing to him.When they captured us, they drugged us.

59
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:27,096
-他好像很清醒的样子  -他们绑架了他 把他当作囚犯
-He didn't appear to be drugged.  -They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.

60
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,072
-他是不会忘记的  -我同意
-He wouldn't just forget that.  -I agree,

61
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:32,009
但在没弄清楚前 我们不能冒生命危险
but until we know why,we're putting our lives at risk.

62
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,022
我不会留下他不管的 Sayid
I'm not leaving him, Sayid.

63
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,014
-我们还有选择  -这就是Jack
-We may not have a choice.  -It's Jack.

64
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,042
第一次见到他时 他冒着生命危险
The first time I saw him,he was risking his life

65
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:43,063
把受伤的人拖出飞机的残骸
pulling people out of burning airplane wreckage.

66
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:46,094
如果他现在和"the others"握手的话 我相信他有自己的理由
If he's shaking hands with the others,I'm sure he has a good reason.

67
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:50,095
我们只须过去查个究竟
We just have to go down there and find out what it is.

68
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,020
你有什么建议?
What do you suggest?

69
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,096
等天黑的时候 当Jack一个人时我们过去...
We wait till it's dark.We approach Jack when he's alone...

70
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:03,017
如果他想回来 我们就把他弄出来
And if he wants out, we get him out.

71
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,072
这就是我们所知道的
Here's what we know, Crystal.

72
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:10,032
昨晚两点左右 那笔玻利维亚的保险金被盗了
The bolivian coal deposits were stolen last night around 2:00 a.m.

73
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,096
那就意味着"眼镜蛇"又回来了
Oh, that means the cobra...he's back.

74
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,049
他被击中了吗?
Has he been shot?

75
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,050
我找不到他
I can't find him!

76

他有武器 我动不了了
He's armed! I can't get up!

77
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:29,015
你好 你是John Locke?

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,050
抱歉 谢绝推销
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

79
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,028
-有门上有标志  -我不是想要卖...

80
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:37,041
听着 我叫Peter Talbot
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

81
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,044
我只想和你谈谈
I just need a couple minutes to talk to you.

82
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,076
关于什么?
Talk about what?

83
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:43,062
实际上 是我的母亲
My mother, actually.

84
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:45,038
我认为她和你遇到了同样的麻烦
I think she might be in some trouble.

85
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,093
我不是你要找的John Locke
You got the wrong John Locke.

86
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:49,056
你有几个肾脏?
How many kidneys do you have?

87
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,021
她是两个月前认识他的
She met him two months ago.

88
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,066
"一见钟情" 她是这样说的
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

89
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:01,028
那人很有魅力 很幽默
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

90
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,097
他叫Adam Seward
His name's Adam Seward.

91
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:06,076
他是一个从安大略湖来的退休电脑承包商
He's a retired computer entrepreneur from Ontario.

92
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,008
Adam很特别
Anyway, Adam had something... special.

93
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,002
没过多久 我母亲就为他着迷了
My mom just went gaga for him right out of the gate.

94
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:18,027
在认识他两个月后 她答应嫁给他
After two months of knowing him,she agree to marry the guy.

95
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,094
而他的一些事情...
And something about him...

96
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,052
我认为他另有所图
Something in my gut told me that he was after something,

97
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,037
所以我就开始调查他
so I had to check him out.

98
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:30,003
我还是不知道 这和我有什么关系
Well, I'm not sure I know what any of this has to do with me.

99
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:33,071
这和你的确有关系 Locke先生
Well, what this has to do with you, Mr. Locke,

100
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:37,049
因为你捐了一个肾脏给Adam Seward
is that you donated one of your kidneys to Adam Seward,

101
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,061
只是那时他的名字不同罢了
only his name was different back then.

102
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,063
他曾用过"Anthony Cooper"这个名字
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

103
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:52,014
我能找到的只有他的医疗记录
All I could find were his medical records,

104
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,016
我发现了他是一个肾脏移植的
and I saw that he was the recipient

105
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:57,089
接受者 当然是从你那里
of a kidney transplant from You.

106
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,012
我想 他骗走了别人的肾脏
So I figured, hey,someone gave the guy his kidney.

107
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,024
那该有多糟啊
How bad could he be?

108
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:06,004
是吗?
Right?

109
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,079
那是一个匿名捐赠
Well, it..it was an anonymous donation.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
我从来没见过他
I never met him.

111
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,078
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

112
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,067
我很抱歉我帮不了你
Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

113
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,038
Sayid你守着前面
Sayid, you guard the front.

114
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,091
我到后面去掩护
I'll go around and cover the back.

115
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,039
你从侧门进去
You head in through the side door.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,043
就我一个人进去?
I'm going in alone?

117
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,099
他第一个见到你更好
It's better if you're the first one he sees.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,001
好吧
All right.

119
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,076
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

120
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,063
我是来救你的
I came to get you.

121
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,035
马上离开这里
Get out of here

122

Kate 他们在监视我!

124
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,010
-快离开这里!  -我不会离开你的
-Get out of here!  -I'm not leaving you.

125
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,064
-是的 你快走!  -趴下! 趴下!
-Yes, you are!  -Get down!

126
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,023
别伤害她!
Don't hurt her!

127
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,066
退后 医生

00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,005
回答他的问题 Kate
Just answer the question, Kate.

132
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:25,059
再给你一次机会,还有谁?
Okay, one more time--who else is with you?

133
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,067
没人了
Nobody.

134
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,025
没人了 就我们两个
Nobody else. It was just us.

135
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:11,043
小声点
Keep your voice down.

136
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,056
好吧
All right.

137
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,086

那艘潜艇
The submarine...

它在哪儿?
where is it?

144
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,036
我不知道你在说什么 John
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

145
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,044
什么潜艇?
What submarine?

153
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:01,025
Ben 你醒了吗?
Ben, you awake?

154
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:09,076
我要进来了
I'm coming in.

155
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,079
什么事?
What is it?

156
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,076
是Austen和Jarrah
It's Austen and Jarrah.

157
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:17,094
他们在这里他们找到我们了
They're here. Somehow they found us.

158
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:19,026
他们现在在哪里?
Where are they now?

159
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:21,081
我们把他们关押在我的地方
We captured them.We're holding 'em over at my place.

160
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:23,005
要我帮你...
Want me to help you get out...

161
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,053
不 把他们分开 我要知道他们是怎么找到我们的
Separate them.I want to know how they found us.

162
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,035
那Juliet和Shepard呢?
What about Juliet and Shepard?

163
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,042
-明天...  -你别操心了 走吧
-Tomorrow...  -Let me worry about that. Just go.

164
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,017
好吧
Got it.

165
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,047
Richard 等一下
Richard, wait a minute.

166
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,048
我在外面等你
I'll wait outside.

167
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,056
我要你把从Tallahassee来的人带来
I want you to bring me the man from Tallahassee.

168
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:47,035
-你要他做什么?  -照做就是了
-What do you need him for?  -Just do it. Now.

169
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:49,036
好吧
All right.

170
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:00,012
"从tallahassee来的人"? 这是什么
"The man from Tallahassee"? What is that

171
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,022
一种暗号吗?
Some kind of code?

172
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:03,052
不 John 我们没有
No,John,unfortunately,we don't have a code

173
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:06,088
"有个男人在衣橱里用枪指着我女儿"这种暗号
for"there's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head,"

174
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,056
很明显 我们应该有的
although we obviously should.

175
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,024
Sayid身上有个背包
He had a pack with him.

176
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:16,079
我要她帮我拿来
I want her to retrieve it.

177
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,029
好的
Okay.

178
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,095
但你应该知道John 我女儿最近很恨我
But you should know,John,my daughter currently hates me,

179
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:24,035
我不认为用她做人质 是明智的选择
so I'm not sure holding me hostage is your best option...

180
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,036
爸爸!
Dad!

181
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,012
我会帮你去拿的
I'll get your bag.

182
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:42,053
我在找那种惊艳的
I'm looking for something really stunning,

183
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,058
能吸引所有人眼球的那种
something that would grab everyone's attention on the table.

184
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,008
亲爱的 你觉得这朵怎么样?
Honey? What do you think of this one?

185
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:52,024
这看上去不错 你认为呢?
Oh, it looks good. What do you think?

186
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:55,045
我也很喜欢 但是是不是太大了
I like it.Maybe just a little larger.

187
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:02,093
还是大点的好
Larger would be good.

188
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,068
我去那边看看
I'll go over there and take a look.

189
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,035
你好 John
Hello, John.

190
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:17,073
你最近有喜事要办?
Gonna be a big to-do or just the two of you and a preacher?

191
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:21,019
我猜你不会邀请我的 因为当你介绍我时...
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?That would make for...

192
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,048
会很尴尬的
awkward introductions.

193
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,069
你是怎么知道我...
How did you even know that I...

194
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,099
那是因为她儿子告诉我的
I know because her son came to me

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,004
还问我 我是怎么给你我的肾脏的
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

196
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:32,010
他知道你不怀好意 只是还没有证据
He's on to you,but he doesn't have any proof.

197
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:35,066
所以他来找我 让我作证
So he came to me hoping I would vouch for you.

198
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,014
你和他说了什么?
What did you say to him?

199
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,070
你在欺骗她 不是吗?
You're conning her, aren't you?

200
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,052
你和她结婚是为了她的钱
You're gonna marry her for her money, right?

201
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,027
你想干什么John?
What is it you want, John?

202
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,045
我要你结束这一切
I want you to end it.

203
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,063
我要你取消婚礼
I want you to call off the wedding.

204
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,059
你为什么要这样做?
Why are you doing this?

205
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,053
因为这不公平
Because it's not fair.

206
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:01,086
你让他们信任你
You make people think that you're their family,

207
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,078
然后逃之夭夭 还毁了他们的生活
and then you leave their life in ruins,

208
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,020
我是不会让你再这么做的
and I'm not gonna let you do it again.

209
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:11,015
你必须取消婚礼 然后离开
You're gonna call off your engagement and go,

210
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,093
否则我就告诉她真相
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

211
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,025
我想听你自己说出来
I want to hear you say it.

212
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,077
你说你会离开的
You say you're gonna leave.

213
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:29,014
好吧 John
Okay, John.

214
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,049
我会的
You got it.

215
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,017
能帮我拿一下轮椅吗?
Would you mind helping me get into my chair?

216
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:53,011
我保证不耍花招
No tricks, I promise.

217
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:57,066
我只想得到些尊严
I just want some dignity.

218
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,028
你应该比任何人都明白我的意思吧
You of all people should understand what it means to want some dignity.

219
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,044
谢谢你
Thank you.

220
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:18,079
告诉我 John
So tell me, John,

221
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,097
你想怎么驾驶那潜艇?
how do you expect to pilot our submarine?

222
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:23,092
那是个很复杂的机械设备
I mean, it's a complicated piece of machinery.

223
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,052
不单单就是按"潜入"这么简单
You don't just press "submerge."

224
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:28,020
我会想办法的
I'll figure something out.

225
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:32,019
你知道 我曾是海军长官
For all you know,I was a commander in the navy.

226
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:38,049
抓住我的脖子 我来帮你起来
Put your arm around my neck.I'll lift under your knees.

227
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,089
那个包里是什么 John?
What's in the pack, John?

228
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,017
如果你见到了Mikhail 那就意味着你...
If you've met Mikhail, that means

229
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,068
去过那个通讯站...
you were in the communications station...

230
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,077
你就会找到炸药
Which means you found the explosives.

231
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,071
你不是想驾驶那潜艇离开这里 对吗?
So you're not planning to pilot the submarine anywhere, are you?

232
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:59,039
你是想炸毁它
You're planning to destroy it.

233
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:04,077
我了解你 John Locke
I know you, John Locke.

234
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:10,043
你什么都不知道
You don't know me at all.

235
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:14,019
我知道你在加州出生
I know you were born in California.

236
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:17,055
然后被领养
I know you were raised in foster care.

237
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:20,050
你在Tustin浪费了很多时间
I know you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin

238
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:24,066
只是在一个盒子公司里消磨自己的人生
pushing papers at a company that manufactured industrial boxes.

239
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,080
我还知道 在你没来这座岛的前四年间
I know you spent the four years

240
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:31,076
一直是靠坐轮椅的
prior to your arrival on this island in a wheelchair.

241
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,027
而且我知道是什么让你坐上那轮椅的
And I know how you ended up in it.

242
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
告诉我 John...
Tell me, John...

243
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,068
你痛苦吗?
Did it hurt?

244
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,094
我感到我的背被撕开了
I felt my back break.

245
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,020
你认为呢?
What do you think?

246
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:30,082
没想到那么快又见面了 Kate
I didn't think I'd see you again so soon, Kate.

247
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,052
小心点
Be careful in here.

248
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,017
谢谢
Thanks.

249
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,042
他们伤害你了吗?
Did they hurt you?

250
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,013
没有
No

251
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,014
你呢?
Did they hurt you?

252
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,090
没有
No

253
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
这些都是什么?
What is all this?

254
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:17,024
这就是他们住的地方
This is where they live.

255
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,030
那他们抓的人呢?
And the people they took?

256
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,007
孩子们呢?
The kids?

257
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:25,008
他们都很安全
They're all safe.

258
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:29,073
"安全"?
"Safe"?

259
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:37,003
你和他们现在是一伙的吗?
So you're with them now?

260
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:42,000
我不属于任何一方 Kate
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

261
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:47,079
他们对你做了什么?
What did they do to you?

262
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
-什么都没有  -那你为什么要这样?
-Nothing.  -Then why are you acting like this?

263
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:53,055
没有办法...
There's no way...

264
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,009
你...我没办法...
You... There's no way that I could...

265
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,026
我是来帮你的
I came here to help you!

266
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,036
你为什么不告诉我...
So why don't you tell me...

267
00:19:57,037 --> 00:20:00,059
我告诉你不要回来找我
I told you not to come back here for me.

268
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,063
我不认为你是真心的
I didn't think you meant it.

269
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,040
他们对你做了什么 Jack?
What did they do to you, Jack?

270
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,053
我和他们做了笔交易
I made a deal with them.

271
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,065
他们会放我走的
They're gonna let me go.

272
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,056
去哪儿?
Where?

273
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,045
回家
Home.

274
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:12,063
什么时候?
When?

275
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,014
早晨的第一件事
First thing in the morning.

276
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,055
我会去找救援的 这是唯一的机会
I can bring back help.It's our best chance.

277
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:20,081
你相信这些人?
You trust these people?

278
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:22,040
他们是骗子 你为什么会相信...
They are liars. Why would you believe...

279
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,085
当你求我救Swayer的时候
I trust them because you told me to, Kate...

280
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,055
是你让我相信他们的 Kate
When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.

281
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,047
他们和你说了什么?
What did they tell you?

282
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:49,025
Jack 我们要走了
Jack, we need to go.

283
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:53,083

I'll be right there.

284
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:06,010
我让你不要回来找我 我也希望...
I asked you not to come back here for me, and I wish...

286
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:19,069
但我一定会回来找你的
But I will come back here for you.

287
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:55,025
John Locke?

288
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,087
Mason探长
Detective Mason.

289
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:59,051
这位是Reed探长 介意我们问你几个问题吗?
That's detective Reed. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?

290
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:00,054
当然不
No, of course not.

291
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,048
你认识一个叫Peter Talbot的人吗?
Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

292
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:07,048
不 我不认识
No, I don't think so.

293
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,040
偏瘦 棕色头发 大约20岁
Thin, brown hair, 20.

294
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:14,078
我们知道两天前他来过你的公寓
If it'll be helpful,we believe he was here in your apartment two days ago.

295
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:17,020
是的 他是个推销员
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

296
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,005
我把他轰走了
I sent him away.

297
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:23,074
Talbot先生家的资产有大约200万
Mr.Talbot's family is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million.

298
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:26,076
我很好奇 他怎么会去做推销员呢?
So I'm curious. What exactly was he selling you door-to-door?

299
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:28,096
我告诉过你了 我不认识他
Well, I...Look, I told you I don't know him.

300
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:33,014
那为什么他口袋里的纸上写着你的地址呢?
Then why was your name and address on a piece of paper in his pocket?

301
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,038
你们为什么会找他的口袋?
Why were you... would you be looking through his pockets?

302
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,095
因为Peter Talbot's已经死了
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

303
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:49,025
这不容易...
It wasn't easy, you know...

304
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,075
整天和你在你的舱里...
Being in that hatch with you all that time...

305
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:55,065
你总是走来走去
Knowing you had no business walking around,

306
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:59,062
如果我不告诉你我的真实身份 就连问你的资格都没有
knowing I couldn't even ask you about it without telling you who I really was.

307
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,063
现在你可以问我了...
So ask me now...

308
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,048
我已经知道你的真实身份了
Now that I know who you really are.

309
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,064
那很快吗?
Was it immediate?

310
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:14,059
你一来这个地方就开始了吗?
It started the moment you got here?

311
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,095
你就这样能走路了 就像人生的回归
And you were just walking,the feeling returned

312
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:19,045
就是坠机那天 对吗?
right after the crash, that day?

313
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:22,025
那就是"快"的意思 Ben
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

314
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:27,055
你在想为什么你还不能恢复
You're wondering why it hasn't happened for you.

315
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:31,007
你的伤只能慢慢恢复
You're not recovering as fast as you like.

316
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,097
Jack帮你手术到现在多久了?
How long's it been since Jack fixed you?

317
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,092
一个星期?
A week?

318
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,098
我仔细一想
Now that I think about it,

319
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,076
原来你是怎么得病的?
how did you get sick in the first place?

320
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:43,065
你害怕那会消失吗 John?
Are you afraid it'll go away, John?

321
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,081
这就是你想炸毁那潜艇的原因吧!
Is that why you want to destroy the submarine?

322
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,055
因为你知道如果你离开这座岛
'Cause you know if you leave the island,

323
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:49,081
你又得回到轮椅上了
you'll be back in the chair?

324
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,046
你有吃的东西吗?
You got anything to eat?

325
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:19,052
回家去吧 孩子 你知道你不该在这儿的
Go on home,kid.You know you're not supposed to be here.

326
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:22,042
我父亲要我来拿他的包
My father sent me to get his pack.

327
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:26,053
为什么?
Why?

328
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:29,070
我不知道Ryan 但是他叫我来拿的
I don't know,Ryan,but he told me to get it.

329
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,071
好吧
All right.

330
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:34,002
拿去吧
Here you go.

331
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:41,006
你是Alex 对吗?
You're Alex, aren't you?

332
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:45,087
你是怎么知道我名字的?
How do you know my name?

333
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,088
因为你和你母亲长的很像
Because you look like your mother.

334
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:53,011
我母亲已经死了
My mother is dead.

335
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:57,020
我相信他们是这么和你说的
I'm sure that's what they told you.

336
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,006
快走吧 Alex!
Get going, Alex!

337
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:10,039
你给我闭嘴
Keep your mouth shut.

338
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,093
你们的电是从哪里来的?
Where do you get electricity?

339
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:22,018
我们有两个巨大的"仓鼠"来转动那个发电盘
We have two giant hamsters running on a massive wheel

340
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,049
-我们地下有个秘密的兽穴  -这真有趣
-at our secret underground lair.  -Yeah, that's funny.

341
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:29,020
冰箱里还有一些剩菜 你自便吧
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.Help yourself.

342
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:42,062
很抱歉我喜欢吃禽类
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

343
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:51,057
我好久没品尝鸡的味道了
I never really appreciated chicken until right now.

344
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:55,013
我知道你要这么做 John
I know you think you need to do this, John,

345
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,093
但如果你炸了我的潜艇
but if you blow up my submarine,

346
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:59,039
我就要遇到很大的麻烦了
I'll have a big problem with my people.

347
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,088
你这是在奉劝我不要这么做吗?
Is that supposed to be an incentive not to blow it up?

348
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,015
我出生在这个岛上
I was born on this island.

349
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,010
没有几个人和我是一样的
Not many of my people can say that.

350
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,026
大多数人都是因招募而被带到这里来的
Most of them were recruited and brought here.

351
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,036
他们越爱这座岛
And as much as they love this place,

352
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,059
就越会不惜一切代价来保护这座岛
as much as they would do anything to defend it,

353
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,011
他们需要知道他们能离开这里
they need to know they can leave if they want to.

354
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:22,082
而那艘潜艇维系着他们的希望
The sub maintains that illusion.

355
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,092
那你是在欺骗他们
So you're lying to 'em.

356
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:26,038
不 他们是自愿留下的
No. They're here because they want to be here.

357
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,055
有些人只是还没有完全接受
Some of them are just not ready to make a full... commitment yet.

358
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,019
但你 John...
But you, John...

359
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,079
你已经做出了选择
You've already made that commitment,

360
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,019
而现在你有一个选择
and now you have a choice.

361
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,035
停下好好想想
Because if you stop and if you think,

362
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:42,081
我能给你看样东西
I can show you things...

363
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:46,033
那样你想了很久的东西
things I know you want to see very badly.

364
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,081
让我说的明白一点
Let me put it so you'll understand.

365
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,036
想象一下这里有个盒子
Picture a box.

366
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,003
你很了解盒子的 是吗 John?
You know something about boxes,don't you, John?

367
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,068
如果我告诉你在这座岛的某处
What if I told you that somewhere on this island

368
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:05,002
有一个巨大的盒子
there's a very large box,

369
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:08,092
无论你怎么想象 无论你希望那里面是什么
and whatever you imagined,whatever you wanted to be in it,

370
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,057
当你打开它时 它就会出现在你的眼前
when you opened at box,there it would be.

371
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,026
你怎么说 John?
What would you say about that, John?

372
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:25,074
我说那个盒子里最好是一艘新的潜艇
I'd say I hope that box is big enough to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

373
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:31,021
-你为什么这么愤怒John?  -因为你在撒谎
-Why are you so angry, John?  -Because you're cheating.

374
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,090
你和你的人
You and your people

375
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:35,097
能无限制的和外界联系
communicate with the outside world whenever you want to.

376
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,058
你们来去自如
You come and go as you please.

377
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,038
你们用电和水 还有枪
You use electricity and running water and guns.

378
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,029
你是一个伪君子
You're a hypocrite, a Pharisee.

379
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,034
你不配生活在这岛上
You don't deserve to be on this island.

380
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:49,094
如果你真的知道这个地方的奇妙之处
If you had any idea what this place really was,

381
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,017
你就不会把鸡放进你的冰箱了
you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator.

382
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,045
你才来了80天 John
You've been here 80 days, John.

383
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:57,013
我的一生都在这座岛上
I've been here my entire life.

384
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,050
是什么让你认为你比我更了解这座岛的?
So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?

385
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:04,074
因为现在坐在轮椅上的人是你
Because you're in the wheelchair,

386
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,009
而不是我
and I'm not.

387
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:26,077
遇到什么麻烦了吗?
Did you have any problems?

388
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:34,035
现在照我说的做
Okay, here's how this is gonna work...

389
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,019
她要带我去潜艇那里
she's gonna take me to the sub.

390
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,049
一到那里 我就放她走
Once we're there, I let her go.

391
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,059
John你可以让她走了
John, she's done enough.

392
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,070
让我带你去吧
Let me take you.

393
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,058
我不想让你拖累我
I don't want you to slow me down.

394
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,016
快 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

395
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,008
John 在你走之前 你应该知道...
John, before you go, you should know...

396
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:50,063
Jack和我做了笔交易
Jack and I made a deal.

397
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,009
不到一小时内他就会离开这里的
In less than an hour he's leaving this island

398
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,083
而那艘潜艇只是单程的
on that submarine,and it's a 1-way ticket.

399
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,090
异常现象破坏了我们的通讯系统
The anomaly wiped out our communications.

400
00:29:57,091 --> 00:30:01,003
我们和外界失去了联系...
We have no way of contacting the outside world...

401
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:04,016
那意味着一旦潜艇出发
Which means when that sub leaves,

402
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,049
它就永远回不来了
it can never come back.

403
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,007
你炸毁它也好
So whether you destroy the submarine

404
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:11,047
让它走也好 都是一个结果
or whether you let it go,the end result is the same

405
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:13,098
没人会找到这座岛的
no one will find this island.

406
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:18,019
我们走
Let's go.

407
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:21,080
快点
Come on.

408
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,090
你知道他是在操纵你对吗?
You know he's manipulating you, right?

409
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,035
怎么说?
How's that?

410
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,070
我父亲就是这样的人
That's what my father does.He manipulates people.

411
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:30,056
他能操纵别人
He manipulates people.

412
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:33,051
他让你感觉那是你的主意 其实那是他的
He makes you think it's your idea,but it's his.

413
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:36,024
那我要牢记在心了
I'll have to keep that in mind.

414
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:46,097
潜艇就在那儿...
Submarine's down there...

415
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:49,029
在码头的尽头
At the end of the dock.

416
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:53,094
我很抱歉把你圈进来
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

417
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:08,082
我知道你不欠我什么
Look, I know you don't owe me anything,

418
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:12,010
但我需要你最后帮我一次
but I need to ask you for one last favor.

419
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,039
你还想怎么样?
You don't knock?

420
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,098
你要放了我的朋友
I need you to let my friends go

421
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,099
在我走之后
after I'm gone.

422
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,010
如果我说不 那会阻止你走吗?
And if I said no,would that stop you from leaving?

423
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,016
当然会的
Of course it would.

424
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:39,041
你的朋友只是来救你的
Your friends are only here to rescue you.

425
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:43,022
而你好像是在挽救你自己 那么...
But you seem to be doing a good job of rescuing yourself, so...

426
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:49,002
我也没有理由把他们留在这儿了
I suppose there's no reason to keep them here.

427
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,059
你能保证吗?
Do I have your word on that?

428
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,059
我保证
You have my word.

429
00:32:57,013 --> 00:33:01,037
你走之后我一定会放了他们的
I'll let them go just as soon as you've left the island.

430
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,025
我想就这样了
Well, I guess this is it.

431
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:21,030
谢谢你遵守你的诺言 Ben
Thank you, Ben,for keeping your promise.

432
00:33:58,014 --> 00:33:59,083
站在那里别动!
Hold it right there!

433
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,018
把手举起来!
Get your hands up!

434
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,041
趴下!我说趴下!
Get down! I said get down!

435
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:17,056
你在这里干什么 John?
What are you doing here, John?

436
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,057
我很抱歉 Jack
I'm sorry, Jack.

437
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:24,008
为什么?
Sorry for what?

438
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,090
你干了什么?
What did you do?

439
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:55,093
告诉我不是你干的
Tell me you didn't do it.

440
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,002
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

441
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:59,048
告诉我你没有杀那个孩子
Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!

442
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:00,048
什么?
What?

443
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,095
你认为我和Peter的死有关吗?
You think I had something to do with Peter's death?

444
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:04,066
我告诉你结束这一切
I tell you to end things with his mother,

445
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,023
接下来 他就死了!
and the next thing you know, he's dead!

446
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,081
John请你冷静一点
John, now calm down, please.

447
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:10,020
想想你自己说的 我为什么要杀Peter呢?
Think about what you're saying.Why would I kill Peter?

448
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,026
他盯上你了!
He was on to you!

449
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:15,005
我干这行很久了 我不会害怕一个毛头小子的
I've been doing this for a long time.I'm not sweating some rich kid.

450
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,026
那为什么你还在这里?
Then why are you still here?

451
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,003
-你的意思是?  -我让你离开这里
-What do you mean?  -I tell you to leave.

452
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:19,073
你告诉我你会离开的
You tell me you're gonna leave town.

453
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:22,002
为什么你还在这里?!
Why are you still here?

454
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:25,064
听着John 老实对你说
Now listen, John,I'll be honest with you.

455
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:27,053
我没有兑现诺言
I didn't end it.

456
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,028
我想干下去
I was looking for an angle.

457
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:32,039
我想在我退休前捞一笔
I wanted to make some money before I skipped out.

458
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,059
但后来发生了这事
But then all this happened.

459
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,053
Peter死了 一切都落空了
Peter died, and everything just went straight into the tank.

460
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:41,052
她受到很大的打击
She's devastated.

461
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,011
她取消了婚礼
She's called off the wedding.

462
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,065
已经无利可图了 John
There's no profit in it, John.

463
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:49,066
我是一个骗子 但不是杀人犯
I'm a con man, not a murder.

464
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:54,022
她取消了婚礼?
She called off the wedding?

465
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:57,057
她说她做不到
She said she couldn't deal with it.

466
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,097
她需要独自面对
She needs to be alone.

467
00:35:58,098 --> 00:36:01,065
如果我现在打电话给她
So if I were to call her right now,

468
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,022
这就是她要告诉我的?
that's what she would tell me?

469
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:08,079
电话就在那边 John
Phone's right over there, John.

470
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:16,068
她的号码是...
What's her numb...

471
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:28,056
Locke我们知道你不想听到这个消息 但是...
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't what you want to hear, but...

472
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,062
你父亲逃走了
Your father's gone.

473
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,054
他去了墨西哥 在你们那次相遇后...
We know he fled to Mexico shortly after your...

474
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:36,098
然后就消失了
encounter, then he disappeared.

475
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:41,013
我很抱歉 他也许在这个世界的任何地方
I'm sorry, but he could be anywhere in the world right now.

476
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:44,059
好了 探长们 今天就到此为止
All right, detectives,that's enough.

477
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,032
Locke先生 今天有活干了
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

478
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:51,093
如果有什么消息我们会通知你的
We'll let you know if anything develops.

479
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:57,070
今天我们有好多事要做
We have got ourselves quite a day ahead of us, my friend.

480
00:36:57,071 --> 00:37:00,016
你终于可以起床了
It's finally time to get you up out of that bed.

481
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,081
不 我不想
No. I don't want to.

482
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:04,016
这可没有选择
I don't remember asking.

483
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:10,063
现在
Now...

484
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:12,082
大多数人一开始都不想坐这玩意儿
Most people struggle with this at first,

485
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,083
但别担心
but don't worry.

486
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:17,006
你会习惯的
You'll get used to it.

487
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,079
不 求你了 我做不到
No, please. I can't do this.

488
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:24,004
你从八楼摔下来 并幸存了下来
You fell eight stories and survived.

489
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,011
我不想听到 有什么你做不到的
I don't want to hear about what you can't do.

490
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:27,025
好了
Now let's go.

491
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,065
会没事的
It's gonna be all right.

492
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,075
一切都会好的 John
It's gonna be fine, John.

493
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:32,032
-来吧  -不 我不能...
-Come on.  -No, I can't...

494
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:39,088
很好
You're fine...

495
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:43,008
行了
There we go.

496
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,034
行了 伙计
There you go, buddy.

497
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:48,016
看见了?
See?

498
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:50,060
也没那么糟 不是吗?
Wasn't that bad, was it?

499
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,086
我一会儿就回来 伙计
Be right back, buddy.

500
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:34,017
John你真的说到做到了
Well, John,you've really gone and done it now.

501
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:37,065
你不必装的很失望
You don't have to pretend to be disappointed anymore.

502
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:40,088
我们都知道你想让这一切发生
We both know you wanted it to happen.

503
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,071
这就是为什么你留下了Sayid包里的C-4
That's why you left the c4 in Sayid's bag

504
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:47,005
因为你想让这一切发生
Because you wanted me to make it happen.

505
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:50,018
拜托你解开他 Richard
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

506
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,031
你会做傻事吗?
You gonna do anything stupid?

507
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:00,066
不 先生
No, sir.

508
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:09,024
你还记得吗?John 当你叫我骗子的时候...
Do you remember earlier, John,when you called me a cheater...

509
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:13,007
当你说我不配待在这岛上的时候...
When you said I didn't deserve to live on this island? Well, get this--

510
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:16,000
当我和Jack握手的时候
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

511
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,054
我想方设法不让他离开这座岛
and thinking I'd give almost anything to come up with a way to stop him from leaving,

512
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,073
因为如果他离开的话
because to let him go

513
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:24,081
那会是一个软弱的信号 一个失败的信号
would be a sign a weakness,of failure, of defeat.

514
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:25,097
我的人都看在眼里
My people would see that.

515
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:27,091
他们会知道的
They would know it,

516
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:30,012
然后John 所有的错误都会归咎于我
and that, John, would be the end of me.

517
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:32,013
但如果我杀了他...
But to kill him...

518
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,054
那才是欺骗
That would be cheating,

519
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:37,061
因为我的人知道 我许下诺言
because my people also heard me make a promise,

520
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:40,001
如果我打破诺言...
and to break my word...

521
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,043
他们还是会归咎于我的
that would be the end of me, too.

522
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:50,076
而这时你出现了 John...
And then you came striding out of the jungle, John...

523
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:55,055
并实现了我的梦想
to you make my dream come true.

524
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:02,004
你不是又想和我说那个神奇的盒子了吧?
You're not gonna start talking about the magic box again, are you?

525
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:07,091
不John 我要带你去看那里面到底有什么
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

526
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:21,075
当我那时问你 你是否很痛苦
When I asked you earlier if it hurt

527
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:25,002
当你忍受伤痛时 你一定误解我的意思了
when you suffered your injury,I think you misunderstood me.

528
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:28,026
很明显 当一个人被扔下高楼
It seems fairly obvious that when a person's back smashes

529
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:30,065
背部撞击地面时
into a hard surface after being thrown from a building,

530
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,083
会有很强烈的剧痛
that's gonna sting a little.

531
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:36,046
但我问的不是肉体上的伤痛
But I really wasn't asking about the physical pain.

532
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:38,074
你想知道那是否伤了我的感情?
What, do you want to know if it hurt my feelings?

533
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:41,034
不John 我想知道当你亲身父亲
No, John.I wanted to know what it felt like

534
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:44,052
想要杀你时你的感受
when your own father tried to kill you.

535
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:51,002
他就是你要炸毁潜艇的原因 是吗?
He's the reason you destroyed the submarine, isn't he?

536
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:53,021
你害怕了
You're afraid.

537
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:56,052
你怕他了 而这是唯一一个他找不到你的地方
You're afraid of him, and this is the one place he can never find you.

538
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,062
这是唯一他来不了的地方
This is the one place he can never get to.

539
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:01,002
你想要我做什么?
What do you want from me?

540
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:06,026
我不知道这是怎么发生的...
I don't know how it happened...

541
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:11,041
但你能和这座岛交流 John
But you seem to have some communion with this island, John,

542
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:14,054
而这让你变的特别重要
and that makes you very, very important.

543
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:17,023
你不知道自己在说什么
You have no idea what you're talking about, of course,

544
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,028
但经过一段时间你会更好的去理解事物的
but in time you'll have a better understanding of things.

545
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:24,026
那么我想要什么呢?
So what do I want?

546
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:27,041
我想帮助你 John
I want to help you, John.

547
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,004
为什么?
Why?

548
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:34,097
因为我在轮椅上 而你不是
Because I'm in a wheelchair,and you're not.

549
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:42,086
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready to see?

550
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:22,050
