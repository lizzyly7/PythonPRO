我刚在 Ben 的肾脏旁边切了个小口

完成他的手术

00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,099
我为什么要这样做?
And why would I want to do that?

因为我能帮你的朋友逃跑
Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.

- 请你给我一个理由  - 我们不能把 Jack 留在那里
- You give me one good reason to turn...  - Because we can't leave Jack behind.

你想想  如果我们回去

26
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:21,067
被那个白痴猎人Ben抓到 他会怎么对待我们?

你刚帮我救了他的命

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,043
你要杀我的话就说的直接点
If you're gonna kill me,pls,at least show me the respect of not calling it "moving."

39
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,060
我们为什么要杀你?
Now why would we kill you?

我就是这么想的

她是司法长官

77
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,000
- 你们有司法长官?   - 不完全是 Jack

78
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,021
你们为什么要把 Juliet 转到我的房间?
Why are you moving Juliet into my room?

00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:57,006
因为她有麻烦了 Jack
'Cause she's in trouble.

80
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:04,018
你别干傻事 老实待着
Now don't try anything stupid. You stay put in this cage, okay?

你们不是有监视器吗?

对了 Ben告诉我 你进过监控室

问你个问题
Let me ask you something.

你冒着生命危险

你说在干吗  我们要上岸啊!
What's it look like? I'm heading into shore.

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,053
如果我们沿着海岸继续划 可以划到我们的营地

我们可以告诉 Locke 和 Sayid 发生了什么
Sooner or later we'll get to camp and tell Locke and Sayid what happened.

92
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,019

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,004
你有地图吗 麦哲伦小妞?
You got a map you ain't showing me, Magellan?

94
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,020
我们没有水没有食物
We got no food, no water,

95
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:03,020
在夜里我不能划这艘船
and I can't steer in the dark.

96
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,083
- 那么让我来  - 不行
- Then I'll steer.  - No.

97

我们上岸然后扎营

你们不该吵架 因为你们幸运的活了下来

105
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:54,050
你们住在那座岛上吗?
That island we were on... Is that where your people live?

106
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:58,080
- 只是用来工作  - 什么工作?
- Just where we work.  - Work on what?

107
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,017
一些工程
Projects.

108
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:03,072
就像 "把孩子从木伐上偷走" 的工程?
Oh, sure, like the "steal the kid off the raft" project?

109
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,018
干的真是出色
That was a humdinger.

110
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,010
你们不是住在那座岛上的?
So you don't actually live on that island?

111
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,039
你住在这里...
Do you live here...

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,039
这座岛上吗?
on this island?

113

114
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:20,078
那你们为什么要抓那些人...
And what did you do with the people that you took...

115
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,099
和孩子们?
the kids?

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,061
我们要给他们更好的生活
We give them a better life.

117
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,087
相对什么?
Better than what?

118

相对你们的生活
Better than yours.

119

今晚不会有月亮了

晚上我和 Alex 通常躺在 我家的后院

是的
Yes.

137

你不必为他们... 或他这么做
I'm not asking you for them... or him.

141
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:59,093
就算是为了我

142
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:04,092
你想让我再帮他一次?
You... want me to help him again?

143
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,051
是的
Yes.

144

你确定吗 Juliet?
Are you sure about that, Juliet?

145

是的 我很确定
Yes... I'm sure.

146
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:15,027
这是因为他能让你回家吗?
And this is because he said that he would let you go home?

147
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:16,099
不是的
No.

148
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,028

因为我遇到麻烦了

150
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,095
- 麻烦? 为了...  - 我杀了个人
- Trouble? For...  - I just killed someone.

151
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:30,032
所以他们把我关起来了
That's why they put me in your room.

152
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,038
你杀了谁?
Who?

153
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:36,096
这很复杂
It's complicated.

154
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:41,083
让我直接和你说吧
Well, then, let me simplify it for you.

155
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,051
我不会帮他的...
I'm not gonna help him...

156
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:49,006

今日特别泰国菜 你尝尝
Special Thai dish for you. You try.

我哥哥喜欢你
My brother likes you.

160

我是一个受欢迎的人
Well, I'm a very likeable guy.

161
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:42,065
Jack...

162
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,094
问你个问题
tell me something.

163
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,052
说吧
Shoot.

164
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:50,066
为什么你不懂怎么放风筝?
Why is it you don't know how to fly a kite?

165
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:54,074
- 我从没学过  - 那真可惜
- Just never learned, I guess.  - That's very sad.

166
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:57,066
我爸工作很忙
Well, my dad worked a lot.

167
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,016
而且他也不是那种会喜欢放风筝的人
He wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway.

168
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,083
- 我的意思是 我们  - Jack
- I mean, we never really...  -Jack

169
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:07,014
- 怎么了?  - 我对你父亲不感兴趣
- Yeah?  - I have no interest in your father.

170
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,084
好吧 我也厌倦了总是说起他
Well, that's a relief,because I'm pretty tired of talking about him.

171
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,085
有些事可以放在心里
Some things are personal.

172
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:25,024
你来 Phuket 是 "找回自我"?
So you're in Phuket to... "find yourself"?

173
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,078
- 为什么这么说?  - 你是个美国人
- Why would you say that?  - You're an American.

174
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,038
我有...
I have...

175
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,030
一个天赋
a gift.

176
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,098
那一定很值得期待
Must be one hell of a gift.

177
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,041
我在读你纹身上的字
I was just reading your tattoos.

178
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,017
"五" 和周围的星星都很漂亮
The "five" and the stars are very cute,

179
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:31,089
但那上面的中文字...
But the Chinese I find...

180
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,021
有点讽刺
a bit ironic.

181
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:39,019
- 什么讽刺?  - 它所表达的
- You find what ironic?  - What it says.

182
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,052
你知道它表示什么?
You do know what it says?

183
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,060
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know what it says.

184
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,027
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

185
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:51,098
中文是一种很复杂的语言
Chinese is a very complicated language.

186
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,048
我们往往会不能完全理解它的意思
It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation.

187
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:01,000
- 我知道它表示什么  - 那好吧
- I know what it says.  - All right, then.

188
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,054
Jack...

189
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,017
我的名字叫 Isabel
My name is Isabel.

190
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,050
如果你跟我来
If you'll come with me,

191
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:17,035
我要问你几个问题
I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions.

192
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:33,091
你为什么不去看看你父亲 他会很高兴的
Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.

193
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,083
请坐 Jack
Please, have a seat, Jack.

194
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:50,091
我们今天聚在一起
As you may have gathered,

195
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,079
我们不住在这座小岛上
we don't live on this little island.

196
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,050
我们也不喜欢来这里
In fact, most of us don't really even like coming here.

197
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:59,013
我在调查一起暴力事件
There's been an incident that I'm investigating,

198
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,018
我要问你几个问题
and I need to ask you some questions,

199
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,001
希望你能解决这里的...
so I was hoping you may help me clear up

200
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,056
不安定因素
a few of the... inconsistencies.

201
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:10,089
如果我说错的话告诉我 Tom
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

202
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,081
你说在手术过程中
but you said, in the midst of a surgical procedure,

203
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:20,083
Jack 说 Juliet 让他杀死 Ben
Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

204
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,061
对
Yeah. That's right.

205
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,087
这是真的吗 Jack?
Is that true, Jack?

206
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:30,005
Juliet 有没有叫你杀了 Ben?
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

207
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,030
问题很简单 Juliet 有没有叫你杀了 Ben?
The question's simple. Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

208
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,088
没有
No

209
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,022
没有 我撒了谎
No, I was lying.

210
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,064
我会尽全力救我的伙伴
I would've done anything to get my friends out,

211
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,077
所以我制造混乱
and turning you people against each other

212
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,015
让你们互相猜疑
was my best chance of creating chaos.

213
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,013
你为什么替她撒谎 Jack?
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

214
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:24,014
我想回我的牢房
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

215
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,069
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

你认为呢?
Who do you think?

217

几点了?
What time is it?

218

很晚了
It's late.

219
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,067
好咸啊
Salty.

220
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:05,009
我去大海游泳了
I went for a swim in the ocean.

221

洗刷一天的疲劳?
Washing the day off of you, huh?

222
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,097
你想问我什么 Jack?
Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack?

223
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:15,019
什么都没有
No, not at all.

224
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,098
这样也好...
I mean...it might be nice...

225
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:22,065
已经一个月了
after a month of you coming and going whenever you want,

226
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,079
我还对你一无所知
to find out something about you.

这里发生的事你永远不会了解

- 被劫持了  - 他们不是...

经历了这一切...
All this time...

289
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,035
他对你的人的所作所为...
After all he did to you and your people...

290
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,027
你应该恨他才对
you should hate him,

291
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,077
但你还是救了他的命
But you still fixed him up,

292

如果不是为了你 她不会这么做的

00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:24,007
那是第三个问题了
That was three questions.

307
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:27,041
到你了 Jack
Your turn, Jack.

308

我救你父亲 因为我答应过他
I saved your father because I said I would.

00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,068
Isabel 会听他的吗?
Will that woman Isabel do what he says?

313
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:49,093
是的
Yeah.

314
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,065
把我放出来
Get me out of this cage.

315
00:25:56,086 --> 00:26:01,011
我不会这么做的
I wouldn't do that.

316
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:07,075
骑兵终于来了
The cavalry has arrived at last.

317
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:22,068
如果你们有个出色外科医生就好了
I'd be much more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon.

318
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:29,022
我们曾经有的 Jack
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

319
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:32,085
他叫 Ethan

320
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:36,010
已经大面积感染了 Ben
You have a very serious infection, Ben.

321
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,064
被感染的组织需要从新切开
That infected tissue needs to be re-incised, debrided,

322
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:44,052
你需要随时监控
and you need to be very closely monitored from here on out.

323
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:49,069
不然也许会造成神经受损 或者会有其它炎症
There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications.

324
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,087
你可能永远不能走路了
You might not walk again.

325
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:57,049
这话告诉我你另有所图
Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.

326
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,080
谁让你和我困在一起了
Well, then, it's too bad you're stuck with me.

327
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:03,063
是吗?
Am I?

328
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,034
你需要一名医生 Ben
You need a doctor, Ben.

329
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,009
能和你待在一起
someone to stay with you

330

让你快点恢复
bring you back to good health.

331
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:17,052
又来了
And here we go again.

332
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:20,093
我已经答应你 让你离开这座岛了 Jack
I've already given you a ticket off this island.

333
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:23,035
这次你又要我做什么?
What's it gonna cost me this time?

334
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:27,007
现在你的人正在讨论
Right now your people are in a room

335
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:30,099
是否要处决 Juliet
deciding whether or not to execute Juliet.

336
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,079
你可以阻止他们
You're gonna stop it.

337
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:40,080
Juliet 不在乎你的 Jack
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

338
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:44,029
不管她做了什么
Doesn't matter what she's done,

339
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,014
不论你怎么想...
No matter what you think...

340
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:52,018
她还是我们的人
she's one of us.

341
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:58,040
成交吗?
Do we have a deal or not?

342
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:07,020
Isabel 有对讲机吗?
Does Isabel have a walkie?

343
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:10,083
他们已经在开会了
They're already in the meeting.

344
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,088
那就拿纸过来写吧
Then get me something to write on.

345
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,091
你跟踪我
You following me.

346

这些都是什么?
What is all this?

347
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:47,041
这是我工作的地方
This is where I work,

348
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:50,034
你不该来这儿
and you shouldn't be here.

349
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:55,018
这是...
This is a...

350
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,027
纹身店 这就是你的秘密?
a tattoo parlor. This was your big secret?

351
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:02,080
信封... 你的天赋?
The envelopes... your gift?

352
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:06,040
我不是纹身艺术家
I am not a tattoo artist.

353
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:15,040
我能看出你是怎样一个人
I'm able to see who people are.

354
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,065
我的工作不是装饰...
My work is not decoration...

355
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,046
而是注释...
it is definition...

356
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,070
而这...
and this...

357
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,021
才是我的天赋
this is my gift.

358
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,055
那么...
So...

359
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:32,008
你能看穿人们
you see who people are.

360
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,060
是的... 然后帮他们做记号
Yes... and I mark them.

361
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:41,094
那告诉我我是怎么样一个人
So tell me who I am.

362
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:46,001
- 不行  - 为什么?
- No.  - Why not?

363
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:48,002
你是个外来者
You are an outsider.

364
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,073
那你就可以和我上床...
So you can sleep with me...

365
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:52,061
我不可以这么做
I'm not allowed.

366
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:56,065
你知道我是怎样一个人 是吗 Achara?
Do you see who I am, Achara?

367
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:58,091
是的
Yes.

368
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:01,020
那告诉我
Who am I?

369
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:03,070
你是一个领袖
You are a leader,

370
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,004
一个伟大的人
a great man.

371
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:09,005
但这...
But this...

372
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,068
会让你孤独...
this makes you lonely...

373
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:16,072
恐惧...
and frightened..

374
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:19,072
暴怒
and angry.

375
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,086
好
Good.

376
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:33,094
给我作标记吧

377
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:36,023
干吧!
Put it on me.

378
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,073
不 这...
No. This...

379
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:42,029
是在违背我们的人
this is against my people.

380
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:54,097
这会有报应的 Jack
There will be consequences, Jack.

381
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:58,014
当然会有
There always are.

382
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,057
等等 你不该在这里的
Wait. No, you shouldn't be here.

383
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:26,020
退后
Just stand back.

384
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,067
不要说话
Don't say anything.

385
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,076
Alex 你...
Alex, you...

386
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,072
Jack?

387
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:44,088
你把他带来干什么?!
What the hell did you bring him here for?!

388
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,039
放开他 Tom
Let him go, Tom.

389
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:51,036
怎么了 Alex?
What's going on, Alex?

390
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,040
这是 Ben 写的
This is from Ben.

391
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:07,007
Ben 减轻了 Juliet 的罪
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

392
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,032
免除死刑
Execution is off the table.

393
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:13,030
他说规章不能改变
He says the rules don't apply.

394
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:18,047
但是 她必须被烙上印记
He has, however, ordered her to be marked.

395
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,009
你去哪儿?
Hey, where you going?

00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,035
我认识你

397

我是 Achara 的朋友 从...
I'm Achara's friend from...

398
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:20,019
我来过你的餐馆
Chet's,from the restaurant.

399
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:26,049
放开我 兄弟
Let go of me, man.

400
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,018
滚出我们的海滩!
You will get off our beach!

401
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,089
然后滚出这个国家!
You leave this country!

402
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,077
你明白吗?!
Do you understand me?

403
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:01,021
听说你只喜欢烤的
I heard you only liked them grilled.

404
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:07,047
我也想念这个牙签了
I missed the toothpicks, too.

405
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:17,064
- 让我看看  - Jack...
- Let me see.  - Jack...

406
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:21,032
他们给你做记号 让我看看
They marked you. Let me see it.

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
折一片芦荟给我...
Break a branch off that aloe plant over there...

408
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,079
- 没关系的 Jack   - 求你了
- It's ok, Jack.  - Please.

409
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,022
求你了
Please do it.

410
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,019
好了 转过身
All right, turn around.

411
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:30,054
为什么帮我?
Why did you help me?

412
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:33,042
他告诉你会让你回家
He told you he was gonna let you go home.

413
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:36,022
他也许诺我同样的事
He told me the same thing.

414
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,030
我们要保证他说到做到
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word.

415
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,089
我们怎么做?
And how are we going to do that?

416
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,011
一起面对
Together.

417
00:37:55,091 --> 00:38:01,066
过几分钟他们都会来找你
They'll be coming for you in a few minutes... All of them.

418
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,058
你的朋友知道我们在哪儿
Your friends know where we are,

419
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,062
所以我们要回去我们住的地方
so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live.

420
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:10,026
去哪儿?
Go where?

421
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:13,068
Ben 叫它"家园"
Well, Ben calls it "home."

422
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,052
- Karl 在哪里?   - 我让他走了
- Where's Karl?  -I let him go.

423
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,051
- 什么?   - 我让他走了
- You what?  - I let him go.

424
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,060
他能带我们去他们住的地方
He could have led us back to where they live.

425
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,056
你以为我放了他 是因为我很敏感吗?
What, you think I cut him loose 'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

426
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,056
那孩子是靶子
The kid's a target.

427
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:36,007
Ben 不会放弃找到他 直到...
Ben ain't never gonna stop looking for him, so as long...

428
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:40,082
Ben 只想让他远离他女儿
All Ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible.

429
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,054
我们回营地吧
Let's get back to camp.

430
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,008
你来不来啊?
Are you coming or not?

431
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:54,034
我是和你一起走 还是跟在你后面比较好?
Should I walk beside you or ten paces behind you?

432
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,092
难道你就不觉得很自私么?
You're so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore.

433
00:38:57,093 --> 00:39:00,047
别因为你自己有罪恶感 就把这些盖到我头上
Don't take it out on me 'cause you feel guilty.

434
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:02,018
- 我没感到罪恶  - 才怪!
- I don't feel guilty.  - The hell you don't!

435
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,068
我们必须留下Jack  我没有选择...
We had to leave Jack behind. I didn't have a choice...

436
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,015
我不是说这个
I'm not talking about leaving Jack behind.

437
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:16,087
我是说你我的事
I'm talking about you and me.

438
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:26,095
你这么做是因为 你知道我死定了...
I know you did it 'cause you thought I was a dead man...

439
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:31,042
不要因为医生还留在那里  而埋怨自己
so don't beat yourself up 'cause the doc's left behind.

440
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,017
我没有埋怨自己
I'm not beating myself up.

441
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:38,064
当然
'Course you're not.

442
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:48,002
现在我们可以走了吗?
So now that we got that out of the way, let's go.

443
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:18,000
"他与我们共同前进，但却不是我们的一员"
"He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us."

444
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:22,035
这就是你纹身的意义
Your tattoos...That's what they say.

445
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,060
这是他们说的
That's what they say.

446
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,048
但不是这个意思
It's not what they mean.
