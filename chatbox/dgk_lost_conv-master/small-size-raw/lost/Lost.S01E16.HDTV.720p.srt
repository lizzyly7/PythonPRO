4
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,082

一个护士告诉我你的手在颤抖

00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:36,026
在手术正常进行后我才进入手术室

我到这里的时候  这已经很清楚了

我父亲切断了病人的肝动脉

14
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,064

你不知道我是谁但是我知道你做了什么

你的名字不是Sawyer   对吧?

这是他的名字  他是一个骗子

00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,014
躲到床下去

滚开
Go away!

48
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,067
你究竟是怎么了?
What the hell is wrong with you?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,009
我要叫警察了  滚开
I'm calling the police! Get out of here!

50
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,043
你干什么? 你拿枪究竟想干什么? 出去...
What are you doing? What the hell are you doing with a gun? Get out --

51
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,000
它会回来的
It'll come back around.

52
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:34,052
油布被野猪弄走了?
Boar took your tarp?

53
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,063
当时很黑  但是  是的 我很肯定是一只野猪
It was dark,but,yeah,pretty sure it was a boar.

54
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,057
我认为这只野猪已经离开这儿了
I thought the boar had vacated this area.

55
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,031
强人  我认为有一些坏消息
genius,I think we got some bad info.

56
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,020
它在你帐篷里干什么?
What was he doing inside your tent?

57
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,076
它盯着我
It was staring at me.

58
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,059
然后它向我冲了过来  我打了它 然后它跑进了丛林
Then it came at me,so I hit it,and it ran off into the jungle.

59
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,053
带着你的油布
With your tarp.

60
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,037
或许他想去露营
Perhaps he wanted to go camping.

61
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,044
你很开心么?
You enjoying yourself?

62
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,084
是的
Yes.

63
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,069
笑出声来吧  穆罕默德
laugh it up,Muhammed.

64
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:09,063
但是我回来后发现我的东西没了
But I come back and find my stuff's gone

65
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,063
我跟着你
I'm coming after you.

66
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,002
Sayid?

67
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,092
你听到了什么?
What did you hear?

68
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,044
在你偶然遇到那个法国女人之后
After you ran into the French woman

69
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,046
你说你在丛林里听到了些什么
you said you heard something in the jungle.

70
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:38,092
我受伤了，精疲力竭  估计我脑子一下子糊涂了
I was injured and I was exhausted. My mind was playing tricks.

71
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,042
你听到什么了?
What did you hear?

72
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:45,020
我想我听到了有人在说悄悄话
I thought I heard whispering.

73
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,071
说了什么?
What was it saying?

74
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,050
怎么了?
What was it saying?

75
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,017
你听到什么了?
Did you hear something?

76
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:01,042
算了  我什么都没听见
Forget it. I didn't hear anything.

77
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,018
你怕什么啊?
What are you so afraid of?

78
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,073
在发抖的是你，亲爱的
You're the one trembling,sweetness.

79
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:32,011
好了 虽然这真的很愚蠢
Okay,this is really awkward.

80
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,048
但是如果我现在不开口的话
But if I don't say something now

81
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:38,080
事情就会变得更让人为难了
things are liable to get downright embarrassing.

82
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,087
Hibbs

83
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,031
你好 Sawyer
Hello,Sawyer.

84
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,060
夫人 我想道歉
Ma'am,I must apologize.

85
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,031
我以为我的好朋友Sawyer 会一个人在这儿
I figured my good friend Sawyer here would be alone.

86
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,009
我只要一下就好
I just need a few minutes.

87
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,062
听着  亲爱的...
Listen,baby...

88

89
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,091
你去下面的酒吧喝点什么吧
You go down to the bar. You get a drink.

90
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,036
不  我不想把你留在这儿
No,I don't want to leave you here.

91
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,015
我一摆脱他后马上...
As soon as I get rid of him,

92
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,084
去找你  然后向你解释一切
then I'll come get you and I'll explain everything.

93
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,053
-但是...  -听着
-But...  -Listen.

94
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:06,032
相信我吧  我会找到你的
Just trust me on this. I will find you.

95
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:09,010
我保证  相信我
I promise. Promise.

96
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:12,053
你说说  Sawbucks...
I got to hand it to you,Sawbucks...

97
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:15,036
你是怎么骗到这么漂亮的女人的
how you find women that beautiful to work your grift.

98
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,035
如果我现在没错的话
Now,if I'm not mistaken

99
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:22,071
我记得很清楚 我说过我再次见到你我会杀了你
I'm fairly certain I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,096
所以我来了
That's why I'm here.

101
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,043
处理好一切
To make things right.

102
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:28,068
况且  我们都知道你不是杀人的人
Besides,we both know you ain't the killing type.

103
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,032
这个
Here.

104
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:43,064
我想我们在Tampa那件事上扯平了
Figure that makes us even for the Tampa job.

105
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:47,015
我们怎么可能在Tampa那件事上扯平呢
What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job?

106
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:51,049
那么关于那个毁了你一生的男人 他的下落呢?
How about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life?

107
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:55,016
我想来点喝的  你呢?
I'm gonna make myself a drink. You want one?

108
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,022
你记得那老家伙Parks么?
You remember old man Parks,right?

109
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:01,008
在亚特兰大那个马车上 帮我们支起顶棚的那个家伙?
Ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta?

110
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,031
是的  他怎样了?
Yeah,what about him?

111
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,095
他在悉尼的一家出线业务室拍电报
He's been working the wire at an off-track parlor down in Sydney.

112
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,083
上周
So last week,

113
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,019
他的一位常客鲁莽了些
one of his regulars gets a little too sauced,

114
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:13,010
把他的骗子生涯 给揭了个底儿朝天
starts running his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter.

115
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:16,042
那家伙  Frank Duckett
That guy. Frank Duckett.

116
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:19,011
真是一个不幸的人  沉迷于赌博和酒精
Real hard-luck case --gambling addict,alcoholic.

117
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,062
开一辆小卡车
Runs a shrimp truck.

118
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,011
想起来  Duckett这家伙还真是会骗
Back in the day,this guy Duckett was quite the hustler.

119
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,002
他善于使感情骗术
He ran the romance angle.

120
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,059
把别人老婆骗上钩  再拿走她老公所有的钱
Hook the wife,take the husband for all the money.

121
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,057
我听说他还真在行
Was pretty good at it,too,from what I hear.

122
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:36,018
直到其中一个人被他骗得伤心欲绝
Until sadly one of his marks in despair

123
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:39,005
带着枪  杀了他的妻子 然后饮弹自尽
took a gun,shot up his wife,and blew his own head off.

124
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,060
他们的小儿子目睹了所有的一切
All in front of their little boy.

125
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:45,051
我雇Tony偷走了他的夹克
I paid Tony to pull his jacket.

126
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,060
看来Frank Duckett曾经叫Frank Sawyer
Turns out Frank Duckett used to be named Frank Sawyer,

127
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,049
一个我认为很适合你的名字
a name I believe you appropriated for yourself.

128
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,024
这就是他?
This is him?

129
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,008
是的
That's him.

130
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,009
多谢债主
Thanks for the loaner.

131
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,014
没关系
Always a pleasure.

132
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,058
那么有人好奇它们从哪儿来么?
So is anyone curious where they came from?

133
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:24,049
他们都知道有位长官在飞机上
The others knew there was a marshal on the plane.

134
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:26,054
我猜他们认为他在单独做事
I guess they just assumed he was traveling alone,

135
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:29,029
保护他们不受恐怖分子侵害
protecting them from terrorists.

136
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,051
对我来说是个不错的理论
Sounds like a good theory to me.

137
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:40,019
你拿回了所有的枪么?
Did you get all the guns back?

138
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,047
除了一枝
All except one.

139
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,013
我让你猜三下怎么样?
How about I give you three guesses?

140
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,032
Sawyer

141
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:48,000
我能拿回的
I can get it back.

142
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,058
真的
Really.

143
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,096
你怎么拿?
How are you gonna do that?

144
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,009
说他的语言
Speak his language.

145
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,084
你已经这样做过了  Kate
You've done this before,Kate

146
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,097
如果我没记错
and if I remember it right

147
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,001
你了解他
you made out with him

148
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,034
你说你能拿到的东西他连有都没有
and he never even had what you said you could get.

149
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:05,035
我唯一了解的是他不吃硬的
Well,I only made out with him because torturing him didn't work.

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,095
枪让他留着吧  不值得这么做
Let him keep the gun. It's not worth it.

151
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:13,025
你担心如果我说了他会向我开枪?
You worried he's gonna shoot me if I ask?

152
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,014
我只是不想你欠他什么
I just don't want you to owe him anything.

153
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,014
感觉怎么样?
How you feeling?

154
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,004
感觉快生了
Very pregnant.

155
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,030
我昨晚做了几个梦
I had some dreams last night.

156
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,060
其实  很像是回忆
Actually,more like memories.

157
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,093
你也在里面
You were in them.

158
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,034
不好意思
Sorry.

159
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:04,050
我想你是不是想去走走
Thought I'd see if you wanted to go for a walk.

160
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:07,075
不了
Sorry.

161
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,039
我要...
I have to...

162
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,036
做点事
do something.

163
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:15,027
一会儿见  好么?
See you later,okay?

164
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:53,029
它会回来的
It'll come back around.

165
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,048
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

166
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,050
全是一只野猪干的?
A boar did all this?

167
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,026
昨晚  它毁了我的帐篷
Last night,he wrecked my tent.

168
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:32,001
今天早上 当我去拿回我的帐篷的时候
This morning,when I went to get my tent back,

169
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,060
它从后面攻击了我
it attacks me from behind,

170
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,020
然后像个懦夫一样跑进了丛林
runs off into the jungle like a coward.

171
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,062
野猪不会无缘无故地攻击你
A  boar wouldn't just attack you for no reason.

172
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,032
谢了  野猪专家
Thank you,boar expert.

173
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,083
这只就是这样的
This one did.

174
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,022
烦死我了
It's harassing me.

175
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:50,061
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

176
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,075
摆平它
Getting even.

177
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,050
你听听你自己在说些什么  只是一只野猪而已
Would you listen to yourself? It's a boar.

178
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,095
告诉Locke  他会宰了它的
Just go tell Locke,and he'll kill it.

179
00:12:58,004 --> 00:12:59,061
不 我要亲自宰了它
Nope. This is my fight.

180
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,075
你知道怎么狩猎野猪么
Do you know anything about hunting boar?

181
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,095
你会迷路甚至更糟
You are gonna get yourself lost or worse.

182
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:07,033
你从什么时候开始关心我了?
Since when do you care?

183
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,052
我没有
I don't.

184
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,099
很好  那么对不起了
Good. Then if you'll excuse me,

185
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,006
我准备去报仇
I've got some revenge to tend to.

186
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:43,067
你肯定是Hibbs的同伴
You must be Hibbs's mate.

187
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,034
我回美国后和Hibbs一起干了一些事
I did a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States.

188
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,099
够了吧  伙计
Nice enough fella.

189
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,038
-他是个混蛋  -对  他的确是
-He's a son of a bitch.  -Right. Indeed he is.

190
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,033
有一些免责声明
A few disclaimers.

191
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:58,060
澳大利亚不允许居民携带手枪
Australia doesn't allow its citizens to carry handguns.

192
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,025
你挑挑看这个的毛病...
You get nicked with this...

193
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,092
我不想让你颜面尽失
I'm not gonna rat you out.

194
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:08,000
还有你知道的 我已经做了一段时间了
Secondly,you know,I've been doing this for a while,

195
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:12,002
一个人买了把带空心弹夹的紧凑型USP357SIG
and a man who buys a compact .357 with hollow-point loads --

196
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,039
他不准备去吓人或是偷东西
he's not looking to scare or steal.

197
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,080
他是去杀人
He's looking to kill.

198
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,014
直到了杀人的时候
But  when it comes down to it,

199
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,094
他却发现自己没有勇气下手
if he finds he doesn't have what it takes to do the job...

200
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:22,018
你还要改进你的买卖程度
Your sales pitch needs some work.

201
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,076
我要说的是...
What I'm saying is...

202
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,067
你看着一个人并且拿枪指着他
you look a man in the eye and you point a gun at him,

203
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,069
你知道你真正是谁了  伙计
you find who you really are,mate.

204
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,099
如果你发现你不是一个杀手的话 是没有退款的
And should you find you're not a killer,there's no refund.

205
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,070
这不是问题
It won't be a problem.

206
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,037
Hurley

207
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:41,095
很感谢你的帮忙
I appreciate the help

208
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,069
但是你不需要这么做...
but you don't have to...

209
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,039
我杀了Ethan
I killed Ethan.

210
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:46,094
我能埋了他
I can bury him.

211
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,073
是的  直到他复活
Yeah,until he rises from the dead.

212
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:52,093
伙计  我知道这会怎样
Dude,I know how this works.

213
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:54,043
这会毁了我和你
This is gonna end with you and me

214
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:56,042
跑过丛林  叫喊  哭喊
running through the jungle,screaming and crying.

215
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,051
他会先抓到我  因为我很重而且
He catches me first because I'm heavy and

216
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,015
我抽筋了
I get cramps.

217
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,080
你还好么?
Are you all right?

218
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:31,002
你好 Sayid
Yo. Sayid.

219
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,075
我能问你个问题么?
Can I ask you a question?

220
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,017
当然
Of course.

221
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,043
你得过海湾战争综合症么?
Did you ever get that Gulf War syndrome?

222
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,058
那是另一个方面
That was the other side.

223
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,066
对
right.

224
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:46,084
其中一部分像是炮弹休克?
Then what's the one where they're all,like,shell-shocked?

225
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,053
外伤后的压力紊乱
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

226
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:50,012
对  就是这个  你得过么?
Yeah,that's it. Did you ever have that?

227
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:51,038
你为什么这么问?
Why do you ask?

228
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,063
因为我担心Charlie
Because I'm worried about Charlie.

229
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,033
Charlie怎么了?
What's wrong with Charlie?

230
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,009
我是说  他杀了个人
I mean,he killed a guy.

231
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:59,028
他向他胸口开了四枪
He shot him in the chest four times

232
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,035
或许你能找他谈谈?
Maybe you should talk to him?

233
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:19,058
是个脚印
It's a footprint.

234
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:25,029
基于这个重量和步幅的宽度 我说...
Based on the weight and the distance between strides,I'd say...

235
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,048
你一直在跟着Boone约摸有一个小时了
you've been following Boone for about an hour.

236
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,041
看...
Look...

237
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,044
我猜可能是Charlie
Could be Charlie,I suppose.

238
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,030
我对你这么关心我的事感到很好笑
I'm tickled you have taken such an interest in my affairs.

239
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,055
真的
I really am.

240
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,053
所以不要以个人的观点来处事 当我说...
So don't take it personal when I tell you to go...

241
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,006
-我要全权委托  -什么?
-I want carte blanche.  -What?

242
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,080
没我的帮忙你根本找不到这只野猪
You can't track this boar without my help.

243
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,021
过去的几个小时...
Over the last few hours...

244
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:47,036
你只是在设法跟踪人和鸟
you have managed to follow the tracks of humans,birds,

245
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:52,015
岩石的滑动 你自己... 基本上跟野猪都没什么关系
a rock slide,yourself --basically everything except boar.

246
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,063
你不知道你在做什么
You have no idea what you're doing.

247
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:57,023
全权委托...
Carte blanche...

248
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,014
意味着空白支票
It means "blank check."

249
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,038
我知道它的意思
I know what it means.

250
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:02,034
每次我从你隐蔽的地方找到...药 肥皂 无论什么...
Anytime I want something from your stash...medicine,soap,whatever

251
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,028
我都得到了 从没问过什么
I get it,no questions asked.

252
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,018
带走或留着
Take it or leave it.

253
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,083
好吧
All right

254
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,090
做个交易
You got a deal.

255
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,026
-你在什么地方拿到的?  -飞机上
-Where'd you get that?  -The plane.

256
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:35,099
Jack正在找这瓶酒
Jack was looking for the liquor cart.

257
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,031
我找到了个代替的 不是很好么  嗯?
It's a good thing I found it instead then?

258
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,081
那还有么?
Got any more of those?

259
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,038
我每样东西都还有很多
I got a lot more of everything,

260
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,028
但你还不能全权委托
but you ain't got carte blanche yet.

261
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,048
那就是表示不行了?
Is that a no?

262
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,031
好了 Sassafras
All right,Sassafras.

263
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:59,002
但是如若你想喝的话  你得玩个游戏
But if you want a drink,you gotta play.

264
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,009
玩什么?
Play what?

265
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:01,034
"我从来不..."的一种游戏(一个喝酒游戏)
I never.

266
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,046
什么?
What?

267
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,034
我从来不
I never.

268
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,092
我能知道那是什么意思吗
Am I supposed to know what that means?

269
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,007
就叫它增进相互了解的方法吧
Call it a way to get to know each other better.

270
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:15,073
比如
For example,

271
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:17,093
我知道你从没上过大学
I know you've never been to college.

272
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,034
你怎么知道的?
And how do you know that?

273
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:21,048
如果你去了 你肯定听过"我从来没有"
If you had,you'd have heard of "I never."

274
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,032
这很简单
It's simple.

275
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:27,084
你说"我从来没有" 然后你说完整个句子
You say "I never," and then you finish the sentence.

276
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,008
如果是你做过的话  你就喝一口酒
If it's something you did,you drink.

277
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:31,035
如果你没做过的话
If it's something you never did

278
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,073
你就不能喝
you don't drink.

279
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,086
那真是没意思
That makes absolutely no sense.

280
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,037
举个例子
Learn by example.

281
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,057
我从没吻过男人
I never kissed a man.

282
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,059
现在你可以喝了
Now you drink

283
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,088
因为你吻过男人
cause you've kissed a man.

284
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,038
该你了
cause you've kissed a man.

285
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,020
我从没暗示过我上过大学 事实也是我从没上过
I never implied that I've been to college when I never have.

286
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,079
我没去过迪士尼乐园
I never been to Disneyland.

287
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,028
真可怜
that's just sad

288
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,080
我从没穿戴过粉色的衣物
I never wore pink.

289
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,084
我知道
I knew it.

290
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,080
-80年代的  -恩 是的
-The '80s.  -Mm-hmm.

291
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,013
我从没选过民主党人
I never voted democrat.

292
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,062
我从没选过
I never voted.

293
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:37,038
我从没谈过恋爱
I never voted.

294
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,084
你从没谈过恋爱?
You've never been in love?

295
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,092
我没喝  不是么?
I ain't drinking,am I?

296
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,026
我从未有过一夜情
I've never had a one-night stand.

297
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,096
干了  水手
Bottom's up,sailor.

298
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,019
我得为每句话都喝么?
I gotta drink for each one?

299
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,010
该你了
Your turn.

300
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,016
我从没结过婚
I never been married.

301
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,012
那并没持续多久
It didn't last very long.

302
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:17,067
我从没把问题都发泄到野猪头上去
I've never blamed a boar for all my problems.

303
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,073
我从没担心过拥有全权委托
I never cared about having carte blanche

304
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,072
因为我只是想消磨一点时间
cause I just wanted to spend some time

305
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,075
和在这个岛上唯一的另一个人一起
with the only other person on this island

306
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:34,078
那并不合适
that just don't belong.

307
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,007
我从没随身携带一封信20年之久
I never carried a letter around for 20 years

308
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,012
因为我的包放不下
because I couldn't get over my baggage.

309
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,059
我从没杀过人
I never killed a man.

310
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:40,093
这...
Well...

311
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,068
看来我们还是有些共同点的
it looks like we got something in common after all.

312
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:08,067
它会回来的
It'll come back around.

313
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,046
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

314
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,026
你在发抖
You're shaking.

315
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,040
我很好
I'm fine.

316
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,053
我只是有点...
I was just having a...

317
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,041
不敢相信
I can't believe this.

318
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,075
到处都是蹄印
There are hoof marks everywhere.

319
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:41,026
它吃了我们所有的东西?
It ate all our stuff?

320
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:43,038
不  它只吃了你的东西
Nope. It ate your stuff.

321
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,015
我的还在
Mine's fine.

322
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:50,006
那野猪一定会受到惩罚  我向天发誓...
that hogis gonna suffer. I swear to god...

323
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:01,069
早上好
Morning.

324
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,098
你们的野营地怎么了?
What happened to your campsite?

325
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,024
你从那么远跑来干什么  John?
So,what are you doing all the way out here,John?

326
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,058
做坠机的营救工作
Looking for salvage from the crash.

327
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,092
找到有用的么?
Find anything useful?

328
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:20,094
特殊的金属片...两袋咖啡
The occasional scrap of metal... two bags of coffee.

329
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:24,093
我沿着你的路回走了一英里找到的  我该跟你打个招呼吧
I picked up your path about a mile back. I thought I'd say howdy.

330
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,078
狗娘的  
son of a...

331
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,029
他在我衬衫上撒尿
He peed on my shirt.

332
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,075
他把我衬衫从袋子里拉出来后 还在上面撒尿
He took my shirt out of the bag and peed on it.

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,059
你说这不是针对个人的
And you say this ain't personal.

334
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,045
他认为我们跟踪的野猪和他有深仇大恨
He thinks the boar we're after has a vendetta against him.

335
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,040
它攻击我三次了
That's three times it's attacked me.

336
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,012
可能它闻到了你的味道 不喜欢你的古龙水
Maybe it's got your scent. Doesn't like your cologne.

337
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,038
我不喷古龙水
I don't wear cologne.

338
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,062
不对 你喷的
Yes,you do.

339
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,054
好吧  呃...
Yeah,well...

340
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,013
问题是他是冲着我来的
the thing's got it in for me!

341
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,064
只是只野猪  Sawyer
It's a boar,Sawyer.

342
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:59,065
我妹妹Jeannie在我还小的时候就死了
My sister Jeannie died when I was a boy.

343
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:04,046
她摔下了猴栏扭断了脖子
She fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck.

344
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,093
我的母亲  呃  我的养母
And my mother...well,my foster mother...

345
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,012
她很自责  毫无疑问
she blamed herself,of course

346
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,082
认为她自己没有看紧
Thought she wasn't watching close enough.

347
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,054
所以她不吃不睡
So she stopped eating,stopped sleeping.

348
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,084
邻居们开始议论
The neighbors started talking

349
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:22,013
我猜他们怕她会对自己做些什么
afraid she might do something to herself,I guess.

350
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,076
很不错
that's good.

351
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,059
无论如何 大约在Jeannie的葬礼6个月后
Anyway,about six months after Jeannie's funeral,

352
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,068
这只金毛猎犬挡住了我们的车道
this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway,

353
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:37,048
直冲着我们家来 坐在地上
walks right into our house,sits down on the floor,

354
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,095
并且直盯盯地看着睡椅上的我的母亲
and looks right at my mother there on the couch.

355
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:42,007
我的母亲也看着它
And my mother looks back at the dog.

356
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,040
大约1分钟时间
After about a minute of this...

357
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:45,028
他们互相看着对方  就像这样
them both staring at each other like that...

358
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:49,072
我母亲泪流满面
my mother burst into tears.

359
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,087
很漂亮的狗  没有标牌 没有项圈 健康可爱
Beautiful dog --no tags,no collar. Healthy and sweet.

360
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,034
这只狗睡在Jeannie的房间 Jeannie的床上 
The dog slept in Jeannie's old room on Jeannie's old bed

361
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:04,068
并一直和我们呆在一起 直到我母亲5年后去世
and stayed with us until my mother passed five years later,

362
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,098
然后消失了  回到...
then disappeared back to...

363
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,002
无论哪里  反正回到她原来呆着的地方
wherever it was she came from in the first place.

364
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:17,012
那么... 你说这只狗是你妹妹?
So... you're saying the dog was your sister?

365
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:19,093
虽然那很愚蠢
that would be silly.

366
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:23,037
但我母亲认为是
But my mother thought it was.

367
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:26,018
认为Jeannie回来告诉她
Thought that Jeannie had come back to tell her

368
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:28,063
这事故不是她的错
the accident wasn't her fault

369
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,044
让她摆脱自责
let her off the hook.

370
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,067
你的外卖
You're good to go.

371
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:33,026
温合口味的沙司虾或辣沙司虾
Only two choices --shrimp in mild sauce,shrimp in hot sauce.

372
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:51,005
我要辣的
I'll go with the hot.

373
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,081
好  辣的
Hot it is.

374
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:04,026
你是美国的 是吗
a fellow American,huh?

375
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,045
是的
Good for you.

376
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:07,043
你错过了午餐高峰
You missed the lunch rush.

377
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:13,029
你从哪儿来?
Whereabouts you from?

378
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,054
田纳西州
Tennessee.

379
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,069
我喜欢南部
I love the south.

380
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:22,087
想念南部的女人
Miss those southern women.

381
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:28,044
来澳大利亚很久了?
Been in Australia long?

382
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,025
没多久
Not really.

383
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:32,050
好消息
For what it's worth,

384
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,014
我们卡车里有特价
we have a special at the truck here...

385
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,011
美国人一律半价
half-price for all Americans.

386
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,087
顺便说一下  我叫Frank
Name's Frank,by the way.

387
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,019
James

388
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:56,004
很高兴见到你  James
Good to meet you,James.

389
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:11,089
一份辣沙司虾...
One  shrimp in hot sauce...

390
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,083
又一次了
Again.

391
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,038
你很肯定么  伙计?
Are you sure about that,mate?

392
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:30,067
又一次了
Again.

393
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:32,098
你告诉他  小子
You tell him,cowboy.

394
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:36,057
这些混蛋以为美国人控制不了自己的酒量
These bastards think Americans can't hold their liquor.

395
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:40,044
看 我
Look,I

396
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:44,077
我讨厌罢手 但好像我把我钱包放错地方了
I hate to hold my hand out,but I seem to have misplaced my wallet.

397
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,059
把他弄好
Set him up.

398
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:50,084
和你喝一杯
I drink to you.

399
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:53,047
小子  你叫什么?
What's your name,cowboy?

400
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,070
Sawyer

401
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,067
向Sawyer干杯
To Sawyer.

402
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,022
愿他找到在杯子底的他想找的东西
May he find whatever he's looking for at the bottom of a glass.

403
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:07,012
那么  Sawyer...
So,Sawyer...

404
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:09,060
你为什么来悉尼的?
what brings you to Sydney?

405
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:14,016
工作需要
Business.

406
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,073
你知道为什么大家把澳大利亚叫做"下下之地"么?
You know why they call australia "down under," don't you?

407
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,044
因为它跟地狱差不多近
Because it's as close as you can get to hell

408
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,016
但不会烧着
without being burned.

409
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:33,095
过来吧  伙计
How about you leave the bottle,slim?

410
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:46,083
你在美国是做什么的?
So,what's your handle back in the states?

411
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,051
我曾经是一个...
I was a...

412
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,020
外科主刀医生
chief of surgery.

413
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,065
曾经?
Was?

414
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:57,018
是的，曾经
Yeah,I was.

415
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:01,037
这么说我们身处地狱?
So we're in hell?

416
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:04,031
别让这里的环境迷惑了你  伙计
Don't let the air conditioning fool you,son.

417
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:06,010
你也在这儿
You are here,too.

418
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,068
并且你在苦难中
And you are suffering.

419
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:15,080
但是别为此折磨你自己
But don't beat yourself up about it.

420
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,005
这是命运
It's fate.

421
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,072
一些人命该受难
Some people are just supposed to suffer.

422
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:25,045
这就是为什么红袜队从没赢过可恶的赛季
That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn series.

423
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:36,092
我有一个儿子  他和你差不多大
I have a son --he's about your age.

424
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:40,045
他和我不一样
He's not like me.

425
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:43,018
他做他想做的事
He does what's in his heart.

426
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,020
他是个好人
He's a good man.

427
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,015
可能很伟大
Maybe a great one.

428
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,023
现在..
And right now...

429
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,037
他认为我恨他
he thinks that I hate him.

430
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,015
他认为我感觉他背叛了我
He thinks I feel betrayed by him.

431
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:06,024
但是我真正感到的是...
But what I really feel...

432
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:10,057
感谢和自豪
is gratitude and pride

433
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,035
为了他对我所做的
because of what he did to me.

434
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,098
他为我所做的
What he did for me.

435
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,037
这需要比我更多的勇气
It took more courage than I have.

436
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:26,058
那有一个投币电话
There's a pay phone over here.

437
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,082
我可以用它来给我儿子打电话
I could pick it up,and I could call my son.

438
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,007
我能告诉他全部这些话
I could tell him about all of this.

439
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,004
我能告诉他我爱他
I could tell him that I love him.

440
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:42,088
一个简单的电话就能弥补一切
One simple phone call,and I could fix everything.

441
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:45,001
那你为什么不打呢?
Then why don't you?

442
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:48,098
因为我很软弱
Because I am weak.

443
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,083
这个
This

444
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:01,043
你的工作...
this business that you have...

445
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,042
能减轻你的痛苦么?
will it ease your suffering?

446
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,050
是的
Yeah.

447
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:11,021
那么你在这儿干什么?
Then what are you doing here?

448
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,010
这没这么简单
It ain't that simple.

449
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,036
当然很简单
Of course it is.

450
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:21,094
当然很简单  除非你想和我的下场一样
Unless you want to end up like me,of course it is.

451
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:01,003
你很有天份
You're developing quite a talent.

452
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,058
是的
Yeah.

453
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:14,045
我知道了
I get it.

454
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,064
你是来看我的
You're here to check up on me.

455
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,072
你杀了个人
You killed a man.

456
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,076
那个人杀了我们其中一个
A man who killed one of us.

457
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,038
他绑架了Claire
Who kidnapped Claire.

458
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:27,064
他把我绑起来让我等死  他该死
Who strung me up and left me for dead. He deserved to die.

459
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:29,016
我立刻就可以再做一次
I'd do it again in a minute.

460
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,054
原谅我  我发泄了我的不快
Pardon me if I'm fresh out of bad feeling.

461
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:39,005
当我在伊拉克Tikrit的军队时
When I was in the army in Tikrit in Iraq,

462
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:42,026
住在我隔壁的是一个警察
the man who lived next door was a policeman.

463
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,041
有天他的车被安上了炸弹
One day his car was rigged with a bomb.

464
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:48,058
炸死了他的妻子和三个小孩
It killed his wife and three young children instead.

465
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:50,083
他们抓住了罪魁祸首
They caught the man who did it.

466
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:54,008
我志愿参加行刑队
I volunteered to be on the firing squad,

467
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,011
然后我毫不留情得履行了我的职责
and I did my duty without a single ounce of remorse.

468
00:33:58,031 --> 00:33:59,084
然后不知为什么
Then for no reason

469
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,024
我晚上醒来了
I found myself waking up at night

470
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:04,049
脑子里回忆着我所做的
replaying what I did in my head.

471
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,017
你才是那个我要找的人
Looks like you're the one who needs checking up on.

472
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:12,023
我所说的是关于Ethan的事
All I'm saying is that what happened with Ethan

473
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:14,051
这些事将会伴随你一生
will be with you for the rest of your life.

474
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:24,079
有什么建议么?
Any suggestions?

475
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,047
你并不孤单
You're not alone.

476
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:34,040
别假装孤独
Don't pretend to be.

477
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,004
让我欣慰的是有天
I take comfort knowing someday

478
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:48,022
这里会变成一个很好的购物区
this is all gonna be a real nice shopping complex

479
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:50,013
甚至可能是一个汽车购物区
Maybe even an automall.

480
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,068
你去哪儿?
Where you going?

481
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:53,066
知道那是什么么?
Know what that is?

482
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:56,074
一团泥巴洞
A whole in the mud.

483
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:58,009
一个泥坑
It's a wallow.

484
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,064
什么是泥坑?
What the hell's a wallow?

485
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,075
野猪的坑
Boar's wallow.

486
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,037
是它睡觉的巢穴
It's his den where he sleeps.

487
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:04,087
这些树上是他牙齿戳后的痕迹
And these tree rubbings from his tusks.

488
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,056
你是说它在附近?
You mean he's around here?

489
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,047
可能吧
Maybe.

490
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,056
等等  Sawyer
Wait,Sawyer.

491
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,019
抓住你了 
Gotcha!

492
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,032
我以为它会比这大
I thought it'd be bigger.

493
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:26,042
真有趣 现在我们知道它爸爸就在这附近
Funny. Now we know daddy's got to be around here.

494
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:28,005
在这儿 小猪 小猪 小猪
Here,piggy,piggy,piggy!

495
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,075
Sawyer  放下它 这不是闹着玩儿的
Sawyer,put it down! That's not funny!

496
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,032
在这儿 小猪 小猪 小猪
Here,piggy,piggy,piggy!

497
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,032
你怎么了 Sawyer?
Hey,what is the matter with you,Sawyer?

498
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,026
你会伤了它的
You're gonna hurt it!

499
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,018
我们在这儿
We're right over here!

500
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,030
-在这儿 小猪

501
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:42,085
-你有病  -我没伤害它
-You're sick.  -I didn't hurt it.

502
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:44,040
你自己回去吧
Find your own way home.

503
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,008
没问题
No problem!

504
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:04,052
Sawyer

505
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,041
我有一封你的信
I got a letter for you.

506
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,038
亲爱的Sawyer先生
"Dear Mr. Sawyer..."

507
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,027
谁?
Who?

508
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:34,071
你曾经用过Sawyer这个名字
You used to go by the name of Sawyer.

509
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,080
你究竟在说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:41,087
你不必这样做
You didn't have to.

511
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:44,085
告诉Hibbs我会给钱的
Tell Hibbs I would have paid.

512
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:47,074
你怎么知道Hibbs?
How do you know Hibbs?

513
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,069
你不...
You don't...

514
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:54,004
你不知道你在做什么  是不是?
you don't know what you're doing,do you?

515
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:57,093
你问Hibbs借过钱了?
You borrowed money from Hibbs?

516
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,053
我会还的
I was gonna pay.

517
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,059
它会回来的
It'll come back around.

518
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,099
Kate

519
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:54,092
这只是一只野猪
It's just a boar.

520
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,047
我们回营地吧
Let's get back to camp.

521
00:39:45,097 --> 00:39:47,047
现在可以去走走了吗?
Want to take that walk now?

522
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,052
好的
Sure.

523
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,083
竖起它们
Stick 'em up.

524
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:29,005
想搞笑么?
Trying to be funny?

525
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:32,013
是的
Yeah.

526
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:36,048
给你扔几个馅饼怎么样?
I was fresh out of pies to throw at you.

527
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:40,068
给你 长官
Here you go,sheriff.

528
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:43,066
我两天前就问你要了
I asked you for this two days ago.

529
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:45,031
我告诉你再忍一会儿
And I told you to stick it.

530
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,086
但是我和你女朋友达成了个协议
But I made a deal with your girlfriend.

531
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:50,029
她给了你什么?
What did she give you?

532
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,021
Kate  她给了你什么?
Kate. What did she give you?

533
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:58,094
没有  她不准备放弃
Nothing she wasn't willing to part with.

534
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,090
这就是为什么红袜队从没赢过赛季
That's why the Red Sox will never win the series.

535
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:09,013
你刚说了什么?
What'd you just say?

536
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,084
我说这就是为什么红袜队不可能赢整个赛季
I said that's why the Red Sox will never win the series.

537
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:14,098
这究竟是什么意思?
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

538
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:17,090
这是我爸老说的
It's just something my father used to say

539
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:21,054
所以他可以用一生来知道人们恨他
so he could go through life knowing that people hated him.

540
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:25,090
并且他只是用命运来搪塞 推卸责任
Instead of taking responsibility for it,he just put it on fate.

541
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,055
说是这是注定的
Said he was made that way.

542
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,076
你爸爸...
Your daddy...

543
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,074
也是一个医生?
he a doctor,too?

544
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:37,018
是的
Was.

545
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:39,079
他死了
He's dead.

546
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,045
你为什么想了解我的爸爸?
Why do you want to know about my father?

547
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:01,050
没什么
No reason.

548
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:20,060
