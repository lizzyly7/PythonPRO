3
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,089
天哪
Oh, my God!

4
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,049
Walt! Walt!

5
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:33,041
离机油远点儿  在那别动
Stay away from the gas! Stay there!

6
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,050
救命  救命
Help! Help!

7
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,038
救命啊
Somebody, help me!

8
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:52,089
救命  救命
Help, help!

9
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,060
我的腿
Oh, my leg!

10
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,052
过来  帮我一下
Hey, get over here. Give me a hand.

11
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,053
过来  帮我一下
You, come on! Come over here! Give me a hand!

12
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,053
数三下一起用力
On the count of three.

13
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:13,074
一 二 三
One, two, three!

14
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:37,039
救命  救救我
Help me! Please, help me!

15
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,077
把他抬走  离引擎远点儿
Get him out of here. Get him away from the engine.

16
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,052
把他抬走
Get him out of here.

17
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:52,053
救救我! 请救救我! 我开始宫缩了
Help me! Please, help me. I'm having contractions!

18
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,075
怀孕几个月了
How many months pregnant are you?

19
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,045
八个月
Only eight months.

20
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,008
间隔时间呢
How far apart are they coming?

21
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,087
不知道  这是头一次
I don't know, a few just happened!

22
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:03,050
快躲开
Hey! Get away from there!

23
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,075
听我说
Listen to me!

24
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,031
看着我  你会没事的  知道吗
Look at me! You're gonna be okay. Do you understand me?

25
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,056
但你必须坐着别动
But you have to sit absolutely still.

26
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,065
你  过来
Hey! You! Come here!

27
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,011
让她离这些烟远点儿 
I need you to get this woman away from these fumes.

28
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,078
带她到那边去  陪着她
Take her there. Stay with her.

29
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:37,028
如果宫缩频率接近三分钟就叫我
If her contractions occur closer than three minutes, call me!

30
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,078
不是吧
You gotta be kidding me.

31
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:39,042
我马上就回来  好吗
I'll be right back.

32
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:41,012
谢谢你
Thank you.

33
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:44,029
你叫什么名字啊
Hey! What's your name?

34
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:46,050
Jack!

35
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:52,071
停 她头部后仰不够  气都送到了她胃里
Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough. You're blowing into her stomach.

36
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,046
你肯定吗
You sure?

37
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,068
我刚才就是这么做的啊
That's exactly what I was doing.

38
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,001
我是救生员  有执照的
I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.

39
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,085
你该考虑一下把那执照还回去了
You need to think about giving that license back.

40
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:02,026
也许我们该试一下插孔
Maybe we should do one of those hole things.

41
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:04,021
用钢笔在喉部插孔
Stick the pen in the throat?

42
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,023
好主意呀  你给我找个钢笔去
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.

43
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,069
谁有钢笔  有钢笔吗
Does anyone have any pens? Do you have a pen?

44
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:22,062
醒过来  醒过来
Come on! Come on!

45
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,038
深呼吸
Big deep breaths.

46
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,034
深呼吸
Big breaths.

47
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:49,031
离开那儿  离开那儿
Move! Move! Move!

48
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:51,027
带她离开  带她离开那儿  走开啊!
Get her up! Get her out of there! Go away!

49
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,047
没事吧
You okay?

50
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,047
恩
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,068
你呢
You?

52
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,089
陪着她
Stay with her.

53
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,060
老兄  这还用说
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.

54
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:15,060
不知道哪个最好用
I didn't know which one would work best.

55
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,094
都不错
They're all OK.

56
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,040
谢了
Thanks.

57
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,029
不好意思
Excuse me.

58
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,076
你用过针吗
Did you ever use a needle?

59
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,068
什么
What?

60
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:17,060
你缝过牛仔裤吗
Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?

61
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,060
我...
I, uh...

62
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,098
我在家做过窗帘
I made the drapes in my apartment.

63
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,094
好极了  听我说
That's fantastic. Listen...

64
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,028
有时间能帮我个忙吗
Do you have a second? I could use a little help here.

65
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,095
什么忙
Help with what?

66
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,095
这个
With this.

67
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,029
我是一名医生 本可以自己来的  可够不到...
I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.

68
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,015
你想让我缝那伤口吗
You want me to sew that?

69
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,025
就像是缝窗帘一样
Like the drapes.

70
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,008
不  我是用缝纫机缝的窗帘
No, I used a sewing machine.

71
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,038
不  你行的  真的
No, you can do this, I'm telling you.

72
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,017
如果你不介意的话
If you wouldn't mind.

73
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,064
当然可以
Of course I will.

74
00:10:58,064 --> 00:10:59,064
多谢了
Thank you.

75
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:06,085
给你的手消毒
It's for your hand.

76
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,082
给我留些  给伤口消毒
Save me some... for there...for the wound.

77
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,054
对颜色有要求吗
Any color preference?

78
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,004
没有  标准黑颜色
No. Standard black.

79
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:43,083
嘿  你
Hey, you!

80
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,070
叫什么名字
What's your name?

81
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,075
我吗  Charlie
Me? Charlie.

82
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,088
Charlie 帮忙生火  火光不够大就没人会发现我们
Charlie, we need help with the fire. No one will see it if it isn't big.

83
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,079
好  交给我吧
Okay, I'm on it.

84
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,079
你的名字呢
What's your name?

85
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,055
Sayid.

86
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,005
交给我吧  Sayid
Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.

87
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,056
我可能会吐你一身
I might throw up on you.

88
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,027
你干的不错
You're doing fine.

89
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,094
你看起来一点儿也不害怕
You don't seem afraid at all.

90
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,028
我不明白
I don't understand that.

91
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:26,075
恐惧算是一件怪异的事
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.

92
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,017
在我实习的时候 
When I was in residency,

93
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:37,017
我第一次主刀是为一名16岁孩子作脊柱手术
my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16-year-old kid.

94
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,038
一个女孩子
A girl.

95
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:46,040
在13个小时以后  临近结束的时候  在我缝合的时候
And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I...

96
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,077
我不小心撕开了她的硬膜腔
I accidentally ripped her dural sack.

97
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:53,010
神经集中的脊柱基部被弄碎了
It's at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together.

98
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,044
隔膜  隔膜组织
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...

99
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,065
都被撕开了
So it ripped open.

100
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:05,012
神经像细意大利面一样散出
Nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta,

101
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,012
脊髓液流了出来
spinal fluid flowing out of her and I...

102
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:26,001
感觉如此恐怖...真实  可我知道我必须去面对
The terror was just so...crazy, so real...and I knew I had to deal with it.

103
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,064
于是我做出了一个选择
So I just made a choice.

104
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:34,019
我让恐惧侵袭我全身  让它令我惊慌失措
I'd let the fear in. Let it take over. Let it do its thing.

105
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,098
但我只给它五秒钟  就这么多
But only for five seconds, that's all I was gonna give it.

106
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,019
然后我开始记数
So I started to count.

107
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:47,082
一  二  三  四  五
One, two, three, four, five.

108
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,045
然后恐惧感消失了
And it was gone.

109
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:58,004
我重返工作  缝好了她  她没事了
I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.

110
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:04,076
换作是我的话  我早就夺门而出了
If that had been me, I think I would've run for the door.

111
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,055
我看不会
No, I don't think that's true.

112
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:14,002
你现在并没跑掉啊
You're not running now.

113
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:27,028
宿命

114
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,062
你以为他们现在就该到了
You think they would have come by now.

115
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,083
什么  谁呀
Hmm? Who?

116
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,054
任何人
Anyone.

117
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,081
真以为我会吃巧克力吗
As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.

118
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:04,044
Shannon  我们可能要留在这一段时间了
Shannon, we may be here for a while.

119
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,070
飞机有黑匣子  白痴
The plane had a black box, idiot.

120
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:09,091
他们知道我们在哪儿  他们会来的
They know exactly where we are, they're coming.

121
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,079
我会在救生艇上吃
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

122
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:18,067
我会在救生艇上吃
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

123
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,011
饿吗
Hungry?

124
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,081
恩  谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

125
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:40,011
身体还有情况吗
Any more...you know, baby stuff?

126
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:43,040
没有了  没事了
No... I'm okay.

127
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,037
挺住
Well, hang in there.

128
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,007
恩  你也是
Yeah, you too.

129
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,025
够暖了吗
You sure you're warm enough?

130
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:17,026
你不能走出我的视线

131
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,036
我走到哪儿都要跟着我

132
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:23,046
知道吗

133
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:31,006
别理会他人  我们要呆在一起

134
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,009
他能活吗
Do you think he's gonna live?

135
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,097
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

136
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,039
他坐我边上
He was sitting next to me.

137
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:10,015
事发当时我们一定在四万英尺高空
We must've been at about 40,000 feet when it happened.

138
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:17,057
撞到了一个气阱  然后下落了大概...二百英尺
We hit an air pocket and dropped...maybe 200 feet.

139
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,095
紊流...
The turbulence was...

140
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:27,046
我昏了过去
I blacked out.

141
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:31,055
我没有
I didn't.

142
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,030
我看到了事发经过
I saw the whole thing.

143
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,056
我知道机尾没了  可我...就是没有勇气向后看
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...couldn't bring myself to look back.

144
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:51,040
然后...飞机前端脱落
And then the front end of the plane broke off.

145
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,078
却没落在沙滩这里
Well, it's not here on the beach.

146
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,087
尾部也没有
Neither is the tail.

147
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:02,054
我们要查明从哪个方向坠地的
We need to figure out which way we came in.

148
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,054
为什么
Why?

149
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,071
因为那样就有机会找到驾驶舱
There's a chance we find the cockpit.

150
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,084
如果它完好无损  就有可能找到无线电收发机
If it's intact, we might be able to find the transceiver.

151
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:12,013
然后我们就能发射信号  协助救援队找到我们
We could send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.

152
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,051
你怎么知道的这么多
How do you know all that?

153
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:18,030
上过几堂飞行课
I took a couple of flying lessons.

154
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:21,018
不是自愿的
Wasn't for me.

155
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:30,006
我看到了一些烟雾  在山谷那边
I saw some smoke...just through the valley.

156
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:37,099
如果你想去找那驾驶舱  我要和你一起去
If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.

157
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,050
我还不知道你的名字
I don't know your name.

158
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,082
我叫Kate
I'm Kate.

159
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,022
我是Jack
Jack.

160
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:13,032
什么东西
What was that?

161
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,095
奇怪啊
That was weird, right?

162
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,028
是Vincent吗
Is that Vincent?

163
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,058
不是Vincent
It's not Vincent.

164
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:29,004
看见了吗
Did anybody see that?

165
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,063
恩
Yeah.

166
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,005
Boone!

167
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,037
可怕极了
Terrific.

168
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,022
酒怎么样
So, how's the drink?

169
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,051
不错
It's good.

170
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,089
反应不强烈呀
That wasn't a very strong reaction.

171
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,097
度数不够高
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

172
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,056
不要告诉别人
Just don't tell anyone.

173
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:44,086
这显然有违联邦航空局的重要规章吧
This, of course, breaks some critical FAA regulations.

174
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,006
借过
Excuse me.

175
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:20,002
先生  等等
Sir, excuse me!

176
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,056
看来他真是憋不住了
Guess he really had to go.

177
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,019
先生  等等
Sir, excuse me!

178
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,024
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlment

179
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,062
机长已经打开了"安全带"指示灯
The pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

180
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,050
请返回您的座位并系好安全带
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.

181
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,096
正常情况
It's normal.

182
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:51,080
我知道  只是我坐飞机就没好受过
Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier.

183
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,068
我老公一直提醒我说飞机想上高空
My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.

184
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,026
听起来他很有见地啊
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

185
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:01,035
等他从洗手间回来后  我会把这话转告给他的
Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.

186
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,015
他回来前我会陪你
Well, I'll keep you company until he does.

187
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:12,053
别担心  会过去的
Don't worry. It's gonna be over...

188
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:55,074
听起来像是动物
It didn't sound like an animal, not exactly.

189
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:59,065
那声音总是让我觉得似曾相识
I keep thinking there was something familiar about it.

190
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:00,077
你从哪来的
Where you from?

191
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,037
布朗克斯
Bronx.

192
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:02,029
也许是猴子
Monkeys.

193
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,029
对  这里是猴岛  
Monkey Island. Don't know if we're on an island...

194
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,033
准备好了吗
You ready?

195
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,030
凯特  告诉我烟从哪来  我自己去
You showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.

196
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,039
我要去
I'm coming.

197
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:24,002
那你可要换双好鞋
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

198
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,079
无论那是什么  都不是自然界的
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.

199
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,096
谁有防晒霜吗
Does anyone have any sunblock?

200
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,054
恩  我这有
Yes I do.

201
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,088
我刚看了机舱里面
So I was just looking inside the fuselage.

202
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:40,014
挺可怕的
It's pretty grim in there.

203
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:46,072
我们是否该对那些...尸体采取点措施呢
You think we should do something about the...B-O-D-Y-S?

204
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,073
你说什么那  哥们儿  尸体吗
What are you spelling, man, "bodies"?

205
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,044
尸体
B-O-D-I-E-S.

206
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,044
好主意
That sounds like a good idea.

207
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:57,049
不  他们来了以后会处理的
No, they'll deal with it when they get here.

208
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:59,099
我要去找驾驶舱了
I'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit.

209
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:01,045
看是否能找到无线电收发机  发射求救信号
See if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal.

210
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,045
协助救援队
Help the rescue team.

211
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:06,037
你要照料一下伤员
You need to keep an eye on the wounded.

212
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,087
如果穿西装的人醒了 叫他冷静
If the guy in the suit wakes up, keep him calm,

213
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:11,084
不要让他拔出那碎片  知道吗
but don't let him remove that shrapnel. Understand?

214
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,004
恩  好的
Got it.

215
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:15,014
那腿部受伤的那个人呢  止血带呢
What about the guy with the leg? The tourniquet...?

216
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,059
止住血了  昨晚取下来了
I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night.

217
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,084
他应该没事了
He should be all right.

218
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,059
恩  没问题  干的好
Yeah, cool. Good job.

219
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:24,035
我也去帮帮忙
I'll come with. I wanna help.

220
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,043
不  不需要帮忙了
I don't need any more help.

221
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:29,018
不  没关系  我不喜欢无所事事
No, it's cool. I don't really feel like standing still, so...

222
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:32,094
好极了
Excellent.

223
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:40,099
能问你些事吗
Can I ask you something?

224
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,032
问我吗  荣幸至致  一直等着呢
Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.

225
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,095
我们见过面吗
Have we ever met anywhere?

226
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:51,025
没有  不太可能
No. That would be unlikely.

227
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,018
可看起来面熟  是吧
I look familiar though, right?

228
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:55,038
恩
Yeah.

229
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:57,084
对不上号了吧
You can't quite place it?

230
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,084
恩  对不上
No, I can't.

231
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:01,080
恩  我知道了
Yeah, I think I know.

232
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:03,022
是吗
You do?

233
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,064
没听过这首歌吗
Never heard that song?

234
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:11,090
听过  就是不知道
I've heard it. I don't know what that...

235
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,000
我们唱的啊  "驱动轴 "
That's us! Drive Shaft!

236
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,011
看这戒指
The ring.

237

在芬兰的第二场巡演

你没听说过"驱动轴 "吗
Never heard of Drive Shaft?

239
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:18,016

The band?

是啊  乐队
Yeah, the band.

241

第三首歌  我是和音

00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:27,053
我朋友Beth会疯掉的  她爱死你们了
My friend Beth would freak. She loves you guys.

246
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,012
把Beth电话号码给我  我很乐意电话她
Give me Beth's number, I'll call. I'd love to.

你听说过"驱动轴"吗
You ever heard of Drive Shaft?

248
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,075
我们得继续走了
We gotta keep moving.

249
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:42,055
他们以前很不错
They were good.

250
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:45,097
他们现在也很不错  还没解散呢
They are good. Still together.

251
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,035
即将复出
We're in the middle of a comeback.

252
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,000
伙计们  这算是正常吗
You guys, is this normal?

253
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:22,059
白天变成了黑夜
Kind of day turning into night,

254
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:24,059
世界末日一样的天气
You know, end of the world-type weather.

255
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:25,068
伙计们
Is this...Guys?

00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:41,057
你可不想去那里面  太多尸体了

257
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,084
又来了
There it is again.

258
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,063
天哪
Oh, my God.

259
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:55,056
我们走吧
Well, let's do this.

260
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:32,074
我们来拿无线电...
Let's get this trans...

261
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,064
无线电收发机
Transceiver.

262
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,024
无线电收发机  然后就离开
Transceiver thing and get out of here.

263
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:39,089
开门  开门
Come on!

264
00:31:46,077 --> 00:31:47,098

00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:58,078
我没事  Charlie没事  顺便说一句  我没事
I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. I'm okay.

268
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
你不用上来
Hey, you don't have to come up here.

269
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,099
不  没关系
No, I'm good.

270
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:28,002
无线电收发机是什么样子
So, what does a transceiver look like?

271
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,019
结构复杂的对讲机
Like a complicated walkie-talkie.

272
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:08,056
听到我说话了吗
Hey, can you hear me?

273
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:12,015
把水拿来
I need that water.

274
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,049
给
Here. Here you go.

275
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,062
多少生还者
How many survived?

276
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:28,062
至少48人
At least 48.

277
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,083
身上有骨折吗
Does anything feel broken?

278
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:35,013
不  就是我的头...有点晕  仅此而已
No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.

279
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,088
可能是脑震荡
It's probably a concussion.

280
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,089
已经过了多久了
How long has it been?

281
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,059
16个小时
Sixteen hours.

282
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:44,059
16个?
Sixteen?

283
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:48,030
有人来了吗
Has anybody come?

284
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,010
还没有
Not yet.

285
00:33:53,077 --> 00:34:00,002
起飞六小时后  我们的无线电失灵了
Six hours in...our radio went out.

286
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:02,086
没人看得见我们
No one could see us.

287
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:07,024
我们掉头去斐济降落
We turned back to land in Fiji.

288
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:14,075
但遇到了紊流  偏离了航线一千英里
By the time we hit turbulence...we were a thousand miles off course.

289
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:20,009
他们搜救我们找错地方了
They're looking for us in the wrong place.

290
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,060
这里有无线电收发机
We have a transceiver.

291
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:30,018
好  这正是我们所希望的
Good, good. We were hoping.

292
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,022
你最好别动
You shouldn't move.

293
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:33,002
不  我没事
No, no. I'm okay.

294
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:34,090
无线电收发机就在哪里
Transceiver's right there.

295
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:36,023
就在那里
It's right there.

296
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,045
Charlie在哪儿
Where's Charlie?

297
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:55,029
不好用了
It's not working.

298
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,038
Charlie?

299
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:09,085
你在洗手间里做什么
What were you doing in the bathroom?

300
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,031
什么
What?

301
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,044
是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

302
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,032
Kate.

303
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,083
就在外面
It's right outside.

304
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,029
什么  什么在外面
What? What's right out...?

305
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,001
刚才发生了什么事
What the hell just happened?

306
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:53,053
Jack  快
Jack, come on!

307
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,037
别去管它了
Just leave it!

308
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,068
快跑
Okay, run!

309
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,044
Jack!

310
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,056
一
One.

311
