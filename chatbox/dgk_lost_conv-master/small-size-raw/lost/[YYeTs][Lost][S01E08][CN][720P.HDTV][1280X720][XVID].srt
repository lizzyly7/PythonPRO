写的是 我的性感女郎
It's about bunnies.

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,003
泳衣也不穿一定很冷吧
It must be cold without your trunks.

00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,011
那当然
You bet.

7

靠近一点给我暖暖身子怎样?
How about you come a little closer and warm me up?

8
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,033
你很擅长于给女孩子带来新奇感  Sawyer

你真让人不可思议  Sawyer

看看你

现在你想要什么?
What do you want right now?

13
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,049
我怎么可能还会奢望其它东西?
How could I want anything else?

14
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:51,034
-宝贝儿  -什么?

-你不是有个会议吗!  -有 但3:30再开呢
-I thought you had a meeting.  -Yeah, but it's not till 3:30.

16
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,055
宝贝儿已经3:28了
Baby, it's 3:28.

17
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,010
该死!
Damn it!

18
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:04,064
该死! 宝贝儿  为什么你不...
Damn it! Baby, why don't you just...

19
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:08,006
你去吧  你就走吧? 我呆在这儿

20
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:10,090
我可以叫客房服务好好把自己吃胖
Order room service, get fat.

21
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,090
为什么不点个巧克力圣代?
Why don't you order a chocolate sundae.

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,057
我回来的时候
When I get back

23
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,065
我会把你当点心吃
I'll use you as a dish

24
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,096
这真不应该被你看到
You weren't exactly supposed to see that.

25
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,012
你翻我东西干什么  小子?
What're you doing in my stuff, son?

26
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,029
你有的好受了
This is gonna hurt.

27
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,013
告诉我发生什么事了?
Ready to tell me what happened?

28
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:20,067
我们正试图找出求救信号的来源
We were trying to find the sourceof the distress call.

29
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,038
我先看到了来自海边的信号灯
I saw the flare from the beach

30
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:26,031
然后看到了Sawyer在丛林中发出的信号
and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle.

31
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,072
我启动天线装置
I switched on my antenna

32
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,031
激活接收机
activated the transceiver...

33
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,085
然后
...and then

34
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,052
眼前一片黑
darkness

35
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,003
有人从后面袭击了我
Whoever hit me came from behind

36
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,053
-还毁坏了设备?  -是的
-They destroyed the equipment?  -Yes.

37
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,083
听着  我们会把事情搞清楚的但不要做任何...
Listen, we're gonna figure this out, but don't do any...

38
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:50,029
为了找出肇事者  该怎么做我就怎么做
I will do what I need to do to find the man responsible.

39
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,004
我们这儿需要帮助!
We need some help over here!

40
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,080
发生什么事了?
What happened?

41
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,031
Sawyer

42
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:41,000
-晨间递送  -你真好  谢谢
-Morning delivery.  -Oh, you're sweet. Thanks.

43
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,096
我想依你现在的状况
Well, I figured in your condition

44
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,071
外加这个大肚子
with the extra baggage, you know

45
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,046
我还可以走 -勉强可以
Well, I can still walk.-Barely.

46
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:54,084
不管怎样我很担心你 你知道这儿太阳很厉害
Anyway, I worry about you out here. You know, it's very...sunny.

47
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,022
我有帽子遮挡
Thus my hat.

48
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:59,060
但你知道山洞那儿的帽子更多
You know, there's plenty of hats in the caves.

49
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,018
而且还有个医生随叫随到
And we got a doctor there as well. That will come in handy.

50
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,094
我喜欢海边 Charlie  -哦
I like the beach, Charlie.  -Yeah.

51
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,044
谁会愿意成天和沙蚤呆在一起?
Who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas?

52
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,049
我愿意呆这儿  直到我们获救
I want to be here. For when we get rescued.

53
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,053
直到我们获救
When we get rescued.

54
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,003
对
Right

55
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,063
Jack  我没事
Jack, it's fine.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,009
擦伤而已
It's just a scrape.

57
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,022
是擦伤  不过是大面积擦伤
Yeah. Lots of scrapes today.

58
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,097
双氧水快没了
I'm running out of peroxide.

59
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,060
-他扑到我身上  -为什么?
-He just jumped me, man. -Why?

60
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,014
Shannon有哮喘病
Shannon has asthma.

61
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,098
-哮喘?  -是的
-Asthma?  -Yeah.

62
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,027
我还没看到她发作过
Never seen her have an attack before.

63
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:49,044
那是因为她有个呼吸器
Because she had an inhaler.

64
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:51,032
没人注意的时候就偷偷的用
She sneaks hits when no one's looking.

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,019
当她还是个孩子的时候就以这为耻
She's just been embarrassed about it since she was a little kid.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,086
我猜用呼吸器呼吸并不舒服
I guess breathing's not cool.

67
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:59,087
有个呼吸器? -几天前用完了
Had an inhaler?-It ran out a couple days ago.

68
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,054
不过还有四个替换药瓶可以够用几个月
But it had four refills, which should have been enough for a couple months.

69
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,066
但她老忘记换药所以我就把它们放在我的箱子内
But she always forgets her medication, so I put it in my suitcase.

70
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,017
今天我看到那个混帐在看"海底沉舟"(小说名)
Today I see that jackass reading "Watership Down"...

71
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,025
你把我弄糊涂了
You're losing me.

72
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,000
那是我包里的东西 我登机前注册过的
It was in my bags...the stuff that I checked.

73
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,030
如果他有我的那本书那他就会有我的行李
If he has my book, he has my luggage.

74
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,026
如果他有我的行李那就一定有呼吸器
If he has the luggage, he has the inhalers.

75
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,052
今天她的呼吸变得真的很困难
Her breathing got really rough today, man.

76
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:27,056
如果哮喘发作事情会很不妙的
If she has an attack, it's not gonna be good.

77
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,057
-它在哪?  -医生  好久不见
-Where is it?  -Hey, doc. Long time, no see.

78
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,015
-它在哪?  -什么在哪?
-Where is it?  -Where's what?

79
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,045
那女孩的哮喘药
The girl's asthma medicine.

80
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:48,024
Shannon她的呼吸器
Shannon. Her inhalers.

81
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,091
那个啊
that.

82
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,000
你打了一个试图帮助妹妹的孩子
You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister.

83
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:55,042
我大喊小偷是因为他在翻我的东西
I whooped a thief 'cause he was going through my stuff.

84
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,046
你的? 怎么会是你的?  -我不得不采取行动
Yours? What makes it yours?  -Which I had to move...

85
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,046
你从人家的提箱内拿走的东西怎么会是你的?
You can just take something out of a suitcase, and that makes it yours?

86
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:05,043
我不知道你们这些山顶洞人有多么奉行共产主义
Look,I don't know want kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town

87
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,080
但这儿所有东西是一九分
but down here possession's 9/10s

88
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,080
人有权保护他的财产
A man's got a right to protect his property.

89
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,076
起来!
Get up!

90
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,073
干吗?  想比谁高?
Why, you wanna see who's taller?

91
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,085
起来!
Get up!

92
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,048
你确定要摊这趟浑水?
You sure you want to make this your problem, doc?

93
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,086
是的  我确定
yeah. I'm sure.

94
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,044
这儿怎么回事?
What's going on here?

95
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:39,092
你说过你要去巴顿党(黑社会组织名)作交易
You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal.

96
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,092
相信我就是了  我没时间解释我已经迟到了
Just trust me. There isn't any time to explain. I'm already late.

97
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,068
如果我错过了这个会议整个交易就泡汤了  明白?
If I miss this meeting, the whole deal's a bust, all right?

98
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:54,085
那是我的全部  140000美元
That's everything I have. $140,000.

99
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,073
墨西哥湾有个油矿开采钻井平台
There's an oil mining operation in the gulf of Mexico. Drilling platforms.

100
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,086
花300000美金就可以参股
$300,000 buys you one share.

101
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,011
但只要你投资了

I found an investor in Toronto. He wants in 50/50.

Two weeks, we'll be splitting almost a million bucks.

107
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:26,009

Jess, this is my chance.

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,072
还有个选择
There's another option.

That I give you the $160,000 and we split the profit.

我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

114
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:51,007
就算那样  我们也拿不到药
That's not gonna help us get the medicine.

115
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,070
或许拿不到但至少感觉很爽
Maybe not, but it'll feel good.

116
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,099
那是什么阻止你这样做?
So what's stopping you?

117

你凭什么认为他会听你的?

我都不知道从哪说起
I wouldn't even know where to start.

128
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,063
用什么可以换呼吸器?
What do you want for the inhalers?

129
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:51,042
问的好  让我想想
Good question. Hang on a tick.

130
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:55,043
我想要什么?
What do I want?

-什么?  -一个吻
-What?  -A kiss.

-买什么?  -这个交易

136
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:16,037
你太过分了Sawyer
You try too hard, Sawyer.

137
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:22,071
我请你去帮个不能呼吸的姑娘而你却要我亲你?
I ask you to help a woman who can't breathe, and you want me to kiss you?

138
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,013
没人比你更恶心了
Nobody's that disgusting.

139
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:32,059
-你要知道我看到过你  -看到我什么?
-I've seen you, you know.  -Seen me what?

140
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:36,097
那张纸你藏口袋里的那张纸
With that piece of paper. The one you keep in your pocket.

141
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:40,018
你念那张纸的时候我看到你的表情了
I've seen the expression on your face when you read it

142
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:44,098
你多么小心翼翼地把它折好那一定对你意味着什么
and how carefully you fold it up. It means something to you.

143
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:48,002
你可以随心所欲的玩游戏
So you can play games all you want

144
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,032
但我知道你内心的某个地方惦记着一个人
but I know there's a human being in there somewhere.

145
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,057
把药给我

你自以为你了解我

是的  我认为我...   -闭嘴!

148
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:03,079
你想知道我是怎样一个人是吧?

"亲爱的Sawyer先生"

153

"你不认识我"
you don't know who I am

154
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,060
"但我认识你"
but I know who you are

155
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:28,077
"而且我知道你做过什么"
and I know what you've done

156
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,044
"你和我妈妈上过床"
You had sex with my mother

157
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,078
"然后你又偷走了我爸爸的钱"
and then you stole my dad's money all away.

158
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,078
"所以他变的很愤怒"
So he got angry

159
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,075
"他杀了我妈妈"
and he killed my mother

160
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,042
然后也杀了他自己"
And then he killed himself, too."

161
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,092
不要停下来
Don't stop now.

162
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,021
后面更精彩
You're getting to the good part.

163
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,063
"我只知道你的名字"
All I know is your name,

164
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,009
"但这几天里我会找到你的"
but one of these days I'm gonna find you,

165
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:04,027
"我会把这封信给你为了让你记着你做过的一切"
and I'm gonna give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me.

166
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:10,019
"你杀了我的父母Sawyer先生"
You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer.

167
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,020
现在亲我一个怎样?
Now how about that kiss?

168
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,009
我看你未必会
I didn't think so.

169
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:56,096
昨天黄昏的时候你在哪?
where were you last night around sunset?

170
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,017
恐怕知道我在哪儿的唯一目击者
Well, I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is

171
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,063
是那只我剥皮用来当晚餐的野猪
the boar that I was skinning for our dinner.

172
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,042
我听说你试图发射求救信号
I heard you were trying to send out a distress call,

173
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:09,034
那就是说
so it would seem

174
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,080
不管是谁攻击你那家伙一定有不想离开这个岛的理由
whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the island.

175
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:19,052
也许是有个人在当前状况下能拿到一定的好处
Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances.

176
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:26,015
还有依我看你和Sawyer先生之间有仇
And from what I've seen, you and mr. Sawyer share a certain animosity.

177
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,094
不会是他  他有不在场的证明
No, he has an alibi.

178
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,090
就在我被攻击之前
Just before I was struck,

179
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:34,078
他还用炮筒发射了一个信号发射的地点在事发地两公里之外
he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we'd worked out 2 kilometers away.

180
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,083
他不可能有时间从...
He couldn't have had the time to go from...

181
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:40,062
除非他找到一个延迟引燃导火线的方法
unless he found a way to time-delay the fuse on his rocket.

182
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,050
他怎么可能有
How could he possibly have

183
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,080
只要看过电视的人都知道如何即时制作一个延时导火线
anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse.

184
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,080
用一根香烟
Use a cigarette.

185
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,056
以后的事  都得以防万一
Just in case there's a next time.

186
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:20,033
试着吸气...吸气
Just try to breathe. Breathe.

把呼吸器给我

Now.

190
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,023

Hell, I wondered when you were gonna stop asking nice.

191
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,095
是时候了  牛仔
Well, it's about time, cowboy.

192
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,083
第一天在野外的时候我就告诉过你
I've been telling you since day one we're in the wild.

193
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,083
看来你一个耳朵进  一个耳朵出
Didn't think you had it in you.

194
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,068
你就只会这些?
That all you got?

195
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,050
我不认为这是一个很好的主意
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.

196
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,058
为什么不?
Why not?

197
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:49,042
因为朋友间做生意总觉得有点困难
Because business between friends is always a little sticky.

198
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,051
我不了解你但我了解你的妻子

以一种自动代理的方式和她合作
Working with her at the auto dealership.

200
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,080
我不知道这样是否合适
I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.

201
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:01,077
Louisiana将投资钻井费用的三分之二
Louisiana will invest two-thirdsof the drilling cost.

202
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,098

听着  David我知道你有点勉为其难

你有个牧场你并不需要这个

00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,050
那个生病的女孩
The sick girl...

295
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,092
-有哮喘  -是的...哮喘
-Yeah, asthma.  -Yes, asthma.

296
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:37,084
我想我能够帮她
I think I can help her.

297
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,052
早上好
Good morning.

298
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,057
你俩干什么?
What are you doing?

299
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,032
Jack!

300
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,082
Sawyer自己找的不是我想惹麻烦
This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.

301
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,078
如果你这样做...
If you do this...

302
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:18,088
你胆子很大么怎么就趁人打盹的时候打劫?!
Well, ain't you the brave one? Jumping a guy while he's napping.

303
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:28,014
看来我真有麻烦了 是吗?
I'm in trouble now, ain't I?

304
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,056
Sawyer

305
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:38,036
我们给你个改过自新的机会
we gave you a chance to do the right thing.

306
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:43,015
我想要的只是哮喘药你只需告诉我呼吸器在哪
Now all I want is the asthma medicine. Just tell me where the inhalers are,

307
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,078
我们就停手
and we'll stop.

308
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,053
停什么? chico(一种灌木这里指Jack)?
Stop what, chico?

309
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:00,080
你本不必承受这种痛苦的
It doesn't have to be this way.

310
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:05,064
是的  确实不必
Yeah, it does.

311
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
伊拉克没有竹子
We do not have bamboo in Iraq.

312
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,032
但有相似的东西...芦苇
Although we do have something similar...reeds.

313
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,095
效果是一样的
But their effect is the same...

314
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,066
当竹尖插入指甲里面
when the chutes are inserted underneath the fingernails.

315
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:33,066
你知道我在想什么吗 Ali(穆罕默德的女婿)
You know what I think, Ali?

316
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,058
我认为你这辈子还没有折磨过人
I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life.

317
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,096
看来我俩都很不辛
Unfortunately for us both

318
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,047
你错了
you're wrong.

319
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,053
就这样?
That's it?

320
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,065
你就这点能耐?
That's all you got?

321
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,086
刺片?
Splinters?

322
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:11,041
毫无疑问我们在哥斯湾痛扁你们
No wonder we kicked your ass in the gulf...aah!

323
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,096
Sayid

324
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:22,004
Sayid!

325
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,039
不要
No.

326
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,097
不要停
Don't stop now.

327
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:34,068
我想我的呼吸很顺畅了
I think my sinuses are clearing.

328
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,077
你这人到底怎么回事?
What the hell is wrong with you?

329
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,019
也许挖出你的眼睛
Perhaps losing an eye

330
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:40,023
能让你打开金口
will loosen your tongue.

331
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:42,077
好吧!
Okay!

332
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:45,032
好
Okay

333
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,016
在哪?
Where is it?

334
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,083
我只告诉
Only person I'll tell...

335
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:56,075
她
is her.

336
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,029
Kate?

337
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:02,088
这是交易
That's the deal.

338
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:10,026
告诉我  Sawyer你想死吗?
Tell me, Sawyer, do you want to die?

339
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:15,052
因为当一个人走进我的房子
Cause when a man walks into my place

340
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:24,007
告诉我他把16万血汗钱交给一个普通市民保管
and tells me he left 160,000 of my hard-won dollars in the care of a civilian...

341
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:27,090
我得问问自己听到的是不是一个请求解脱的
I got to ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't

342
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:30,099
绝望的呼喊
a desperate cry for the sweet release of death.

343
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,016
今天交易达成了
Deal closed today.

344
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:38,000
看女人就是简单
See, women are easy.

345
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:42,058
给些温柔给她们看看新鲜的床上功夫
A few cosmos, a couple of stunts they hadn't seen between the sheets

346
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:44,059
她们会认为整个骗局是她们的点子
and they think the scam's their idea.

347
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,034
还有丈夫们...他们需要触到钱嗅一嗅
Now, the husbands...they need to touch the money, smell it.

348
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,055
认为如果他们有实力吞下别人的钱
Believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase

349
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:55,010
他们就会乖乖的听你话
in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away

350
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,089
然后找机会伪装成个老实的坏蛋
they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.

351
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:04,015
好吧  Tex 如果可以这么轻易的骗到钱
Okay, Tex, if you got your grift so pat,

352
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,028
那你还要我的钱干什么?
what'd you need my money for?

353
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,065
你在上对夫妻中骗到的钱哪去了?
Where's your seed from the last couple you wrote?

354
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:13,003
我该怎么说呢?
Well, what can I say?

355
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:16,041
我喜欢赚的和花的一样多
I like earning it as much as I like spending it.

356
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,025
不过无论如何
Be that as it may

357
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:26,021
我还是知道一两个折磨人的方法
I know a thing or two about making people suffer.

358
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:31,038
现在你拿了我的钱在明天中午之前外加50%的利息一同还我
Now, you have my money, plus 50% by noon tomorrow,

359
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,084
否则我会告诉你该如何折磨人
or I'll tell you all about it.

360
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:01,079
我来了  东西在哪儿?
So I'm here. Where is it?

361
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,004
很乐意告诉你
Happy to tell you

362
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,067
只要你亲我
as soon as I get that kiss.

363
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:12,059
什么?  你是认真的?
What? Are you serious?

364
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:16,001
宝贝儿  这儿是个神秘的丛林我被绑在了树上
Baby, I am tied to a tree in the jungle of mystery.

365
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:21,002
刚刚还被一个他妈的骨科医生和一个真正的伊拉克人折磨过
I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a genuine iraqi.

366
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,006
我当然是认真的
Of course I'm serious.

367
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:28,019
你不会看到刚才的大场面  雀斑女
You're just not seeing the big picture here, freckles.

368
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:30,078
你真想让那女孩窒息而死?!
Are you really gonna let that girl suffocate

369
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:34,007
就因为你无法忍受给我一个"吻"?
cause you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss?

370
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:37,024
妈的  那可是最低要求了
Hell, it's only first base.

371
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:40,003
你还算幸运我并不贪心
Lucky for you, I ain't greedy.

372
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,026
好
Okay.

373
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,069
我没有
I don't have it.

374
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,003
什么?
What?

375
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,041
药
The medicine.

376
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,004
我没那个药  从来就没有过
I don't have it. I never did.

377
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,050
那本书
The book...

378
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,046
他们说你在他们的行李中找到的
they said you found it in their luggage.

379
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,033
书  连同其他的一切
Book washed up on shore.

380
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:15,000
都被冲到了岸边
It went in the drink with the rest of...

381
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,031
他并没有药
He doesn't have it.

382
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:34,002
-什么?  -他在说谎  难道看不出来?
-What?  -He's lying. Can't you see that?

383
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:35,069
他从一开始就在撒谎
He's been lying from the beginning.

384
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:37,099
他不想让我们离开这个岛
He doesn't want us to get off this island.

385
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:39,095
-那就是他袭击我的原因  -等等  伙计
-That's why he attacked me.  -Hold on a minute, man.

386
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:43,016
-他损坏了接收机  -你并不知道
-He destroyed the transceiver.  -You don't know that.

387
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,012
Sayid!

388
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:10,043
他切中动脉了
He hit an artery.

389
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,085
不要动!  该死...
Keep still, damn it.

390
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:19,003
Sayid 山洞里有我要的东西就在我的皮背包里  快去!
Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves. My leather backpack. Go!

391
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:23,074
能止住血吗?
Can you make it stop?

392
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,064
这是谁的血?
Whose blood is that?

393
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,093
谁的血?
Whose blood is that?

394
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:50,018
Sawyer

395
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,073
你去追Sawyer却不告诉我一声?
You went after Sawyer, and you didn't even tell me?

396
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,069
-她是我妹妹  -Boone
-She's my sister.  -Boone.

397
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:59,048
不要留我一个人在这儿好吗?
Don't leave me alone, okay?

398
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,058
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

399
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,066
好吗?
Okay?

400
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,000
好
Okay.

401
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,088
是这些吗?我想树是找对了,但...
Are these the right ones? I think I found the right tree, but...

402
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:30,060
哦是的太好了
Oh, yes. Good.

403
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:00,092
不要...老兄
Don't, man.

404
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,076
我告诉你
I'm telling you...

405
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,001
不要那样
Don't.

406
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:20,019
别管我
Let go.

407
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,098
我知道你根本不想关心我
I know you want to.

408
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:23,053
闭嘴  不要动
Shut up, and stop moving.

409
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,019
你一直在等这个机会是不是?
You've been waiting for this, haven't you?

410
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,090
现在你又成英雄了
Now you get to be a hero again,

411
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:30,053
因为你就是这么做的你总会把事情伪装得很完美
cause that's what you do. You fix everything up all nice.

412
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:36,071
是时候松开了  雀斑女我们已经亲热过了
Time to let go, freckles. We already made out.

413
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:39,033
我还有什么好奢求的?
What else I got to live for?

414
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,080
Jack你得记住
Hey, Jack, there's something you should know.

415
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:47,063
如果我们现在处境交换的话
If the tables were turned...

416
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,001
我会看着你死
I'd watch you die.

417
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:57,035
很好
All righty.

418
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,031
看来我们在石油生意上达成一致了
Looks like we're in the oil business.

419
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,048
就这样行了?  -哦行了
We're cool?  -Oh, we're cool.

420
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:07,082
我们把钱取回来  -明天之后的一个礼拜增值三倍
We get the money back...  -A week from tomorrow. Tripled.

421
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,078
你不会逃之夭夭吧  会吗?
You're not gonna skip town, are you?

422
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,066
David看老天的份上!
David, for god's sake!

423
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:14,099
他的钱都在我们这儿要逃的也该是我们
He left all his money with us. We could have skipped town.

424
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,046
你有个聪明的女人 David  不要让她给跑了
Smart woman you got there, David. Don't let her go.

425
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,042
宝贝儿
Hi, baby.

426
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,046
怎么起来了?  感觉好点了吗?
What are you doing up? Are you feeling better?

427
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,088
念故事给我听好吗?
Will you read to me?

428
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,084
马上就来  宝贝 我们现在有客人
In a minute, sweetheart. We have company right now.

429
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:42,027
你没事吧?
You okay?

430
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,065
交易取消
Deal's off.

431
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:47,078
你说什么? -交易取消  就此结束
Excuse me?-Deal's off. Forget it.

432
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,082
你这是干什么?  -等等这算什么玩笑?
What are you doing?  -Hold on. What is this, a joke?

433
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,020
取消了就是取消了 我得走了
I'm calling it off, walking away.

434
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,024
不许走
You're not walking out of here.

435
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,091
你知道我为了这个付出多少要我一天之内取到这么多钱?
You know what I had to do for this, all this money in one day?

436
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,037
把手拿开小子-Sawyer!-这到底怎么回事?
Take your hand off me, boy.-Sawyer!-What's going on here?

437
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,041
结果不应该是这样的
This is isn't how it wassupposed to work.

438
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,063
你说过我们...  -他说什么了 Jessica?!
You said that we were... -What did he say, Jessica?!

439
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,016
活着算你走运
You're lucky to be alive.

440
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,087
回洞里检查Shannon去了
Went to the caves to check on Shannon.

441
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,080
我又读了一遍
I read it again.

442
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,026
又一遍
And then again,

443
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:53,009
因为我想搞明白你为什么打Boone
because I've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone

444
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:56,009
而不直接告诉他 你没有他妹妹的药物
instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication.

445
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,043
但你又为什么要假装有呢!
Why you pretended to have it anyway.

446
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:04,014
我唯一想得到的解释是 你想要大家都恨你
The thing that I keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated.

447
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:07,065
然后我看了看信封
Then I looked at the envelope.

448
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,069
"美国两百周年纪念诺克斯维尔田纳西州"
"America's bicentennial. Knoxville, Tennessee."

449
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:17,057
那时你还是个孩子8岁或许9岁
You were just a kid. 8, maybe 9 years old.

450
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:22,041
这封信不是写给你的是你自己写的
This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter.

451
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:29,034
你名字不叫Sawyer是吧?
Your name's not Sawyer, is it?

452
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,051
那是他的名字
It was his name.

453
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,014
他是个自信的男人
He was a confidence man.

454
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:41,052
和我妈妈搞关系又拿到了钱
Romanced my mama to get to the money.

455
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:46,090
然后擦擦屁股走人  留下一堆屎
Wiped them out clean, left a mess behind.

456
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,015
所以我写了那封信
So I wrote that letter.

457
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,065
我写了信  以为我会找到他的
I wrote it knowing one day I'd find him.

458
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:58,062
这还不算是最悲哀的部分
But that ain't the sad part.

459
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:01,041
我19岁的时候
When I was 19,

460
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,000
需要6000美金来还给那些和我有关系的家伙
I needed 6 grand to pay these guys off I was in trouble with.

461
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,055
所以我找了个漂亮的女人 她老公是个聋子很有钱
So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money.

462
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,035
我成功的让他把钱给了我
And I got him to give it to me.

463
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,014
那是怎样的一种悲哀?
And I got him to give it to me.

464
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:29,015
我变成了我苦苦追寻的那个人
I became the man I was hunting.

465
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:32,069
我变成了Sawyer
I became Sawyer.

466
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:45,062
不用同情我
Don't you feel sorry for me.

467
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,059
离开这儿
Get the hell out.

468
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,071
滚开
Get out!

469
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:32,067
我不知道  感觉这就像个奇迹
I don't know. It's like some miracle.

470
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:34,022
她就弄了些混合物
She just showed upwith that mixture.

471
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:37,009
擦在Shannon的胸部10分钟后她居然能呼吸了
She rubbed it on Shannon's chest, and 10 minutes later she was breathing.

472
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,066
桉树
Eucalyptus.

473
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,025
聪明  Jack
Smart, Jack.

474
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,021
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

475
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:22,028
-你在干什么?  -打点你的东西
-What are you doing?  -Packing your stuff.

476
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:24,011
你要搬到洞里去了
You're moving to the caves.

477
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,049
你不会吧?
You didn't?

478
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,065
花生黄油?
Peanut butter?

479
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,003
不可能吧!  -你预定的呀
No way!  -Just like you ordered.

480
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:36,004
不过有件事
Oh. There is one thing.

481
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:40,008
那东西特别的油滑
It's extra smooth.

482
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,025
没关系
That's okay.

483
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,064
是空的
It's empty.

484
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:57,002
不
No.

485
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,031
不不  是满的
No, it's not. It's full.

486
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:03,065
都满到瓶口了
Full to the brim with...

487
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,057
粘到你嘴的上颚去了
stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth,

488
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,040
老天  它让我想喝杯牛奶
oh, God, it makes you want a glass of milk,

489
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:11,045
特别的油滑
extra smooth...

490
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:24,008
这是我尝过的最美味的花生黄油
it's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted.

491
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:30,005
要来点吗?
You want some?

492
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:47,048
Sayid

493
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:57,003
-我不能再呆下去了  -什么?
-I can't stay here.  -What?

494
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,099
我要离开我也不知道要多久
I'm leaving. I don't know for how long.

495
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:00,029
Sayid你不能这样
Sayid, you can't.

496
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,008
我们还不知道那是什么东西
We still don't know what's out there.

497
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:06,071
比起丛林怪物有些东西更让我感到可怕
I have worse things to fear than what's in the jungle.

498
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,096
我今天做的事...
What I did today...

499
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,047
我今天差点就做的事
what I almost did...

500
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,005
我发誓我再不会这么做了
I swore to do never again.

501
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,056
如果我不能遵守诺言

502
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:20,081
我没权力呆在这儿
I have no right to be here.

503
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:24,023
我没地方可去
There's no where to go.

504
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:26,090
但必须得有人走遍这个海岸画好这座岛屿的地图
Someone has to walk the shore and map the island,

505
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:29,002
去看看还有什么东西在这儿
see what else there is.

506
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,082
我找不到一个更适合做这件事的人 我只相信我自己
I can't think of a better person to do it than the only one I trust.

507

希望还能再次和你相遇
