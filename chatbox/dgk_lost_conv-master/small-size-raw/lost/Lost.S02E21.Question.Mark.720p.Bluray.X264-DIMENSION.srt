Malkin女士  我们失陪一下
Mrs. Malkin, would you excuse us for a moment?

156
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,025
好的
Of course.

157
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:57,025
阁下  恕我直言
Monsignor, with all due respect

158
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:59,019
我不能答应你让我做的事
I cannot do what you have asked.

159
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,069
为什么?
Why not?

160
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,059
因为我不相信这个女人说的
Because I do not believe what this woman says.

161
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:10,055
你觉得我为什么让你去?
Why do you think I chose you?

162
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:26,019
你是不是发现什么我不知道的了?
Are you seeing something I'm not?

163
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:31,085
我什么痕迹都没发现
I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign

164
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:35,002
从我们离开舱口就什么都没发现过
since we left the hatch.

165
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,002
你到底在跟踪什么?
What the hell are you following?

166
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,002
问号在哪?
Where is the question mark?

167
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:43,058
什么?
what?

168
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:49,081
问号  John  它在哪?
The question mark, John. Where is it?

169
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:52,005
你知道吗?
You know what?

170
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,029
你一直在异想天开
You keep chasing after your own shadow.

171
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,000
我要回去了
I'm going back.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,092
我知道你不愿意给我看 但是你必须得这么做
I know you do not want to show me, but you must.

173
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,089
不  我没有义务让你知道任何事
No, I don't have to show you anything.

174
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,095
那对不起了
Then I'm sorry.

175
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:30,028
你打了我
You hit me.

176
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,088
你为什么...
Why did you?

177
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:36,027
因为你不太合作
Because you were being difficult.

178
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:38,002
你疯了么?
Are you insane?

179
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:43,005
没有
No.

180
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:48,012
Ana Lucia 你的朋友
Ana Lucia, your friend

181
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:50,028
刚被杀  而你...
was just murdered and you...

182
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,048
Ana要我来帮助你  John
Ana wants me to help you, John.

183
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:55,072
帮我什么?
Help me do what?

184
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:59,054
找到问号
Find the question mark.

185
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,005
你根本不明白自己在说些什么 是吧
You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?

186
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:08,024
不
No.

187
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:11,018
但是你知道我在说什么  John
But you know what I am talking about, John

188
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,065
那才是关键
and that is all that matters.

189
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,015
给你
Here.

190
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:18,092
给你  你不是想找到问号么?
Here. You wanna find your damn question mark?

191
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:20,088
就这个  在这  就在这里
Here, this is it right here.

192
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:23,035
给你  拿着吧  这根本什么都不是
Here, take it. Because it's nothing.

193
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,025
凭记忆随便画的  只出现了十秒钟
It's a memory. It's ten seconds of nothing

194
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,058
这是你的舱子  对吧?
This is your hatch, yes?

195
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:32,067
这不是我的舱子
It's not my hatch.

196
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:35,068
如果这个天鹅是我们来的地方
If the swan is where we came from

197
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:37,068
那么我们就往这走
then we go that way.

198
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,072
我们根本就不该来这的
We shouldn't even be out here.

199
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:46,038
如果我告诉Jack,Henry曾经攻击过Ana Lucia 她也许就不会死了
Ana Lucia would still be alive, if I'd just told Jack that Henry attacked her.

200
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,032
现在她想让我们到这儿来
Now she wants us to go here

201
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:52,022
她想让我们去这 John 我们一起
She wants us to go here, John. Together.

202
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:55,035
她在我的梦里告诉我的
She said this in my dream.

203
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,035
噢 对了 在你的梦里
Oh, of course, your dream.

204
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,062
告诉我  John
Tell me, John

205
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:05,065
你是否曾经跟随你梦的指引?
haven't you ever followed a dream?

206
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:11,038
那么 罗马教廷会对这很感兴趣 是吗
So, the Vatican's really interested in this one

207
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:14,032
那要看我怎么写我的报告了
That depends upon what I put in my report.

208
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,032
那么你就从
Why don't you just start by telling me

209
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:18,085

我大概在夜里1点接到个电话

Ambrose把这个女孩的尸体送来

她呆在水里已经两个钟头了

你对像这样溺水身亡的事件有经验吗?

214
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:33,021
是的  当然  我从未失误过

你是什么时候发现她没死?

219
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:50,002
在解剖验尸的时候
During the autopsy.

220
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,055
在解剖验尸的时候?
During the autopsy?

221
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:54,012
没关系
It's all right.

222
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:59,012
我没指望你相信我
I didn't expect you to believe me.

223
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:03,082
我想你个能想要亲自听听
I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.

224
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,060
死者为白人女性

拿走吧
Take it.

233
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,078
拜托...
No, please.

234
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:42,022
我再也不想听了
I don't want to ever listen to that tape again.

235
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:54,002
迷路了?
You lost already?

236
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,008
你的地图不准
Your map is inexact.

237
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:57,055
你没在开玩笑?
No kidding?

238
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,005
这些地理标志...
These landmarks...

239
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,090
是条河吗?
Is this a river?

240
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,090
不  只是条曲线
No, it's a wavy line.

241
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,020
这不是我画的  是我抄来的
I didn't draw it. I just transcribed it.

242
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,090
我告诉你了  我不知道这是不是地图
I told you I don't even know if it is a map.

243
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,095
假设它是的
Let's assume it is.

244
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,045
那个斧头用来干吗?
What's the ax for?

00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:15,045
我现在还不知道
I don't know yet.

飞机是你发现的么?
You were the one that found this plane, yes?

247
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:48,082
是的

当时它在上面
It was up there.

00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:58,072
怎么掉下来的?
And what made it fall?

250
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:01,012
Boone

251
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:04,012

什么?
Excuse me?

255

我们露营...
We make camp

休息一下...

259
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:30,058
等待下一步的指示
and wait for further instruction.

260
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,098
他们到底去哪了?
Where in the hell are they?

00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,015
冷静点
Just calm down.

262
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:38,012
在黑夜里追踪不是那么简单的
Finding his trail in the dark is not gonna be easy.

263
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:42,024
他们马上会回来的

264
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:43,078
Jack

265
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:48,037

00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:56,085

No.

270
00:17:56,085 --> 00:18:01,034
不好
It's not good.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,035
你就没有...
And there's nothing you can?

272
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:06,068
我能让她更好过点
I can make her comfortable.

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,042
但我没有我需要的
But I don't have what I need.

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,042
你看着我干吗?
Why look at me?

00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,060
我两天前就把该死的药都给你了
I gave you all the meds two days ago.

276

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,002
Kate一起去
Kate is going with you.

281
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:37,090
你在说什么? 干吗要我跟他一起去?
What are you talking about? Why would he need me to go with him?

282
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,015
Jack知道我的海洛因和枪是放在一起的
Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns.

284
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:48,084
要么就让可怜的Libby痛苦下去
or let poor Libby suffer.

285
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,085
是不是这样  医生?
That pretty much it, Doc?

286
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:55,095
是的  差不多是这样
Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

287
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:03,065
我们走吧 雀斑女
Let's go, Freckles

288

I'm curious about something.

289
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:24,085

00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:29,095
Ana  Lucia怎么拿到你的枪的?
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?

291
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:33,015
我不知道  肯定是偷的
I don't know. She must have lifted it off me.

292
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:35,058
她偷了你的枪?
She pickpocketed your gun?

293
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,015
她怎么做到的?
How'd she do that?

294
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,028
我要是知道的话
if I knew how she did it

295
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:45,028
她就没机会下手了  不是吗?
she wouldn't be able to do it, would she?

296
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:47,065
你先请
After you.

297
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:50,065
我以为你是带我去你藏东西的地方
I thought you were taking me to your stash.

298
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,072
别把每件事都想这么复杂?
Do you have to make everything so damn difficult?

299
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:58,042
进去就好了
Just go in.

300
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:17,012
你把枪都藏这了
You kept the guns here.

你一直把它们藏在自己底下
All this time, right under you.

00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:26,015
骗到你们了吧?
Fooled you, didn't I?

303

00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:56,082
Yemi

312
00:21:56,082 --> 00:22:01,078
醒醒  John
Wake up, John.

313
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,087
你还好吧  John?
Are you all right, John?

314
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:11,078
很好
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:13,028
我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

316
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:17,088
你做梦了
You had a dream?

317
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:23,098
有没有梦到一个男的? 一个牧师?
Was there a man? A priest?

318
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:29,057
你梦到的那个人是我的弟弟
The man that you saw was my brother.

319
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:31,025
你弟弟
Your brother?

320
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:33,078
这就是我们要一起来的原因
This is why we needed to come together.

321
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,025
我们会以这种方式得到指示
This is how we are going to be led

322
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:39,092
-也会通过这种方式知道下一步怎么走  -可我不知道往哪儿走啊
-how we will know where to go next.  -I don't know where to go.

323
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,018
-他有没有告诉你什么? -不  他...
-Did he tell you anything? -No. He...

324
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,082
没有?  什么事都可以?
Nothing? Anything?

325
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:46,035
梦里的不是我  是你
It wasn't even me. It was you.

326
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,032
那个  那个  没有...
It didn't...

327
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,002
他...
He...

328
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,095
他要我跟着他
he wanted me to follow him.

329
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:58,032
去哪?
Follow him where?

330
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,071
等在这
Wait here.

331
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:12,048
Eko  那只是个梦
Eko, it was just a dream.

332
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:17,055
那很不安全
It's not safe.

333
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:22,002
Eko
Eko!

334
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,088
神父  恐怕现在不方便说话
Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time.

335
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,018
你得改日再来
You'll have to come back later.

336
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,095
Malkin女士  我必须和你女儿谈谈
Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter.

337
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:42,045
-昨天在教堂  你说...  -我知道我说了什么
-Yesterday in the church you said...  -I know what I said.

338
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:46,038
现在真的不方便说话
It's just right this minute it's not a very good time.

339
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,038
回房子里去  Joyce
All right. Get back in the house, Joyce.

340
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,002
-把她带进去. -Richard  别这样...
-Get her inside. -Richard, please...

341
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:54,065
马上进去
Inside. Now.

342
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,002
我知道你来干嘛的  朋友
I know why you're here, friend

343
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,055
不过你大可不必费神
but you can save yourself the trouble.

344
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,060
这里没有发生什么奇迹
What happened here was not a miracle.

345
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,050
给您女儿治疗的医生可不这么认为
The doctor that treated your daughter seems to feel differently.

346
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,032
治疗?
Treated her?

347
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,032
你是说准备把她开膛破肚的家伙
You mean tried to cut her open.

348
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:15,040
他只是想掩饰自己的疏忽
He's just trying to cover up his own negligence.

349
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,020
他告诉你整个经过了吗?  她是如何"淹死"的
He tell you the whole story --how she supposedly drowned?

350
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,042
她掉进了山里的河中
She fell into a mountain river.

351
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,060
她的身体机能停滞了
Her body shut down.

352
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,005
体温降低使她呈现假死状态
She went into hypothermia, which made her appear dead.

353
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,078
那您的妻子为什么深信这是个奇迹呢?
Then why is your wife so convinced otherwise?

354
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:29,092
因为她是个狂热的教徒
Cause she's a zealot.

355
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,060
她做的这一切
All of this, everything she's doing

356
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,055
都是为了给我造成困扰
it's to spite me.

357
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,002
她为什么要这样做?
Why would she spite you?

358
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,042
因为她知道我是个骗子
Because she knows I'm a fraud.

359
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:42,045
因为我的职业是通灵者
Because I make my living as a psychic.

360
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,015
我就是靠这个谋生的
You see, that's what I do.

361
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,028
我收集人们的智慧
I gather intelligence on people

362
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,050
把这些作为己用
and I exploit it.

363
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,025
每天
Every day

364
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:52,008
我去见那些寻找奇迹的人
I meet people looking for a miracle

365
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,015
但是根本就找不到
desperate to find one.

366
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:58,044
因为根本没有奇迹可言
But there are none to be had.

367
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:01,078
至少在这个世界上是没有的
Not in this world, anyway.

368
00:25:03,078 --> 00:25:05,052
我会回去禀告阁下
I will report back to my monsignor

369
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:08,068
这里没有发生奇迹
that there was no miracle here.

370
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:15,005
您的女儿活着 这个是最重要的
Your daughter is alive. This is all that matters.

371
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:50,005
小心
Be careful.

372
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:57,092
Eko

373
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,045
Eko

374
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:10,005
我没事
I'm fine.

375
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,005
嘿  Eko
Hey, Eko.

376
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:34,040
上面有什么? 你看到什么了吗?
What's up there? Do you see anything?

377
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,008
不是什么也没有...
I don't see nothing.

378
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,013
这里被撒过盐
It's salted.

379
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:08,010
什么?
What?

380
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,013
土  掺进了盐所以上面什么也不长
The earth. It's been salted so that nothing can grow.

381
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,013
谁会在这儿撒盐...
Why would anyone wanna salt it?

382
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,043
什么都没有
There's nothing here.

383
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:18,017
我想他们做了一个圆圈的记号
I believe they made a circle, a target,

384
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:21,033
做了一个目标 这样从上面就可以看到这个地方
so that this place can be seen from up above.

385
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,090
他们?
They?

386
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,017
什么地方?
What place?

387
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:29,040
这架飞机掉下来的地方 John  来吧
The place that this plane fell upon, John. Come on.

388
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:52,027
John

389
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:58,087
能帮我一把吗?
Will you help me with this?

390
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:25,083
等等
Wait.

391
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,020
Eko
Eko

392
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,080
我来好么?
May I?

393
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,077
好的  请便
Please. Be my guest.

394
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:50,086
我们本来要开始第一次约会的
We were gonna have our first date.

395
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,050
约会?
Date?

396
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:03,047

很高兴你没事  伙计

398
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,053
John
John.

399
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,040
你好  我是Mark Wickmund博士
Hello. I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,

400
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,073
这是入门指导影片
and this is the orientation film

401
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:41,070
专为达摩启动计划的第五站所做
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.

402
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,020
第五站  又名珍珠  是一个监视站
Station 5, or The Pearl, is a monitoring station

403
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,050
达摩启动计划中 所有的参与者的一切行动

404
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,037
都将在此被观察与记录
can be observed and recorded

405
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,040
这不仅为后人留下研究资料
not only for posterity,

406
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,077
同时也为了计划的整体进行
but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole.

407
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,057
正如Karen Degroot自己所写
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,

408
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,060
细致的观察
Careful observation

409
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,057
是得到完整真知的唯一途径
is the only key to true and complete awareness.

410
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:08,050
你们在珍珠监察站内的任务为期三周
Your tour of duty in The Pearl will last three weeks

411
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,053
在此期间  你和你的同伴
and during this time you and your partner

412
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:13,080
会观测到一个正在进行的心理学实验

415
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,037
这些成员
These team members

416
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,060
并不知晓其身处被监视状态
are not aware they are under surveillance

417
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,070
也不知道其身为实验对象
or that they are subjects of an experiment.

418
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,000
你和你的同伴将按八小时制轮流值班
Working in eight-hour shifts,

419
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,057
记录下所观测到的所有情况

420
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:32,080
并在我们提供的笔记本上记录下来
in the notebooks we've provided.

421
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,043
这一实验的目的何在? 你们可能对此产生疑问
What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask?

422
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:39,063
这些实验对象努力完成每项任务
What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing

423
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:42,033
是为了达成什么目的?
as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?

424
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,050
作为观测者的你们无需了解
You, as the observer, don't need to know.

425
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:45,083
你们只需记住

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,090
不管多么小或看起来多么不重要
no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant

430
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,093
都要记录
must be recorded.

431
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:00,017
一旦一本笔记本记满了
Each time a notebook is filled

432
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:05,079
你们辛勤观测的结果
with the fruits of your diligent observation,

433
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,097
卷起来 把它放进准备好的容器里
roll it up, and place it in one of the containers provided.

434
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:10,023
然后只需把该容器
Then simply place the container

435
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:12,033
放进气动导管里
in the pneumatic tube

436
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:16,020
然后...嗖的一下
and presto,

437
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,060
我们就能拿到你们的报告了
it will be transported directly to us.

438
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,030
每次八小时轮岗时间到了之后
At the end of your eight-hour shift,

439
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,050

重要?
Important?

等一下
I'm sorry.

454
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:26,062
你刚才不是跟我一起看了那段影片吗?
Weren't you just watching the same thing I was?

00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:28,082
是的  John
Yes, John

那是
That's

462
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,065
一个笑话
a joke.

463
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:50,045
竹篮打水
Rats in a maze

464
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,022
一场空
with no cheese.

465
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,022
那是工作  John
It is work, John.

466
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:56,022
我们在被考验
We are being tested.

467
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:58,098
考验?
Tested?

468
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:02,048
按那个按键的原因...
The reason to do it, push the button,

469
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:05,068
不是因为在影片里他叫我们这么做
is not because we are told to do so in a film.

470
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:08,018
好吧
Oh, well.

471
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,025
那么原因是什么呢...
Well, then, what is the reason

472
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,005
Eko先生?
Mr. Eko?

473
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:16,098
我们做是因为我们相信自己注定要做
We do it because we believe we are meant to.

474
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:22,075
你不也是因为这才按按键的吗  John?
Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?

475
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:26,028
我从来没有...
I was never

476
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:27,085
注定...
meant to

477
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:32,067
要去做任何事
do anything!

478
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:37,020
我那可悲的卑贱的生命里的每一秒钟
Every single second of my pathetic little life

479
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,058
都跟那个按键一样毫无意义
is as useless as that button!

480
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:45,088
你认为这很重要? 你认为这有必要?
You think it's important? You think it's necessary?

481
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,088
这些什么都不是  什么都不是
It's nothing. It's nothing.

482
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:51,055
这些毫无意义
It's meaningless.

483
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:57,054
你又凭什么告诉我这些?
And who are you to tell me that it's not?

484
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,095
这是815号航班  从23号门登机
That's flight 815 leaving from gate 23.

485
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:06,008
谢谢
Thank you.

486
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:13,015
你来这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

487
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,075
我要见你
I had to see you.

488
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:16,098
-听着  我父亲叫我别来... -我知道
-Look, your father said... -I know.

489
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:18,082
他不想让我和你说话
He doesn't want me talking to you

490
00:38:18,082 --> 00:38:20,078
我知道你或许觉得我疯了
nd I know you probably think I'm crazy,

491
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:23,068
可我答应要给你带个口信
but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.

492
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:28,032
口信?
A message?

493
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:30,078
他说你是个好神父
He says you were a good priest.

494
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:32,062
谁说的?
Who says that?

495
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:37,038
Yemi
Yemi

496
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:41,012
别拿我弟弟的名字...
Speaking about my brother

497
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:42,098
开玩笑
is not a joke,

498
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:45,068
当心你说的话
so you should be very careful what you say next.

499
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:49,012
当我在  另一个空间徘徊时 我见到了他
I saw him when I was between places.

500
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,062
他说你会来看我
He said that you would come and see me.

501
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,062
他说尽管你极力伪装
He said even though you were pretending,

502
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,012
你仍是个好人
you're a good man.

503
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:57,052
这是谁叫你说的?
Who put you up to this?

504
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,015
是你父亲吗?
Did your father tell you to do this?

505
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:01,002
他要我告诉你你们很快会见面的
He wants you to know he will see you soon.

506
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:04,005
他说尽管你对自己没信心
He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself

507
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,055
他对你却很有信心
he has faith in you.

508
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:08,045
你干吗这样对我?
Why are you doing this to me?

509
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,048
你想要什么? 你为什么这样做?
What do you want? Why are you doing this to me?

510
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,052
你们...
Is everything...

511
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:18,012
没事吧?
all right?

512
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,068
他相信你
He has faith in you.

513
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:29,008
总有一天  你会相信我的
One day you'll believe me.

514
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:36,068
这个十字架是我弟弟Yemi的
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.

515
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:39,072
Yemi是个了不起的人
Yemi was a great man,

516
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:41,045
一个牧师
a priest

517
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,055
上帝的仆人
a man of God,

518
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:48,051
因为我背叛了他  他被枪杀了
and because I betrayed him, he was shot and died.

519
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,052
他被放在一架飞机上
He was placed on a plane

520
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:54,012
从尼日利亚的跑道起飞
which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria,

521
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:59,012
远在地球的另一边
half a world from here.

522
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:02,058
然后  我坐的飞机
Then the plane that I was on

523
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:05,038
在这个岛上坠毁了
crashed on this island.

524
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:07,075
不知何故  就在这儿
And somehow, here,

525
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:09,095
我又找到了我的弟弟
I found my brother again.

526
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:13,055
我在那架从尼日利亚起飞的飞机上发现了他
I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria,

527
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:16,025
就是现在我们上面的那架
in the same plane that lies above us now

528
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:20,065
掩盖住这个地方的飞机
that has concealed this place.

529
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:24,038
我从Yemi脖子上取下这个十字架
And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck

530
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:28,032
戴在自己脖子上
and put it back on mine.

531
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:29,095
就像
Just as it was

532
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:36,052
我第一次杀人的那天一样
on the day I first took another man's life.

533
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:44,008
所以我来问问你
So let me ask you,

534
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:50,085
你怎么能说这是没有意义呢?
how can you say this is meaningless?

535
00:40:52,008 --> 00:40:54,035
我相信在那个舱子里的工作
I believe the work being done in the hatch

536
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:59,092
比什么都重要
is more important than anything.

537
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:05,028
如果你不继续按按键的话  John
If you will not continue to push the button, John...

538
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:10,028
我来按
I will.

539
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:44,018
我...
Can...

540
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:47,077
我能和她说说话么?
Can I talk to her?

541
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:52,078
当然
Sure.

542
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,045
是我  Hurley
It's Hurley.

543
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:24,092
Hugo
Hugo.

544
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:38,095
我很抱歉我忘了拿毯子
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.

545
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:45,025
我很抱歉我忘了拿毯子
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.

546
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:54,098
Libby?

547
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,048
Michael...

548
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,098
Michael...他很好
Michael. He's OK.

549
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:12,098
他挺过来了  Libby  没事了
He made it, Libby. It's OK.

550
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:17,068
没事了
It's all right.
