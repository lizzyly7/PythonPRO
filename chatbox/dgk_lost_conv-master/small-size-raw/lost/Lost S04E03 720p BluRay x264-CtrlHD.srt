要想活命就跟我来
If you want to live,you need to come with me.

-Daniel Faraday  我是来救你们的  -就这些人吗?
Daniel faraday. I'm here to rescue you. so this is the team?

9
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,059
他们不合适参加这种任务
These are the wrong people for a mission like this.

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,013
无实战经验  没受过军事训练
None of them have field experience,military training.

11
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,024
不能置他们于危险而不顾
You can't just drop them in unprotected.

00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:40,003
我尽力而为吧
There's only so much I can do.

直升机坠毁在哪?
Where's the chopper? where did it crash?

坠毁?  你当我菜鸟啊?

起来  跟我们走

我们得留在这儿  这样他们才找得到我们

你错了  我们不想被别人发现
See,there's your problem. we don't want to be found.

你想知道我为何到这来吗?
You wanted to know why we're here?

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,090
直说了吧  我们是来找Benjamin Linus的
I'll tell you why we're here. we're here for benjamin linus.

21
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:01,007
他现在在哪儿?
Now where is he?

22
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:23,008
Ben之前有提到
Did ben ever mention anything

23

25
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,055
听着  事情很简单
Look,this is real simple.

00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,062
你知不知道他在哪儿?
Do you know where he is or don't you?

27
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,049
-你找他干嘛?  -我想知道他的位置
What do you want with him? I wanna locate him.

28
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,086
我的雇主只告诉我他叫Benjamin Linus
The people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus.

29
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:36,083
和一张照片  只告诉我这么多
They gave this picture,and that's all they told me.

30
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,056
只吩咐叫我找到他  然后拿钱
They said,"find him." and for what they're paying me,

31
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,023
其它我都不关心
I don't need to know anything else.

32
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,079
你知道么?
Do you?

33
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,016
你找Ben?
You want ben?

34
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,066
好吧  他和你的朋友还有Locke在一起
Okay,he's with locke and your friend...

35
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,023
-Charlotte  -Charlotte
Charlotte. charlotte.

36
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,099
Locke也抓住了她  我们知道他往哪去
Locke's got her,too,and we know where he's heading.

37
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,039
Locke是杀了Naomi的那厮吗?
Locke's the guy that killed naomi?

38
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,083
Shephard把枪还给我
Give me back my gun,shephard.

39
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:01,073
想要枪  先回答我的问题
You want your gun back. I want answers.

40
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,073
-你不相信我  -我不相信你
You don't trust me. I don't trust you.

41
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:06,073
其实你早该死翘翘了
In fact,you're supposed to be dead.

42
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,083
我之前问过什么了吗?  没有
But am I asking a billion questions? no.

43
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,077
我们都要面对Locke这个大麻烦
We both have the same problem-- this locke guy.

44
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,021
就算Locke抓了你的同伴
Even if locke has your friend,

45
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,018
你也不能大摇大摆地去带人走
You can't just waltz in there and grab her.

46
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,031
他们有武装的
They're armed.

47
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:18,027
那又怎样?  我们不也一样吗
Well,how about that? so are we.

48
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,027
我们快行动吧
So why don't we move out and--

49
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:22,043
你哪儿也别去  直升机还能飞吗? 
You're not going anywhere. will that helicopter fly?

50
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,073
可以
What she does.

51
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,043
-那就带我去你船上  -Sayid  等等
Then you can take me to your ship. sayid,wait a second.

52
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:32,033
我们说过让他们带我们走  不是吗? 
We did call these people to get us off this island, Didn't we?

53
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,080
怎样?
Well?

54
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,083
来的时候耗油太多了
I burned a lot of fuel coming in.

55
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,045
不能载太多重量
I can't carry much weight.

56
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,078
我带你们三人走
I'll take three of ya.

57
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:42,025
你这山羊胡子白日发昏吧?!
In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee,

58
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,022
别忘了这些乡巴佬还抓了Charlotte呢
One of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner.

59
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:46,039
我能把她安全救出来  
I can bring her back safely.

60
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,095
要是我做到了...
And if I do...

61
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,078
你会带我上船吗?
Will you take me to the ship?

62
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,015
肯定会
Absolutely.

63
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,041
你把Charlotte安然无恙带回来
You bring charlotte back safe,

64
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,095
我就带你们离开这座小岛
And I will take you off this island.

65
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,091
早上好
Good morning.

66
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,018
早上好

67
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,018
距下一个洞还远呢
It's a long walk to the next hole.

68
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,085
要我搭你一程吗?
Do you need a ride?

69
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,031
谢谢  不必了  我的球就在这儿呢
Thank you,but no. my ball is right here.

70
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:40,018
知道吗,你是我见过第一个在这儿晃悠一早上的人
You know, You're the first person I've seen out here all morning.

71
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,018
我想大家为了彼此的私人空间
I believe we're paying quite a premium

72
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,068
都花了不少
For that kind of privacy.

73
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:46,018
确实是这样
Indeed we are.

74
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,038
第一次来Seychelles吗?
Is this your first time in the seychelles?

75
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,071
是我就用5号杆
Unh-unh. I'd use the 5-iron.

76
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:59,018
我想我还是用7号
I think I'll stick with the 7.

77
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,031
这样吧,赌50欧元,5号杆肯定打得更近
Tell you what. 50 euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.

78
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,078
赌100吧
Let's make it 100.

00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:41,075
无所事事
I do nothing.

87
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:44,075
无所事事可付不起这度假费哦
"nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here.

88
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:48,025
我是大笔赔偿款的受益者
I was the recipient of a large settlement.

89
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,041
公司并购吗?
Corporate merger?

看起来你说用5号杆是对的
It appears you were right about the 5 iron.

德语我只会说一句"这座位有人么?"

我在找波茨坦广场

114
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,035

请给我来杯蒸馏咖啡
Could I have an espresso,please?

119
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:28,085
什么风把你吹到柏林来了?
What sort of business brings you to berlin?

120
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:30,085
我是来物色人才的
I'm a headhunter.

121
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,038
帮公司招兵买马
A corporate recruiter.

122
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,068
我的老板是个经济学家  他专门研究新兴的市场
My employer is an economist. he works in emerging markets.

123
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:42,045
事实上  我还真不知道他是干什么的
Actually,i-i don't really understand what he does,

124
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:45,088
这也无所谓  因为我只是帮他购物就行了
Which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him.

125
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:48,081
这玩意一响
And if this goes off,

126
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:51,065
我就得马上出现在他面前
I'm at his side instantly,

127
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:54,031
其实这差事儿很棒 因为他一年只来柏林一两次
Which is wonderful since he's only in berlin once or twice a year.

128
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:58,011
所以你在这里享受 奢侈的午间咖啡

不管他们本来的企图是什么
Whatever their real agenda is,

145
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,048
明显他们内部的人都有事互相隐瞒
It's clear they're not sharing it.

146
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,075
也许Desmond能解释这一切
Maybe desmond can shed some light on this.

147
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,055
到海滩一去一回要多久?

00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,062
怎么做?
So how we gonna do this?

153
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,025
这种行动你不合适
You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.

154
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,032
这是哪种行动?
Well,and what kind of mission is that?

155
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,029
我去让Locke放了Charlotte
I'm going to make locke release charlotte,

156
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,059
而且要和平解决
And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.

157
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:17,003
我去了就得流血吗?
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

158
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:19,000
上次你见到他
The last time you encountered him,

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,093
你用枪指着他的头  还扣了扳机
You put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

160
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:24,017
这方法可不够好
That's not good diplomacy.

161
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,060
嘿  Jarrah
Hey. jarrah.

162
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:29,020
你想去找Charlotte不带我么?
You think you're going after charlotte without me?

163
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,087
当然不是
Of course not.

164
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,097
好的
Well,good.

165
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,023
还有什么事吗?
Is there anything else?

166
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,003
有啊  把枪给我
Yeah. give me my gun back.

167
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:44,036
10分钟后出发
We leave in ten minutes.

168
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:52,060
给我们个名字吧  阴谋家
Ready to give us a name,gizmo?

169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,087
James  他不会告诉你哪个是混进船上的间谍的
He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat,james.

170
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,073
是吗?  为什么不会呢?
Yeah? why not?

171
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,027
因为他想活命
Because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.

172
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,097
我有个主意
Well,here's an idea.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,047
我们把枪对着他的大脚趾
Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big toe

174
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,047
然后拿到市场上去卖
And send that little piggy to market?

175
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,027
如果他还不就范
And if he still doesn't want to tell us,

176
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,090
我们就来烤肉  这样可以吧
We'll move on to the roast beef. now why don't we do that?

177
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:15,013
那样的话我们就得背上他了
Because then we'd have to carry him.

178
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:38,013
John  还有多远?  我要给Aaron喂奶了
Hey,john,how much further is it? i-i need to feed aaron.

179
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,013
应该在这啊...  那个小屋
It should be here... the cabin.

180
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:43,082
可能我们迷路了  根本不在这
Maybe we got turned around. it could be anywhere.

181
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,012
不  肯定是这没错
No,it was here.

182
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:47,079
屋子里有什么东西这么重要?
Well,what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?

183
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,005
John想从某人那儿得到下一步的指示
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.

184
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,035
我想我弄错了
I guess I was mistaken.

185
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,035
这不重要
It doesn't... doesn't matter.

186
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,009
依计划行事  继续走  营地不远了
Plan's the same. we keep movin'. the barracks aren't far.

187
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,055
如果她的人和Jack在一起
If her team is with jack's group,

188
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,032
他们知道我们要去营地
They know we're going to the barracks.

189
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,032
红发女郎穿了防弹衣
Yeah,and red here was wearing a vest.

190
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,088
就表明她的人肯定准备跟我们火并一场
Which means her posse's gonna come Expecting themselves a gunfight.

191
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:18,052
 他们要的是她  我们就放她走
if all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go.

192
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:22,006
我是说  我们干脆藏起来
I mean,i thought we were just gonna go hide.

193
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,076
干嘛要带着囚犯
Why do we need to take prisoners?

194
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,056
-因为她还有利用价值  -怎么利用她?
We're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable. how is she gonna be valuable?

195
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,069
他是说将我做人质  亲爱的
He means as a hostage,luv.

196
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:32,019
不  我可不是来干这个的
Unh-unh. no,this is not what I signed up for.

197
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,016
-那你是来干什么的  -我意思是我们...
What did you sign up for,hugo? look,i'm just saying I think we

198
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,050
如果放她走  他们会觉得我们有诚意
If we let her go,they'll look at it as a sign of good faith.

199
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,085
他们会觉得我们很愚蠢 
They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, Which is what it would be.

200
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,050
我只是想提个妥协的建议 
I'm just trying to come up with some sort of compromise

201
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,052
妥协是没用的
We're beyond compromise.

202
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:47,049
现在  我说了算  Hugo
And right now,hugo,i'm making the decision.

203
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:50,025
你有意见吗
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

204
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,075
很糟糕吧?
Kinda sucks,huh?

205
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,059
什么?
what's that?

206
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,079
Sayid让你别去
Being told not to come along.

207
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,026
现在你明白我的感受了
Now you know what it feels like to be me.

208
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:14,086
是不是说我该等个20分钟  再跟他们去?
Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway?

209
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,066
好笑
touch?

210
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:28,031
你应该和他们走  Kate
You should go with them,kate.

211
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,008
你是认真的?
you're serious?

212
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,031
是的
yeah.

213
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,075
你不信任Sayid?
What,don't you trust sayid?

214
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,051
我不信任Locke
I don't trust locke.

215
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,085
万一他对我就像他对Naomi一样怎么办?
So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to naomi?

216
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,097
Sawyer不会让他这么干的
Sawyer won't let him.

217
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,035
还有我的位子吗
Got room for one more?

218
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,032
她有枪
Oh,yeah,she gets a gun.

219
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:10,062
万不得已才用枪
The gun's a last resort,kate

220
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,059
你也是这么对Locke说的?
You give locke that same speech?

221
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,062
我们出发吧
Hey! let's move out.

222
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,096
那个叫Sayid的  他是哪儿的人
This guy sayid-- where's he from?

223
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,009
伊拉克

00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:30,079
伊拉克?
iraq.

225
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,096
他能处理好这些事?
So he's just gonna go and work everything out?

226
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,092
他是干嘛的  外交官?
What was he,a diplomat?

227
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,076
不
No

228
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,012
他是个拷问官
He was a torturer.

229
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:58,012
Naomi  你们是朋友吗?
Naomi-- were you close to her?

00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,016
不  上了船才认识的
Nope. met her on the boat.

231
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,099
看来你对她的死没什么感觉
You don't seem particularly affected by her death.

232
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:07,009
不  我有感觉  她身材很辣  我替她感到惋惜
Sure I'm affected. she was hot,and I dug her accent.

233
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:08,052
真不错

而这个叫Charlotte的
And this woman--charlotte.

235
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:11,089
你也不太关心她  是不
You don't really care about her,do you?

236
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,016
怎么才算关心?
define "care."

237
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,009
朋友间的感情
So much for camaraderie.

238
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,009
对  谁是才是带枪追捕
Yeah,gee,who's the one going after

239

共同落难的朋友的人?
One of their crash buddies with guns?

240
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:21,009
事实上  我更关心Locke
Actually,i do care about locke.

241
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,076
也许你能告诉我
Maybe you can tell me

242
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,026
他是怎样让你们起内讧的
How he managed to split your happy little family in half.

243
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,079
我们为了你们
There was a fundamental debate

244
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,076
是来杀我们还是救我们
As to whether your people were coming to rescue us

245
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,096
而起了分歧
or kill us.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,013
那你是哪一派?
And which side did you land on?

247
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,020
我决定了就告诉你
I'll let you know when I decide.

248
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,030
你很英俊
You look fantastic.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,096
所以我才要带你去剧院
This is why I wanted to take you to the opera.

250
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,060
第五次约会还不能穿礼服  那就没必要约会了 
If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date,why bother?

251
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,030
你知道吗

252
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,023
我不会带着
I'm not bringing it.

253
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:31,023
如果他呼我了
If tonight's the night he calls,

254
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,003
就让他去吧
so be it.

255

我帮你带着
i'll carry it.

256
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:43,090
如果他真的呼了  我不想你怪罪我
If he does call,i don't want you fired over me.

257
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:46,096
你该跟他说  现在有更先进的
You should tell your employer that there is newer technology.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,053
我试过了  可他很保守
Well,i've tried. he's very old-fashioned.

259
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,023
你知道老板都这样
You know how bosses can be.

260
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,093
你有老板吗
Do you have a boss?

00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:13,026
我们初次见面时,你说你只在这待一周
I mean,when we met, you said you would only be in berlin for one week.

265
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,006
工作的进度比我想象的要慢
The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.

266
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,030
噢
oh.

267
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,040
是这样

268
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,036
真希望是因为我的缘故
I was hoping it was because of me.

269
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,033
走吧
Let's go.

Strauss在等着呢
Strauss awaits.

271
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,033

What's his story?

272
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,013
-Daniel?  -说不清
Daniel? ah,couldn't tell you.

273
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,070
他跟我说的  我都是左耳进
Half the stuff he says is way over my head.

274
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,027
右耳出
The other half goes way,way over.

275
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:33,011

Don't sweat it.He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.

离信号源还有5公里

零
Zero

305

我没看到

306
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,061
这太怪了
That's... weird.

307
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:54,064
这可不光是奇怪
That is far more than weird.

308
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:19,067
那些秋千是做啥的?  他们还有托儿所?
What's with the swing set? these people have day care?

309
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,047
你觉得他们到了吗?
You think they're here yet?

310
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:23,017
过去看看吧
Let's find out.

311

在那边
It's coming from in there.

312

放我出去  救救我

313
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:27,004
Hurley  怎么回事
Hurley,what happened?

314
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,086
他们把我撇下了
They left me.

315
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,014
Locke背离了原先的约定
Locke's gone off the reservation,man.

316
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,014
我是说  他带走了那个小妞
I mean,he took this one chick hostage,

317
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:37,099
他说是Walt叫他杀了Naomi的  
He said walt was the one Who told him to kill the other chick,and he

318
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,081
Walt?
walt?

319
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:41,074
伙计  别问了  我只是想和他辩论一下
Dude,don't ask. I was,like,just trying to argue with him

320
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:43,080
但是他就变脸了  但是
So he would just,like,you know,chill,but,

321
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,048
你能不能别唠里唠叨
uh-- how about you stop babbling,

322
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:48,074
-就告诉我们他们怎么了  他们在哪里?
Just tell us what happened to them? where are they?

323
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,054
-你是谁?  -他们去哪里了?  胖子
Who are you?Where the hell did they go,tubby?

324
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,094
太可怕了,这条船又给我们送来一个Sawyer
Oh,awesome. the ship sent us another sawyer.

325
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:56,078
Hurley  他们去哪儿了?
Hurley,where did they go?

326
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,091
我想他们光顾着绑我忘记给我说了
L-look,i guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me.

327
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:02,014
-我不知道  -因此他们全都走了
I don't know. and so they all left,all together?

328
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,010
对  他们很反常  Locke说船上的人
Yeah,they were freaked. locke said that the people on the ship

329
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:07,010
是来救Charlotte然后就会杀了我们
Were coming to rescue charlotte and then to kill us.

330
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,086
是这样吗
So... are you?

331
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,046
至少现在不是
Not yet.

332
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,090
他们提到过什么可以看出他们去哪儿了吗
Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?

333
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:21,006
Locke说过他们 
Uh,locke said they were

334
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,033
在离开以前会路过Ben的那所房子
Gonna go by ben's house before they took off.

335
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,063
-为啥他要去那里?  -就我所知
Why would he go there? for all I know,

336
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,077
-他们也把Ben给关在橱子里了  -Ben的房子在哪儿
They could've locked ben up in the closet,too. where's ben's house?

337
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,087
介意我请教你个问题吗?
Mind if I ask you a question?

338
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,023
但讲无妨
Shoot.

339

波士顿红袜队拿到了总冠军?
The red sox really win the series?

340
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:45,064
别惹我谈那个话题  好吗
Hey,don't get me started on that,all right?

341
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:48,067
我爸爸来自纽约布朗克斯  我热爱洋基队
My dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue.

342
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,060
真不敢相信,上百天没看球赛了
I can't believe.It's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.

343
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,097
那是弹头
It's the payload.

344
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,094
终于到了
It's finally here.

345
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,010
那是什么
What is that?

346
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,043
是个火箭
It's a rocket.

347
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,020
不不
Oh,no.

348
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,090
大事不妙
This is not good.

349
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,066
你的朋友们回来了
Your friends are back.

350
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,063
瞧啊
Look at that.

351
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,053
看能否找到显示他们去处的痕迹
Look for anything that might show where they've gone.

352
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:11,066
我从这里找
I'll start in here.

353
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,070
Sayid!
Sayid!

354
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,046
别担心  Kate没事
Don't worry. kate's fine.

355
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,066
干得好  Hugo
Good job,hugo.

356
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,053
抱歉  伙计
Sorry,dude.

357
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,050
很抱歉  Sayid  我不是针对你 
I'm sorry,sayid. nothing personal.

358
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,043
Locke在哪？
Where's locke?

359
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:42,043
正跟那个生气的中国人说话
Talking to that angry chinese guy.

360
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:45,026
我不会伤害你的  Hurley
I'm not going to hurt you,hurley.

361
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,076
是吗...我见过你象跳霹雳舞一样
Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck

362
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,033
用腿扭断了那人的脖子
With that break-dancing thing you do with your legs.

363
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:52,036
我可得掂量着点 
I think I'll hang back here.

364
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,036
那么...
Well...

365
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,086
我猜他们逃出了监狱
I guess they're running out of jail space

366
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:12,079
你知道  我已经输了一块钱了
I lost a dollar,you know.

367
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,046
怎么输的?
How'd you manage that?

368
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,096
我和John打赌你不会蠢到 
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough

369
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,019
为了朋友  像个诱饵似的被捕
To fall for your friend as bait.

370
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:23,089
你了解友谊?
What do you know about friendship?

371
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:27,092
我知道有个自己不信任的朋友是没用的
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.

372
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:36,042
我是你的囚犯了?
So what I'm your prisoner?

373
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:40,056
如果那么说能让你好受些的话 
If that sorta thing turns you on.

374
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:51,096
你和Locke混在一起干嘛
What are you doing here with locke?

375
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,066
-我没和他一起  -你就是  James
I'm not with him. yeah,you are,james.

376
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:58,009
-那你跟Jack在一起干嘛  -我和他一道  是因为我相信
Then what are you doing with jack? I went with jack because I believe

377
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:00,046
他能把我们带出岛
He can get us off this island.

378
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:07,032
我想这就是我们的区别所在
Then I guess that's the difference between us.

379
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:10,089
我没想着要走
I ain't lookin' to leave.

380
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,092
为什么不
Why not?

381
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:20,032
因为回去对我已经没什么意义了
Cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me.

382
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:23,082
那在这有什么好?
And what's here that's so much better?

383
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:26,052
你又为什么要回去  Kate?
Why do you wanna go back,kate?

384
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,089
那应该只会让你想起我们来这之前
Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail

385
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:34,032
你被关在监狱的日子
Before we landed here.

386
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:37,036
如果你认为除了手铐还有什么别的
So if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home

387
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,002
在等你回去的话
Other than handcuffs,

388
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:42,009
那你真是不清楚这个世界是什么样的
Then you really don't know how the world works.

389
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,052
看看周围  雀斑女
Look around us,freckles.

390
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,069
我们有房屋...
We got roofs over our heads...

391
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,099
有电  淋浴  床
Electricity,showers,beds.

392
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,029
多久  Sawyer?
How long,sawyer?

393
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,092
你觉得我们玩多久过家家?
How long do you think we can play house?

394
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,032
让我们拭目以待
Why don't we find out?

395
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,022
冰茶
Iced tea.

396
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,002
我觉得你可能口渴了
I thought you might be thirsty.

397
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,048
我渴了
I'm thirsty.

398
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,075
骗了你我很抱歉
I'm sorry about all the theatrics,

399
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:40,092
但是  我不知道你们会有多少人
But,uh,i didn't know how many of you there would be

400
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:43,035
也不知道你们有没有武器
Or whether you'd be armed.

401
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,008
我必须得...  保住自己
I had to... cover my bases.

402
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:47,008
你把Miles和Kate怎么了?
What have you done with miles and kate?

403
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:50,015
Kate跟Sawyer在一起  Miles在别的地方
Kate's with sawyer,and miles is somewhere else.

404
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:55,095
他很好  我只不过问了他一些问题
He's fine. all I did was ask him some questions.

405
00:29:56,018 --> 00:29:57,098
他回答了吗  -没有
Did he answer any? no.

406
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,085
你们抓的那个女人有没有说些什么?
Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?

407
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,005
没什么有用的
Not particularly.

408
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,081
-那么把她交给我吧  -我为什么要那么做?
Then why don't you turn her over to me? and why would I do that?

409
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,081
我同意这些人是群骗子
I agree that these people are liars.

410
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:13,001
他们来这也不是为了救我们
And they're certainly not here to rescue us.

411
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:14,081
但如果我把Charlotte完好地交给他们
But if I return safely with charlotte,

412
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:16,082
他们会让我一起上船
They'll take me to their ship.

413
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,082
这将会是我们找出它们真实身份
It's our best chance at finding out who they are

414
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,035
和意图的最好方法
And what they really want.

415
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,035
我能省去你这些麻烦  Sayid
Well,then,i can save you a lot of trouble,sayid,

416
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,055
因为Ben说有一个他的间谍在船上
Because ben says he's got a spy on the boat.

417
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,022
谁?
Who?

418
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,072
保密
It's a secret.

419
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:36,049
对不起,不过相信他就是出卖灵魂
Forgive me,but the day I start trusting him Is the day I would have sold my soul.

420
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,042
把Charlotte交给我
Give me charlotte,

421
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:40,049
允许我用自己的方式做事
Allow me to do things my way,

422
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:44,006
否则纷争一旦开始就不是我们能控制的了
Or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop.

423
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,013
我为什么要把Charlotte白白给你?
Why would I give you charlotte for nothing?

424
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,043
你误会了
Oh,i think you misunderstood me.

425
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,069
我没想让你把她白白交给我
I never expected you to give her to me for nothing.

426
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,039
穿衣服吧?
Should we get dressed?

427
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:12,009
不
No

428
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:16,016
我们总得在什么时候
Well  we're gonna have to get out of this bed

429
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,083
离开这张床吧
At a certain point

430
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:19,089
为什么?
Why?

431
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,079
为了这个
Well,for one thing,

432
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,095
因为我知道最终
Because I know that eventually

433
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:27,045
你必须要去工作
You're gonna have to go to that job of yours.

434
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:31,001
你知道  就是那个你从不肯谈起的工作
You know,the one you never talk about.

435
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,031
没什么可说的  就是份工作而已
There's nothing to talk about. it's just a job.

436
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,041
我对你一无所知
I know nothing about you.

437
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:44,068
我理解你不想谈那次坠机
I understand you don't want to talk about the crash,

438
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,091
你遭遇了什么?
What happened to you.

439
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,085
但现在的生活怎么样
But what about life now?

440
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,085
现在的你又如何?
What about you?

441
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,088
你就是这样谈恋爱的  对吧?
That's what you do when you're in love,right?

442
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,068
谈恋爱?
In love?

443
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,001
是啊
Yeah.

444
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,021
好
Okay.

445
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,028
我都实话说了吧
No more secrets.

446
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,018
你想知道些什么?
What do you want to know?

447
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,081
是他...
He's here...

448
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,081
我老板
