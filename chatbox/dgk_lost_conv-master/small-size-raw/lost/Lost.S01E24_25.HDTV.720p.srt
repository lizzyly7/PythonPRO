1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,030
我们这是在哪儿?
Guys... where are we?

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,038
我在沙滩上找到了一条金属线
I found the wire on the beach.

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,073
我以为这和我们用信号接收器收到的
I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up.

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:14,047
一个法国女人重复说了16年的话  会有点关系
with a Frenchwoman repeating on a loop for 16 years.

5
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:16,016
真的有这么久了么?
Has it really been that long?

6
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:18,003
是你
You.

7
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:19,038
你们的人...
Your people,

8
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,013
那些你决定了要回到他们那儿去的人...
the ones you're determined to get back to.

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,042
看紧他们
I'm alone now. Watch them closely.

10
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:30,008
我正在睡觉  一下子惊醒了  他正打算伤害我的孩子
On the island alone. I mean, I was sleeping, and I woke up,

11
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,072
我们必须弄清楚每个人是谁
We gotta find out who everyone is.

12
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,084
你想弄个人口普查?
Wanna start a census?

13
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,045
我问了在沙滩上的每一个人
I interviewed everyone at the beach.

14
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,059
Jack

15
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,066
其中一个不在旅客名单上
One of them isn't in the manifest.

16
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:41,091
他不是我们飞机上的人
He wasn't on the plane.

17
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:46,038
我们不是这个岛上唯一的一群人
We're not the only people on this island,

18
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:52,097
他们攻击我们  妨害我们  绑架我们  谋杀我们
They've attacked us! Sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us.

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,024
也许是时候该考虑一下怎么去对付他们了
Maybe it's time we started worrying about them.

20
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,071
Danielle?

21
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,040
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:06,093
当我看见黑烟的时候
When I saw black smoke...

23
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,042
你们只有3个选择...
You have only three choices.

24
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,064
我现在可以告诉你的是我们确实有了一个计划
All I can tell you is we do have a plan.

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,017
是的  你们到丛林里去找炸药然后炸开一个舱门
Go into the jungle, get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,

26
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,082
然后就可以让大家躲在里面了
and then you hide everyone inside.

27
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:28,062
天知道那些炸药在那儿多久了
God knows how long that dynamite has been out there.

28
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,001
所以如果你不想被炸飞的话
So, unless you want to blow up,

29
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,010
就让我一起去
I'm coming with you.

30
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,043
-祝你好运  -你也一样
-Good luck.  -Same to you.

31
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,069
马上会再见面的
See you soon.

32
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,000
扶正了
Keep it straight.

33
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:53,005

好了  推  推
Go, go!

35
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,032
再见了  Vincent
Bye, Vincent.

36
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,061
Claire  大家都准备走了
Claire. Everybody's leaving.

37
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,028
是的  我哪儿也不能去  行么?
Well, I can't go anywhere, all right?

38
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,030
我有个孩子  我太累了
I've got the baby and I'm... I'm so tired.

39
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,071
我不能带着他
I can't... can't carry him.

40
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:38,055
现在他又尿湿了
And now he's wet

41
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:42,011
边上又到处是沙子  我没有别的尿布了
and there's sand everywhere. I don't have anymore nappies.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,024
你怎么不让我帮忙?
Why don't you let me help?

43
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,005
不  听着  没人和我说过这该怎么办
No, look, nobody ever taught me how to do this. Okay?

44
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:47,077
Claire  会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

45
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,083
为什么大家都对我这么说?
Why do people keep telling me that?

46
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,059
他们难道也有孩子么?
Are they the ones with the baby?

47
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:55,021
我们得在太阳下山前赶到那儿
We've got to get there before sundown.

48
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:57,021
一旦你们到了洞里  就呆在那儿
Once you reach the caves, stay there.

49
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,037
其他的人会马上到的
The rest of us will be right behind you.

50
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,028
听着  我知道Jack把它们给你了
I know Jack gave 'em to you.

51
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,001
我现在就要一把  我想保护Claire
I want one right now. I have to protect Claire.

52
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,031
Rousseau说那些人在黄昏的时候才会来
Rousseau said the others won't be here till night.

53
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:15,067
Rousseau是可以相信  但万一他们提前来了呢...
She's certifiable. What if they show up before?

54
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,011
上次你用枪的时候...
Last time you had a sidearm...

55
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:19,037
我杀了一个杀人犯  我帮了大家
I killed a murderer. I did us a favor.

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,044
Charlie  你控制不了你的情绪  那些枪由我来处理
You're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons.

57
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,017
你不会永远都在这里  你保护不了Claire  听着  我要一把枪
You're not here all the time. You can't protect her. I need a gun.

58
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,041
如果你真的想要帮Claire
If you want to help Claire

59
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:29,020
就帮她去整理东西  帮她把孩子带去山洞那里
get her packed, carry her child to the caves.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,074
那才是她需要的
That's what she needs.

61
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,087
像这样的事怎么会发生的?
How exactly does something like this happen?

62
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,031
你和我在同在这个岛上  不是么?
Are you on the same island as I am?

63
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,040
这个解释还算不错
I guess that explains it.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,064
停下  停下  等等  停下  等等
Hold on, wait... Hold, wait.

65
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,007
我们在哪儿  在几英里深的岛内陆?
What are we, a couple miles inland?

66
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:17,024
海啸是有可能把这东西刮过来的  是么?
A tsunami probably swept it here. Huh? Right?

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,012
你去哪儿?
Hey.Hey, where are you going?

68
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,008
炸药就在船体里
The explosives are in the hold of the ship.

69
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,094
Rousseau  等等
Rousseau, wait.

70
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,043
你吩咐的我都做了
I did what you asked.

71
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,089
你需要的是炸药  你不需要我了
You need dynamite. You don't need me.

72
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:35,046
让她去吧  Jack
Let her go, Jack.

73
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,047
谁带我们回去?
Who's gonna lead us back?

74
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,087
我会带大家回去的
I'll lead us back.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,044
混蛋
Damn it.

76
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,096
你听她说了吧  炸药就在船体里面  我们走吧
You heard her. Explosives are in the hold. Let's go.

77
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,016
等等  等等
Hold on.

78
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,006
我来这儿是告诉你们怎样处理炸药
I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite,

79
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,036
不是和你们去鬼船探险的
not explore a ghost ship.

80
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,030
-你认为我会去...  -好了  好的  就呆在这儿吧
-You think...  -Just... stay out here.

81
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:09,025
我也和Arnzt一起呆在外面
I'm gonna stay out here and hang with Arnzt.

82
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,078
是奴隶
Slaves.

83
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:16,035
这艘船一定是准备去一个采矿的殖民地的
This ship must have been en route to a mining colony.

84
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:21,025
可能是从非洲的东海岸莫桑比克起航的
Probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa.

85
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,035
Jack  John  来一下
Jack. John. Over here.

86
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:14,041
然后我的第三个妻子  她说... 拿去  她说
and then my third wife, she says, get this,

87
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:15,076
我不是被你雇来的
"I didn't sign up for this."

88
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,070
现在你告诉我  这到底是什么意思?
You tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean?

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
我打扰你了么?
What, am I boring you?

90
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,026
呃?
Huh?

91
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,013
你知道么?  我...  我很抱歉
You know what? I'm sorry.

92
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,081
我...我很抱歉  我不够酷
I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough

93
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,058
我不能成为你们快乐的小冒险队的一员
to be part of your merry little band of adventurers.

94
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,022
什么?
What?

95
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:39,012
一看到这个小团体我就能知道  我是教高中的  伙计
I know a clique when I see it. I teach high school, pally!

96
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:45,058
你们这帮人认为你们是在这个岛上唯一做着有价值的事的人
You know, you people think you're the only ones on this island doing anything of value.

97
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,016
坠机事故中还有其他的40个幸存者
There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash,

98
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,069
并且我们也是一份子
and we are all people too.

99
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,088
好的
Okay.

100
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:01,033
你知道么?  我能把它打开一旦...
You know what,I can probably get it open if I just...

101
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,018
不  不  我们得搬出去
No. We should take it outside.

102
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,004
为什么? 我们甚至不知道... 
Why? You don't even know if this...

103
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:08,039
我们不会用镐去撬开一个写有"炸药"的板条箱的  Kate
You're not prying open a crate that says "Explosives" with a pickax.

104
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:10,017
我同意Jack说的
Yeah, I agree with Jack.

105
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,094
我们把它搬出去  在外面打开
Take it outside, open it there.

106
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,067
好吧
Okay.

107
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,002
我来搬
I got it.

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,069
去带路好么?
You mind showing us the way?

109
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,048
那也不是些十几岁的青少年
It's not just the teenagers.

110
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,032
体育老师  你认为他们在咖啡馆里会让我和他们一起坐么?
The gym teachers,you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria?

111
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:30,060
不  他们不会
No. They do not.

112
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,033
伙计  那全是你想出来的
This is all in your head.

113
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,095
真的么? 那么你向我解释一下
Really? You explain to me

114
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,095
为什么Kate用来做掩蔽处的飞机残骸是最好的?
why Kategets the best pieces of wreckage for her shelter?

115
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,019
还有那个韩国人...
And the Korean guy.

116
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,030
他抓的鱼分给了这个岛上的每一个人了么?
Does he catch fish for everybody on the island?

117
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,006
不  他没有  他没有
No. He does not. He doesn't.

118
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,011
并且在这儿的一些人明显瘦了不少
And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here.

119
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,068
现在你能告诉我你把食物都藏在哪儿了么?
You mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs?

120
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,008
因为我想不通...
'Cause I can't figure...

121
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,068
你们这些人到底在做什么?
What the hell are you people doing?

122
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,077
等等  等下  停  就停在那儿
Wait, wait. Stop. Stop right where you are.

123
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,043
好了  我要你们仔细慢慢放下箱子  仔细一点
Put that down carefully. Put it down carefully.

124
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,005
放得...轻一点  轻一点  混蛋
Put it gently...Gently. Damn it!

125
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:05,058
仔细一点  轻轻的  轻轻的
Carefully, gently. Gently.

126
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,033
好了  马上离开那儿  离远一点
Get outta there. Get away from it. Come on.

127
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,009
快点  走开  离它远点
Get out. Move away from it.

128
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,060
-到底这是...  -嘘  安静点
-What the hell is your...?  -Shh. Be quiet.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,066
你们有人知道么
Do any of you have any idea

130
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,032
给黄色炸药加上90度的热度会怎样?
what happens to dynamite in 90-plus degree heat?

131
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
恩? 你们知道么?
Huh? Do you know?

132
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,033
有人知道么?
Any of you?

133
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:36,026
它会化成硝化甘油
It sweats nitroglycerin.

134
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:42,010
你干吗? 我说过让你走近了么?
What are you doing? Did I ask you to come closer?

135
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,014
黄色炸药...
Dynamite...

136
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,093
是用黏土固定的硝化甘油
is nitroglycerine stabilized by clay.

137
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:06,040
硝化甘油是人们所知道的最危险最不稳定的炸药
Nitroglycerine is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man.

138
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,059
Kate  把你的衬衣给我
Hey Kate, gimme your shirt.

139
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:15,017
快  公主  把你的衬衣给我  我要把炸药包起来
Now. Princess, give me your shirt. I need to wrap the dynamite.

140
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,025
把它丢给我就好了  小心点
Just throw it to me, right here. Just be careful.

141
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,028
拜托  快点
Come on, hurry up.

142
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,028
好了 很好 现在后退 后退 后退
Okay, good. Now back up. Back up.

143
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,031
离我远点
Get outta my way.

144
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,049
你们有人听说过发明硝化甘油的那个人么?
Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin?

145
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:35,054
也许没有  因为他把自己的脸给炸了
Probably not, because he blew his freaking face off.

146
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:39,069
他的实验室助手进去后
His lab assistant came into the room,

147
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,089
看见他的导师引爆了炸药
saw that his mentor had detonated,

148
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:49,000
说道"恩 我想这东西很管用"
and he said: "Huh. I guess this stuff does work."

149
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,032
好了 我们拿了够用的就好
We're not gonna take more of this stuff than we need,

150
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,095
因为硝化甘油真的是很不稳定
because nitroglycerine is extremely temperamental.

151
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,002
那么我们就...
So we just...

152
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,064
伙计
Dude.

153
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,057
先生你的包是没人看管的
Sir, your bag was unattended.

154
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,099
-我可以走了么?  -可以了 先生
-Am I free to go?  -Yes, sir.

155
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,085
我要赶飞机
I have a plane to catch.

156
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,084
你能帮我拿一下纸巾么  朋友?
Could you hand me a paper towel there, bud?

157
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,097
一张纸巾  这个坏了
Uh, paper towel, this one's broken.

158
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:22,043
你不懂英语  对不起
Oh. You don't speak English. Sorry.

159
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,024
就是这张纸巾了

160
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,011
什么

161
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,056
我是为...

162
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,036
Paik先生工作的

163
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:46,065
你的岳父 也就是你的老板

164
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:50,009
你一直在跟踪我?

165
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,036
是的

166
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:58,000
我知道你打算逃跑

167
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,032
但你要把那块表...

168
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,060
带给Paik先生在加利福尼亚的朋友

169
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,071
如果你做了其他的事...

170
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,096
任何事

171
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,073
你就会失去她

172
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:20,044
你没有自由

173
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,098
你以前从没有过...

174
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:27,093
将来也不会有

175
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,035
爸爸  看
Dad, look!

176
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:07,066
这么大的一个地方怎么会没有人发现过?
How does a place this big never get discovered?

177
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,037
我不知道
Don't know.

178
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:14,083
但是你能在那儿建一个海滩度假别墅
But you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there.

179
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,018
好吧 你去建你的吧
Yeah, you build your resort.

180
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,078
我很开心能和这里永别
I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever.

181
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:26,039
其他人怎么样了? 他们还好吧?
What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay?

182
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,058
希望他们能安全吧  伙计
I hope so, buddy.

183
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,036
至少在我们叫来救援之前
At least until we can get 'em some help.

184
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,003
你在唱Bob Marley的歌?
Singing Bob Marley?

185
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,067

No.

186

00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,028
伙计  有谁不喜欢Bob Marley?
Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?

188
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,071
混蛋
Damn it!

189
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:43,067
那些东西你都要么?
Do you really need all that?

190
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,035
是的
Yeah. I do.

191
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,038
为什么你要带这么多?
Why do you have to bring so much?

192
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,018
你不是要带我们远足么?
Don't you have a hike to lead?

193
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,026

我们在做什么?
What are we doing?

198
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,042
躲起来?
Hiding?

199
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,029
好像他们找不到我们似的
As if they won't find us.

200
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,078
这只是...
It's just...

201
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,040
负担太重了
It's too much.

202
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,074
这太重了
It's too much.

203
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:31,015
如果我帮你承担一点的话就不会太困难了
It won't be too much if I carry it for you.

204
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,089

220

也许这不是最好的办法
Maybe this isn't the best way.

221
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,032
这是唯一的方法  Jack
It's the only way, Jack.

炸开那个舱门我们需要多少炸药?

这是飞机上的毯子

238
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,000
然后我用了这个木头这样穿过这个竹子
And then, this piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo.

00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:23,046
她的头
Her head.

303
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,006
他还好么?
Is he all right?

304
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,055
她抢走了我的孩子?
Did she take my baby?

305
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,097
她抢走了我的孩子是么?
Did she take my baby?

306
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,011
她往哪儿去了?
Which way did she go?

307
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:34,086
我不知道
I don't know!

308
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,069
她抢走了我的孩子
She took my baby!

309
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:40,003
全怪你  是你把他带到我们营地来的
This is your fault! You brought her into the camp!

310
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:41,048
当初如果你给我一把抢的话...
If you had given me a gun...

311
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,029
不准再打我了
Do not hit me again.

312
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,098
你是想浪费时间来抱怨么
You want to waste time assigning blame?

313
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,085
这些时间足够让我们去找她了
There's plenty to go around.

314
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,048
她先走了  如果我们现在就去  还能赶上她
She has a head start. If we leave now, we can catch her.

315
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,080
我们怎么能追上她?
How we gonna do that?

316
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,080
因为我知道她往哪儿去了
Because I know where she's going.

317
00:24:57,065 --> 00:25:00,008
不  不要...我要找回我的孩子
Please now... I want my baby.

318
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,048
你可以把炸药全部放我包里
I can carry all the sticks in my pack.

319
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,045
中间隔离的东西越多越好
The more insulation we stuff in, the better.

320
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,053
我想我们应该分开来拿
I think we should split 'em up.

321
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,038
什么?
What?

322
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:22,003
把它们放一起是很不明智的  我们还是分开带吧
It's not smart to keep it all together, so we split 'em up.

323
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,039
如果我们要3根来炸开舱门盖的话  我们就要带上6根炸药
If we need three sticks to blow the hinge, then we should bring six.

324
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,065
三个三个分开拿
Three and three.

325
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,063
以防万一我们其中一人...
A fail-safe. In case one of us...

326
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,076
那就你和我吧
You and me then.

327
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,003
不  我要带一包
No. I'm taking one.

328
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,083
这不可能  不行
Not gonna happen.

329
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,088
-我来这儿就是为了这个  -那么你就是白来了
-This is why I came.  -You wasted a trip.

330
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:42,059
我必须要这么做
I need to do this.

331
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:44,083
Kate  没人欠别人什么
Kate, no one owes anyone anything.

332
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,030
-我要带一包  -没得说了
-I'm carrying one.  -We're done.

333
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,029
-这不是由你来定的  -Kate 这就是由我来定的
-This is not your decision.  -It is.

334
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:49,073
我们抽签吧
We'll draw straws.

335
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,025
他们就要来了
They're coming...

336
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:55,030
我们没时间来决定由谁来冒这个险了  那么...
We don't have time to argue about who risks their life, so.

337
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,063
我们就让命运来决定吧
we let fate decide.

338
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,090
我同意
Works for me.

339
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,053
你呢?  也想带点炸药么?
What about you? You wanna carry some dynamite?

340
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,041
你的身上...
You got some...

341
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,008
Arnzt的...
Arnzt on you.

342
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:22,016
谁抽到短的就由谁来背炸药
Short sticks carry the packs.

343
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,041
就是你和我了  Kate
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

344
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,095
这东西是用来干嘛的?
So, what's this stuff even do?

345
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,073
这个是发报机  向别人发送求救信号的
Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening.

346
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,092
并且在这片海域里有什么动静的话
And if there's anything out there,

347
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,057
我们都可以在这个雷达屏幕里看到
we'll see it on this radar screen here.

348
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:07,003
开始吧
Here we go.

349
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,036
拜托
Come on.

350
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,014
来人救我们
Someone, find us.

351
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,027
这些都是大家写的信息
Those are messages everybody wrote.

352
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,077
当然是
Sure are.

353
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,026
他们是隐私的东西
They're private.

354
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:29,014
是的
Yep.

355
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:35,056
我从来没注意到Tracy是这么想念她在弗雷斯诺的丈夫和孩子们
I for one never knew how much Tracey missed her hubby and two kids back in Fresno.

356
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,033
但是她晚上还是睡在Scott身边取暖
Yet she's sleeping next to good ol' Scott to keep her warm at night.

357
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:42,075
那是Steve Scott死了
That's Steve. Scott's dead.

358
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:47,049
随便了  这旅途会很漫长  我们得找东西来开心开心
Whatever. Long ride, Kazoo. We gotta keep ourselves entertained.

359
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:53,031
Hugo究竟是谁  他怎么会留给他妈妈1亿6千万美元?
Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a hundred and sixty million dollars to leave to his mom?

360
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,034
如果我读你的你会怎么想?
How'd you like it if I read yours?

361
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,004
你读不到我的  因为我没写过
You can't 'cause I didn't write one.

362
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,023
为什么不写?
Why not?

363
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:03,074
因为我唯一写过的一封信是给我要去杀的那个人的
'Cause the only letter I ever wrote is to the man I'm gonna kill.

364
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:05,086
你为什么要杀他?
Why you gonna kill him?

365
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,068
因为我必须这么做
'Cause I need to.

366
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,015
就是因为
Because.

367
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,048
你在开什么玩笑?
Are you bloody joking?

368
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,019
她为什么会去黑烟那儿?
Why would she go for the black smoke?

369
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,087
那儿不就是"其他人"应该在的地方么?
Isn't that where the others are?

370
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:26,010
她去那儿就是为了找那些人
The others are why she would go there.

371
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:30,086
Rousseau告诉我们16年前她的孩子被抢了的当天她就看到了黑烟
Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago.

372
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:33,063
他们抢走了她的孩子
They took something from her.

373
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,025
现在她相信
And now she believes...

374
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:37,089
她有他们想要的东西
she has something they want.

375
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:40,008
她准备拿孩子做交换?
She's making a trade?

376
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,057
我相信她是这么想的
I believe she is. Yes.

377
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:43,086
太疯狂了  她脑子有病
That's insane. She's insane.

378
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:46,004
别指责她的所做所为
Don't apply reason to her actions.

379
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,026
她是一个失去孩子的母亲...就像Claire一样
She's a mother who lost her child. Just like Claire.

380
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,090
这次去不是为了报仇
This isn't about revenge.

381
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,018
别太自私
Don't make it personal.

382
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,036
我也要去
I'm coming with you.

383
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,074
这不行  Claire
That's not a good idea.

384
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:07,097
那是我的孩子  好么?  是我让她抢走的
This is my baby, okay. I let her take him.

385
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,052
-Claire 听着...  -别告诉我我该怎么做 可以么?
-Claire, listen.  -Don't tell me what to do!

386
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:11,011
冷静点
Calm down.

387
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,046
我也要和你们一起去
I am coming with you.

388
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:16,026
这全怪我 我要去 好么? 你阻止不了我的
This is my fault and I'm coming and you can't stop me!

389
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,099
-好了好了  -我也要去
-It's fine, all right. It's all right.  -I'm supposed to raise him.

390
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,067
把他带回来  Charlie
Get him back, Charlie.

391
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:33,028
把Aaron带回来
Get Aaron back.

392
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,018
Aaron?

393
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:40,007
求你把他带回来  求你了
Please. Get him back. Please.

394
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:44,014
Claire  我会把他带回来的  我保证
Claire, I will get him back. Promise.

395
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,053
你想吃点什么么?
Hey, you want something to eat?

396
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:12,010
我想你是不要了
I guess that's a "no" then.

397
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:24,076
如果你是在为Vincent担心  它会没事的  伙计
If you're worried about Vincent, he's gonna be okay, man.

398
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:27,036
狗坐飞机都是要进行李舱的
Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time.

399
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,064
好吧
All right.

400
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,063
我去打个电话
I gotta call work.

401
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,050
呆在这儿
Right over there.

402
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,038
哪儿都别去  好么?
Don't go anywhere, okay?

403
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,034
不  我住在小公寓住宅里
No, I live in a studio apartment.

404
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,095
我得在早上5点钟之前赶去工作
I gotta be out the door in the morning for work by 5am.

405
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:55,062
谁来照看他?
Who's gonna watch him?

406
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,077
他怎么去学校? 他放学后怎么办?
How's he getting to school? What about after?

407
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:59,032
我不能这么做  妈
I can't do this, Ma.

408
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:03,019
你知道  我...
You know, I was...

409
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,054
听着  我在想
Listen, I was thinking, um...

410
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,053
我在想也许你能照看一下他
I was thinking maybe you could take him.

411
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,061
妈  如果这是钱的问题的话 我...
But Ma, if it's a question of money, I...

412
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,090
然么我该拿他怎么办?
What am I supposed to do with him?

413
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:25,066
他不应该是我的
He's not supposed to be mine.

414
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,080
这可不是当初就想好的
This was never part of the plan.

415
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,050
好吧  我...
Yeah, I...

416
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:53,087
伙计
Hey, man.

417
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,099
-我在  呃...  -我要新电池
-I was, uh...  -I need new batteries.

418
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:07,023
要试一下么?
You wanna try?

419
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,056
-什么?  -来吧 过来
-What?  -Come on, come here.

420
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:11,032
你来试着驾驶一会儿
You drive for awhile.

421
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,098
-真的么?  -是啊
-Really?  -Absolutely.

422
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,092
好的  听着  舵是船最重要的部分
Okay, now. Look.The most important part of this boat is the rudder.

423
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,002
我告诉你怎么掌舵
It's how you steer.

424
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:21,002
慢慢地转动  别太用力  好么?
You turn it gradually. Nothing sharp, okay?

425
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:22,047
往这儿推
Push it this way.

426
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,050
我们往哪儿走?
Where are we going?

427
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,062
看
Look.

428
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,066
我们大约是往北方或东北方向移动
So we're going approximately north by northeast.

429
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,012
这样我们就会有希望驶上海洋航线...
So hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane.

430
00:32:36,098 --> 00:32:38,042
或是看到陆地之类的
Or we hit some land.

431
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:41,002
我该怎么找准方向?
What do I aim for?

432
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,088
看到地平线那儿的云了么?
See that cloud on the horizon?

433
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,057
恩
Yeah.

434
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,031
你就朝那儿走吧
You aim for that.

435
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:51,030
-好的  -我知道了
-Okay.  -Got it.

436
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,013
为什么你和我妈妈不住在一起呢?
How come you and my mom didn't stay together?

437
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,012
我们尝试过了
We tried.

438
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,006
但没有用  我们的生活  我们的爱好...
It just didn't work out. So our lives, our interests

439
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,065
完全是不同路的
just went in different directions.

440
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,015
那为什么我从没见到过你?
How come I never saw you?

441
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,053
因为你妈妈不想让我见你
'Cause your mom didn't want me to.

442
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,044
她认为她做的一切都是为你好
She did what she thought was best.

443
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:28,035
她错了
She was wrong.

444
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,049
舵
Rudder.

445
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,053
舵掉了
We lost the rudder.

446
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,081
舵  舵
Rudder. Rudder.

447
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,036
它沉下去了  我们会丢了舵
We're losing it! It's sinking!

448
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,048
把船停下
Stop the boat.

449
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,024
把船停下
Stop the boat!

450
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,005
把帆收起来
Just pull the sail down.

451
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,057
爸爸

Some of us have a bloody flight to make.

606
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:46,009
抱歉 借过
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:48,048
抱歉  抱歉  抱歉
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

抱歉  抱歉  小心  借过
Excuse me. Excuse me. Look out! Excuse me.

611
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:28,064
抱歉  抱歉  小心  抱歉
Excuse me. Excuse me. Look out. Coming through.

612
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:47,004
能快点么?  我妈明天生日
Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

613
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:51,065
或是今天  我不知道  我不想换另一架班机
Or... today. I don't know, I don't really get the whole time change thing,

614
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:52,094
我一定要上飞机
but I gotta make that flight.

615
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,066
我已经尽可能的快了  亲爱的
I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear.

616
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,090
你的座位号是20G
You are confirmed for seat 20-G.

617
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:04,044
不过航空公司有规定  像你这种体积的人要买两张票
However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.

618
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:08,062
什么? 我来的时候没买两张票啊
What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.

619
00:53:08,072 --> 00:53:10,060
你要称一下你有多重么  亲爱的?
Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?

620
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,011
好了  无所谓了
Fine. Whatever.

621
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:16,001
我再买一张紧挨着的座位票
I'll buy the one next to it.

622
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:19,094
好的  两张票
Alrighty. Here's two together.

623
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:27,078
呃哦  呃哦什么?
"Uh-oh"? What "uh-oh"?

624
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,081
看来你的航班已经在海洋国际航班检录处开始检票登机了
It appears that your flight is already boarding in the international terminal.

625
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:34,074
这儿是国内航班登机处
This is the domestic terminal.

626
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:37,057
我认为你赶不上这趟飞机了  亲爱的
I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.

627
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:52,015
抱歉
Sorry.

628
00:53:52,054 --> 00:53:53,041
抱歉  借光
Pardon me.

629
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:55,011
抱歉  不好意思
Excuse me. Sorry.

630
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:58,037
抱歉  抱歉  借光
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,015
不好意思
Sorry.

636
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:13,065
不好意思  很紧急  我只好插队了
Sorry,this is an emergency. I gotta...I gotta cut through.

637
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,030
抱歉  伙计  伙计
Excuse me. Dude. Dude.

638
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,024
-回去排队  -我要赶不上...不
-Back of the line.  -Let me go ahead. I'm gonna miss my...

639
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:20,035
-回去排队  -你不明白  这是...
-Back of the line.  -You don't understand. This is...

640
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:21,077
回去排队
Back of the line.

641
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,023
下一个
Next.

642
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,041
现在?  你现在就要把电脑拿出来么?
Now? You're taking the computer out now?

643
00:54:39,095 --> 00:54:41,023
老伙计
Hey! Old guy!

644
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:46,047
我给你500美元  借我一下你的车好么
I'll give you 500 to borrow your scooter.

645
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:48,081
我刚做了臀部移位  我需要这东西
I just had a hip replacement. I need this.

646
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:50,008
好吧

00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:52,051
1600美元
Sixteen hundred bucks.

648
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:59,024

00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:24,086

Hey! Hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door!

658
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:31,053
等...等等关门
Hold... Hold the door!

659
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,038
我得上这架飞机
I gotta get on... this flight!

660
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:38,080
先生  登机口已经关闭了
Sir, the Jetway's closed.

661
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:42,049
求你了  我代表全世界的真爱和圣洁
Please. For the love of all that is good and holy in the world,

662
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:43,088
求你让我登机吧
let me on this plane.

663
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,048
好吧  等一下
All right, one second.

664
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:54,011
Hunter我是Jenna  这儿还有一个人
Hunter? This is Gina. We've got one more.

665
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,051
好的
Ta.

666
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:02,001
今天是你幸运的一天
This is your lucky day.

667
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:20,083
4  8  15  16  23  42

668
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,042
-4,8,15,16,23,42  -你在说什么?
-4,8,15,16,23,42  -You say something?

669
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,053
没什么
Nope.

670
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,076
我想我听见了"23"
I thought I heard 23.

671
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:37,098
那对你有什么意义么?
Does that mean something to you?

672
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:39,031
什么?
What?

673
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:41,009
那个数字"23"
That number? 23?

674
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:48,014
那个在澳大利亚收留过我的人
The guy who called the feds on me back in Australia

675
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:51,017
为了23000的赏金出卖了我
did it for a $23,000 reward.

676
00:56:54,006 --> 00:56:55,018
对你有什么意义么?
Mean something to you?

677
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,041
没有
Nah.

678
00:56:58,027 --> 00:56:59,030
只是一个数字
It's just a number.

679
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:01,084
我们得赶上去了
Better catch up.

680
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,019
快看不见他们了
I can barely see 'em.

681
00:57:15,076 --> 00:57:17,057
我们不能离得这么近  Jack
We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.

682
00:57:18,037 --> 00:57:19,089
如果爆炸了  就一起被炸吧
If we blow up, we blow up.

683
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:25,032
到底是怎么一回事  John?
What the hell was all that about back there?

684
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:26,026
什么怎么回事?
What was what about?

685
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:28,055
-在那儿你让我松手  -恩 是的
-You asked to let you go.  -That's right.

686
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:30,036
不  那东西正在把你往洞里拉
That thing was taking you down the hole.

687
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,025
-它不会伤害我的  -不 John 它会杀了你
-It wasn't gonna hurt me.  -It was gonna kill you.

688
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,071
我绝对表示怀疑
I seriously doubt that.

689
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:37,003
听着  我需要你...
Look, I need for you to...

690
00:57:37,085 --> 00:57:41,012
我需要你向我解释你脑子里到底在想什么  John
I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head.

691
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,035
我想知道你为什么认为那个东西不会...
I need to know why you believe that thing wasn't gonna...

692
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,024
我相信我正在被考验
I believe that I was being tested.

693
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,089
-考验?  -是的 考验
-Tested.  -Yeah. Tested.

694
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,084
我想这就是为什么我们有时不能互相了解的原因 Jack
I think that's why you and I don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

695
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:56,073
因为你是一个相信科学的人
Because you're a man of science.

696
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:59,073
是的  那你呢?
Yeah. And what does that make you?

697
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:02,081
我?  我是一个相信命运的人
Me? Well, I'm a man of faith.

698
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:08,098
你真的以为这些都是一场事故么?
Do you really think all this is an accident?

699
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:12,070
我们  一帮陌生人  幸存了下来
That we, a group of strangers, survived.

700
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:15,005
其中很多人都只是受了很浅的一点伤
Many of us with just superficial injuries.

701
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:18,040
你以为我们是凑巧坠落到这个地方的么?
You think we crashed on this place by coincidence?

702
00:58:18,047 --> 00:58:19,090
尤其是这个地方?
Especially this place.

703
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:24,027
我们被带到这儿来是有目的有原因的  我们大家都是
We were brought here for a purpose. For a reason. All of us.

704
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:28,037
我们每个人被带到这儿来都是有原因的
Each one of us was brought here for a reason.

705
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:30,003
被带来这里
Brought here?

706
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,035
是谁把我们带来这里的  John?
And who brought us here, John?

707
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,086
是这个岛把我们带到这儿来的
The island brought us here.

708
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:42,069
这不是一个寻常的地方  你也看见了  我知道你看见了
This is no ordinary place. You've seen that, I know you have.

709
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:46,028
这个岛也选择了你  Jack
The island chose you too, Jack.

710
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,095
这就是命运
It's destiny.

711
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:54,017
你和Boone也谈过命运了么  John?
Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?

712
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:02,039
Boone是这个岛所要求的牺牲品
Boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded.

713
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,037
他在那架飞机里所发生的一切
What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events

714
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:12,097
是把我们带到这儿来的一系列事件中的一件
that led us here,

715
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,034
这些事让我们走到了同一条路上
that led us down a path,

716
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:18,040
它们带我们到了今天  到了现在
that led you and me to this day, to right now.

717
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,056
这条路什么时候是个尽头  John?
And where's that path end, John?

718
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:25,055
尽头就在舱门那儿
The path ends at the hatch.

719
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:28,039
那个舱门  Jack
The hatch, Jack.

720
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,077
全部  发生的全部的事都是为了让我们能够打开舱门
All of it. All of it happened so we can open the hatch.

721
00:59:30,082 --> 00:59:34,049
不  不  我们打开舱门是为了能幸存下来
No. No, we're opening the hatch so that we can survive.

722
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,063
幸存也是很有关系的  Jack
Survival is all relative, Jack.

723
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:47,015
我不相信命运
I don't believe in destiny.

724
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,009
不  你相信的
Yes, you do.

725
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:54,098
你只是还不了解罢了
You just don't know it yet.

726
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:19,061
我刚刚才打开过的
I turned it on a little while ago.

727
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:21,024
Sayid说过每小时打开一次
Sayid said every hour.

728
01:00:21,098 --> 01:00:25,092
听着  我们已经离岛15英里远了  我们可能会在这儿呆上好几个星期
Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks.

729
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:28,097
-如果电池用完了...  -他说了 每个小时
-If that battery runs out...  -The man said every hour.

730
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,095
5分钟  不能再长了
Five minutes. No more.

731
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,063
好  好
Aye, aye.

732
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,075
知道我喜欢你的哪一点么  Mike?
Know what I like about you, Mike?

733
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:46,082
你有圣人才有的耐心
You got the patience of a saint.

734
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:48,096
是么?  为什么你这么说?
Yeah? Why you say that?

735
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:51,076
我看到了他对你说话的方式
I've seen the way he talks to you.

736
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:55,033
他跑来跑去  做他愿做的事
The way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants.

737
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,028
如果是我我早就会狠狠打他一顿了
I'd have shown him the back of my hand a long time ago.

738
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,054
你会的  是么?
You would, huh?

739
01:01:02,022 --> 01:01:03,093
是的  你说对了
Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

740
01:01:05,022 --> 01:01:08,091
那是你父亲对待你的方式么?  狠狠打你一顿?
Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?

741
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:11,031
我的爸爸没机会打我
My daddy never got a chance to beat me.

742
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,014
在我8岁的时候他开枪自杀了
Shot himself when I was eight.

743
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,012
这就是为什么你这么想死了?
That why you wanna die?

744
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,016
什么?
What?

745
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,099
自从你说你想上救生艇开始  我就想不通了
Since you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out.

746
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:31,052
为什么一个只知道关心自己的人会冒着生命危险去救其它人?
Why's a guy who only cares about himself wanna risk his life to save everyone else?

747
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:35,098
就我所知道的  这只有两个可能
Way I see it, there's only two choices.

748
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:38,067
你如果不是想成为一个英雄
You're either a hero,

749
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:40,050
就是想死了
or you wanna die.

750
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:48,097
我不是英雄  Mike
Well...I ain't no hero, Mike.

751
01:01:59,077 --> 01:02:01,029
这代表了什么?
That what I think it is?

752
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,058
有东西在那边
Something's out there.

753
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:33,037
不好意思  先生  我们为残疾乘客特制的轮椅...
I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading disabled passengers,

754
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,063
我们一下子找不到了
no one seems to know where it is right now,

755
01:02:35,072 --> 01:02:38,050
在我们找到那张轮椅之前  我们无法让你登机
and unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.

756
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:41,000
明天之前已经没有班次了
There's not another flight till tomorrow.

757
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:43,037
是的  我知道  先生  但是我真的没办法
I'm aware, but there's nothing I can do.

758
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:45,019
我能带着 Michelle  我们可以把他抬上去
Look, I can get Michelle. We can carry him on.

759
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,005
你不介意我们把你抬上去吧?
Mind if we carry you on?

760
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,053
不  那样很好
No, that would be fine.

761
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:02,019
就是这儿了
Here we go.

762
01:03:03,022 --> 01:03:04,059
这儿是你的座位
Here's your seat.

763
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,058
我把你的包拿来  先生
I'll get your bags, sir.

764
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,035
如果有什么需要的  只要按这个钮就行了
If you need anything, press the "call" button.

765
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,007
好的
Okay.

766
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:21,030

Got it.

769
01:04:29,025 --> 01:04:30,003
小心点
Be careful.

770
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:35,001
给我一个手电筒好么?
Can I have a flashlight?

771
01:04:36,024 --> 01:04:38,034
因为  火把围着一根炸药
'Cause, uh, the torch around the dynamite thing,

772
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,002
对我来说太离奇了
 not making sense to me.

773
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:46,003
Kate  你来牵导火索
Kate, you run the fuse.

774
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:49,098
Jack和我来装炸药
Jack and I will rig the charges.

01:04:50,017 --> 01:04:51,022
好的
Okay.

01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:30,049
那到底是什么?
What the hell is that?

777
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:35,009
看不见有脚印  没有什么痕迹
There's no footprints, no tracks.

778
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:38,098
就这些了? 这就是黑烟?
This is it? This is the black smoke?

779
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,074
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

780
01:05:42,077 --> 01:05:43,074
我不知道
I don't know.

781
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:56,054
Danielle?

782
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,043
马上

783
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:02,053
冷静点
Calm down.

784
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,014
Danielle

785
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:09,064
我听到你在那儿了  出来吧

They were not here.

01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:28,036
Danielle  你得把孩子给我们
Danielle, you have to give us the baby.

01:06:30,094 --> 01:06:31,095
我只是...
I just

790

想要回我的Alex
wanted my Alex back.

791
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,083
我以为...
I thought

792
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:40,095
如果我把这孩子交给他们...
if I gave them the baby...

793
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,087
好了
It's okay.

794
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,089
我知道
I know.

795
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,062
没事了
It's okay.

01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,082
我拿稳了
I got him.

797
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:29,069
从来就没有什么"其他人"
There never were any others.

798
01:07:30,024 --> 01:07:32,000
火是你自己点起来的
You started the fires yourself!

799
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:36,038
不  我听见他们的耳语声了
No. I heard them whispering.

800
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:37,052
你傻掉了
You're a nut job.

801
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:38,097
你根本什么也没听见
You heard nothing.

802
01:07:39,075 --> 01:07:42,074
我听见他们说他们会来抢走孩子
I heard them say they were coming for the child.

803
01:07:44,008 --> 01:07:47,042
"其他人"说他们会来抢走这男孩的
The others said they were coming for the boy.

804
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,042
你这个可怜虫
You're pathetic.

805
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:19,048
线
Wire.

806
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:30,004
抓住另一头
Hold that end.

现在是导火索了
Now the fuse.

808

-只能弄这么远了  -够远了

811
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:41,073
你们找个掩体躲好  我有足够的时间可以逃走
You take cover. There'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.

812
01:09:45,026 --> 01:09:46,036
等一下
Wait. Just a sec.

813
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:57,069
那么刚才在那儿是怎么回事?
What was that about back there?

814
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,071
什么怎么回事?
What was what about?

815
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:03,072
把炸药放在你的包里
Putting the dynamite in your pack.

816
01:10:05,025 --> 01:10:06,045
我做了一个判断与抉择
I made a judgment call.

817
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,038
我们是抽签的
We drew straws.

818
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:12,001
抱歉 但是我不会让像那样抽签来替我们做抉择的 Kate
I'm not gonna let drawing straws make decisions like that.

819
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,005
你没有权利这样
You had no right.

820
01:10:13,013 --> 01:10:16,006
每个人都想让我来当领导者  直到我做出了他们不喜欢的决定
Everybody wants me to be a leader till I make a decision they don't like.

821
01:10:16,054 --> 01:10:18,022
你想就这样一直在事后才来劝告我么  Kate?
You want to keep second guessing me?

822
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:19,063
那就是你的事了
That's your call.

823
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:22,007
你要知道一点
There's something you need to know.

824
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:26,023
如果我们这次活下来了  我们今晚就活下来了...
If we survive this, if we survive tonight...

825
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:30,060
我们还会有Locke的问题要解决
we're gonna have a Locke problem.

826
01:10:36,008 --> 01:10:38,005
现在我想知道你是支持我的
And I have to know that you've got my back.

827
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:42,009

停下  别点  我们不能这么做
Stop, don't light it! We can't do this!

What are you doing? Why'd you do that?

840
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:35,026
等等  这些数字不是好数字
Wait! The numbers are bad!

841
01:11:35,093 --> 01:11:36,098
这些数字不是好数字
The numbers are bad!

842
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:41,099
Hurley 停下 Hurley 你得赶快回来
Hurley, Stop!Hurley, You gotta get back.

843
01:11:42,009 --> 01:11:44,005

-把信号枪给我  -等一下
-Give me the damn flare gun.  -Hold on.

846

越来越近了  告诉你  看看吧
It's closer. I'm telling you.

847
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:12,006
听着  我知道  好么?  我只有一发信号  就一发
I know, okay. I've got one flare. One flare.

Okay. I know. You don't see anything.

849
01:12:14,055 --> 01:12:15,093
你还等着能看见什么?
What the hell are you expecting?

850
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:18,001
万一你没看见呢  现在一片漆黑
In case you haven't noticed, it's dark.

那是什么?  是一艘船么?
What is it? Is it a ship?

852
01:12:19,075 --> 01:12:21,041
我们不知道  小伙计  我们不知道
We don't know, little man.

853

我们不知道这是什么  任何东西都有可能
We don't know what it is. It could be anything. Junk.

We don't know if Sayid's radar works.

漂浮着的舢板知道改变航线  恩?

863

866
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,087
你能怎么样  向我开枪?
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?

我们在一个岛上呆了快一个月了  伙计
We've been on an island for a month, man.

飞机坠毁  恩?  呃  到底怎么回事?
Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that!
