你有什么事瞒着我?

为一家石油公司做合同翻译

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,120
算不上什么异国之旅... 而且极其枯燥

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,910
干洗生意... 做起来也是有一定风险存在的

解什么惑?
Answers to what?

52

我们从那台机器开始说起
Let's start with that machine.

53
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,000
你们把我绑在这东西上
You hooked me up to this thing,

54
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,330
还扎了我几针
you stuck needles in me,

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,180
你说这是一个测试
and you called it a test.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,790
各人心中一杆秤
For every man, there is a scale.

57
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,190
秤的一边 是善
On one side of the scale, there is good.

58
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,240
另一边... 是恶
On the other side... evil.

59
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,680
这台机器告诉我们
This machine tells us

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,660
秤的平衡度如何
how the scale is balanced.

61
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,650
而你的秤...
And yours...

62
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,810
倾斜向了错误的一边
tipped the wrong way.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,340
这就是你要毒死我的原因?
And that's why you tried to poison me?

64
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,020
没错
Yes.

65
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,810
我觉得 你死了会比较好
I think it would be best if you were dead.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,770
你以为你了解我 实际上大错特错
You think you know me, but you don't.

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,040

离开这儿

别回来了
Never come back.

72
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,940
你准备好了么?

73
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,550
为什么让我去?
Why does it have to me be?

74
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,790
我是说 你可以让Sawyer或Jin或...
I mean, you could send Sawyer or Jin or...

75
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,070
- 自己去做  - 如果我可以自己解决的话
- do it yourself.  - If I could do it myself,

76
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,470
我不会来找你 Claire
I wouldn't be asking you, Claire.

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
如果我去的话

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,640
我必须确保 你能实践诺言
I need to know you'll do what you said.

79
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,050
我要找回我的儿子

80
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,110
我会信守诺言的
I always do what I say.

81
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,040
你会伤害他们吗?
Are you gonna hurt them?

82
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
我只会对那些不听话的人下手
Only the ones who won't listen.

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:52,200

00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,067
债主却...

00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,887
他说 我还欠他每个月的利息没还...
He says I still owe him interest every month...

95
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:43,737
我的店开多久 就得按月支付他多久的利息

96
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:45,887
如果你缺钱 我可以借给你...

- "Convince" them?  - Sayid, don't forget who you're talking to.

我知道你打仗的时候做过什么

101

你曾是共和国卫队的审讯官

我知道你的底细
I know what kind of man you are.

103
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,457
如果你以为

104
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,497
光凭你商业决策失误 我就会去害人...

105
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,547
听我说 这不光是我一个人的麻烦!

108
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:20,847
拜托了
Please.

109

听着... 我知道你很在乎Nadia

110
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,537
如果你还在乎我们... 在乎她...
If you care about us... about her...

111
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,377
你会去的 Sayid
you will do this, Sayid.

112
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,417
抱歉
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:43,187
我早已脱胎换骨了

他们赶我走
I've been banished.

117
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,867
赶你走? 为什么?
Banished? For what?

118
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,257
很明显 我是个不祥之人
Apparently, I'm evil.

119
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,437
这些人说 我最好一死了之...
These people say I'm better off dead...

120
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:17,907
虽然这听上去让人不敢置信
Which is surprising,

121
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,817
毕竟是他们救了我一命
considering they were the ones who saved my life.

122
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,427
呃 事实上 你不是他们救活的 他们...
Well, actually, they're not. They...

123
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,717
他们试过要救你 但...
They tried to save you, but...

124
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,787
你最后还是死了 兄弟
you were dead, man.

00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,237
死了2个小时
For two hours.

126
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,877
相信我 当... 当... 当你坐起来的时候
Trust me, when... when... when you sat up,

127
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,947
他们跟我们一样吃惊
they were just as surprised as the rest of us.

128
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:44,327
不管究竟是什么把你救活的 反正不是他们
So whatever brought you back, it wasn't them.

129
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:48,827
别动
Hold it.

130
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,007
停! 别开枪!
Stop! Don't shoot her!

131
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,387
你来这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

132
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:02,907
他想见你
He wants to see you.

133
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,347
说英文
Speak English.

134

你知道是谁
You know who.

136
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:16,737
如果他想见我 叫他自己来
If he wants to see me, then tell him to come in.

137
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,537
不 他要你去找他
No, he wants you to go to him.

138
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:20,607
他就在墙外面等着
He's waiting outside beyond the outer wall.

139
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:21,517
我不傻
I'm not a fool.

140
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,687
如果我走出这所寺庙...
If I step outside this temple...

141
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,397
他就会杀了我
he'll kill me.

142
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:31,457
嗯 那你也许该派个 他不会杀的人去
Well, then maybe you should send someone he won't kill.

143
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,027
拦住她!
Stop her!

144
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,997
把这个女孩关到山洞里去 事情解决后再说
Put the girl in the hole until this is resolved.

145
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,887
立刻带Shephard和Reyes去我房间
Then bring Shephard and Reyes to my room immediately.

146
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,717
啊 那有点儿困难
Ah, that's gonna be a little difficult.

147
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,277
他们失踪了
We can't find them.

148
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,057

快去找!

149
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,807

你的朋友... Shephard和Reyes...
Your friends... Shephard and Reyes...

154
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,877
你知道他们去哪儿了吗?
do you know where they went?

155
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,587
不 我不知道
No, I don't.

156
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,427
Claire为什么在这儿?
Why is Claire here?

157
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,327
她说的话是什么意思?
And what was she talking about?

158
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,917
她被一个愤怒的人
She's a confused girl,

159
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,257
迷惑了
under the influence of an angry man.

160
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:48,277
谁?
What man?

161
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,487
多年来
For years,

162
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,267
他受困于此
he has been trapped.

163
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,617
但现在Jacob去世了
But now Jacob's gone.

164
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,237
他就自由了
He's free.

165
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:03,927
这个人 不摧毁岛上的一切生灵
This man will not stop until he has destroyed

166
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:07,607
是不会罢休的
every living thing on this island.

167
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,747
他是恶魔的化身
He is evil incarnate.

168
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,257
你想让我去和他交涉?
And you want me to speak to him?

169
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,317
不
No.

170
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,727
我希望你干掉他
I want you to kill him.

171
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,847
他会扮成你认识的某人...
He will come to you as someone you know...

172
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,197
死去的某人
Someone who has died.

173
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,037
你一见到他...
As soon as you see him...

174
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,337
就把这个深深插进他的胸口
plunge this deep into his chest.

175
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:38,217
如果你等他开口说话之后
If you allow him to speak,

176
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,667
那就来不及了
it is already too late.

177
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,037
自打我来到这里
Since I've been here,

178
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:47,357
你们淹我 打我 折磨我
I've been drowned, beaten and tortured at your hands.

179
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,637
我为什么还要帮你做事?
Why would I ever do anything for you?

180
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:55,507
你自己说 你是个好人
You said that there is still good in your soul.

181
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,607
那就证明给我看
Then prove it.

182
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:07,809
嘿 等等我!
Hey, wait up!

183
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,759
Sayid叔叔 你会待多久?
How long are you staying, Uncle Sayid?

184
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,579
还待几天
Just a few more days.

185
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,449
我得去多伦多...
I have to go to Toronto...

186
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:18,299
工作
to work.

187
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,449
我们喜欢你在这里
We like it when you're here.

188
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,799
是的 妈妈也喜欢
Yeah, and mommy likes it, too.

189
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,509
好的 乖乖的
Okay. Be good.

190
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,949
Sayid啊!
Sayid!

191
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,569
Omer啊!
Omer!

192
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,099
我的丈夫还好吗?
Is my husband going to be all right?

193
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,339
我们马上就给他动手术
We're taking him into surgery now.

194
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,609
- 他的肺被刺穿 并伴有大出血  - 到底怎么回事 你知道吗?
- He's suffered a punctured lung and some internal bleeding.  - Do you know how this happened?

195
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,129
急救队认为 他遇到了劫匪
E.M.T.s think he was mugged.

196
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,289
他的情况一稳定下来 我立即通知你们
I'll come get you as soon as he's stable.

197
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:15,899
- Sayid! 你去哪儿?  - 待在这里陪Omer
- Sayid! Where are you going?  - Stay here with Omer.

198
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,469
这不是打劫 对吧?
This wasn't a mugging, was it?

199
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,739
不管你想干什么...
Whatever you're thinking of doing...

200
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:23,969
别那么做
don't do it.

201
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,449
我不想你那样
I don't want you to.

202
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,679
求你了... 就...
Please... Just...

203
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:30,989
回家吧
go home.

204
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,659
去等孩子们
Wait for the kids.

205
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,569
让他们感受到安全 Sayid
Make them feel safe, Sayid.

206
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,909
行吗?
Will you do that?

207
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,049
嘿?
Hello?

208
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,409

Sayid?

209
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:57,169
你好 Kate
Hello, Kate.

210
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,269
你要走吗?
Are you leaving?

211
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,319
我也不是很确定
I am not exactly sure.

212
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,419
我错过了什么?
What'd I miss?

213
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,989
问Miles吧
Ask Miles.

214
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,279
谢谢
Thank you.

215
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,119
哇
Wow.

216
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,439
很高兴见到你 Miles
It's good to see you, too, Miles.

217
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,149
Sawyer让你回来打包 是吧?
Sawyer sent you packing, huh?

218
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,579
我也想跟他走
I thought about going after him, too.

219
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,299
但是 呃 我知道 我要是不回来
But, um, I knew he'd just end up berating me

220
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,059
他会一直骂我
until I turned around and came back.

221
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,029
发生了很多事情吧?
That pretty much what happened?

222
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,549
很多
Pretty much.

223
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:00,759
呃...
Well...

224
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,839
欢迎归队
Welcome back to the circus.

225
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,179
- 这里发生了什么事?  - 呃 我想下...
- What's going on in here?  - Well, let's see...

226
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,429
噢 那个澳大利亚小妞回来了
Oh, that Australian chick's back.

227
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:09,609
等下 什么?
Wait. What?

228
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,899
你知道的 那个... 那个金发的... 有过孩子的小妞
You know, the... the blonde... one that had the baby.

229
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,129
是Claire?
Claire?

230
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,319
对的 Claire
Right. Claire.

231
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,819
她几个小时前刚回来的
She just strolled in here a couple hours ago,

232
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,459
举止怪异
acting all weird.

233
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,869
不过 还是很辣
Still hot, though.

234
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,509
Miles 她在哪?
Miles, where is she?

235
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,589
她在哪?
Where is she?

236
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,479
你好 Sayid
Hello, Sayid.

237
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,849
你为什么要这么做?
Now why'd you go and do that?

238
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,689
你想拿回它?
You want it back?

239
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,699
拿着 我不吃人
Take it. I won't bite.

240
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,259
你是什么东西?
What are you?

241
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,669
呃 Sayid 你好像有所耳闻
Well, Sayid, you seem to have some idea about that,

242
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,109
所以连招呼都不打
considering that you stabbed me in the chest

243
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,069
就直接刺我胸口
without even saying hello.

244
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,599
他们跟你说了什么?
What did they tell you?

245
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,499
他们说你是恶魔的化身
They said you were evil incarnate.

246
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,669
我为你感到悲哀
I feel sorry for you.

247
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,609
为什么?
Why?

248
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:35,909
Dogen... 让你来这儿的那个人...
Dogen... the man who sent you out here...

249
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,819
知道你根本杀不了我
knew that you had no chance of killing me.

250
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,809
而且他认为 你一旦动手 我就会杀了你
And he believed that I would kill you if you tried.

251
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,309
而且这不是他第一次
And this wasn't the first time that

252
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,879
借刀杀人 对吧?
he tried to get someone else to do it for him, was it?

253
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,529
嗯
No.

254
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,399
那你这么容易就信他的话 真悲哀
Then shame on you for being talked into it so easily.

255
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,829
那你想让我信你什么?
And what is it you are trying to talk me into?

256
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:00,819
什么?
Sorry?

257
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,539
你没杀我
You haven't killed me.

258
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,219
很明显 你有目的
Clearly, there's something you want.

259
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,219
我只想让你带个口信儿 仅此而已
I just want you to deliver a message, that's all.

260
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,049
你怎么不让Claire传话?
Then why didn't you just have Claire deliver it?

261
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,679
因为你才有说服力
Because it would mean a lot more coming from you.

262
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,459
Sayid 如果你能帮我的话...
Sayid, if you'll do this for me...

263
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,338
要是我告诉你 你能得到一切你想要的东西呢?
What if I told you that you could have anything you wanted?

264
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:31,118
要是我告诉你 你能得到这世上任何东西呢?
What if I said you could have anything in the entire world?

265
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:37,068
那我就会说 我唯一想要的人
I would tell you that the only thing I ever wanted

266
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,908
死在了我怀里
died in my arms.

267
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:44,658
我永远都见不到她了
And I'll never see it again.

268
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,528
但要是你能呢?
But what if you could?

269
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:07,778
哦...
Uh...

270
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,498
出了点小意外
We had an unfortunate incident

271
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,018
被飞去来器打成这样的
involving a boomerang.

272
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,498
是我的错
My apologies.

273
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,448
孩子们什么时候睡的?
Oh, what time did the kids go to bed?

274
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,678
大概两小时前
About two hours ago.

275
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,298
你怎么跟他们说的?
And what did you tell them?

276
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:30,988
爸爸出了点意外
Daddy had an accident,

277
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,198
但他不会有事的
but that he's going to be fine.

278
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,508
他还在术后恢复中 但是...
He's still recovering from surgery, but...

279
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:40,968
他现在醒了
he's awake now.

280
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,098
他告诉你借贷的事了?
Did he tell you about the loan?

281
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,328
听着 我有钱
Look, I have money.

282
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,188
不
No.

283
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,918
这是Omer的过错
This is Omer's responsibility.

284
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,338
他得自己承担责任
He brought this on himself.

285
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,398
你为什么不想跟我在一起?
Why didn't you want to be with me?

286
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:12,858
Sayid 你把我的照片一直带在身上
You carry my picture around with you, Sayid.

287
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,798
你要是关心我
If you care about me,

288
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,888
为什么还把我推向你哥哥?
why did you push me towards your brother?

289
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:30,428
在过去的12年里
For the last 12 years,

290
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,378
我一直试着洗净双手...
I've been trying to wash my hands...

291
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,338
洗净我做过的丑事
of all the horrible things I've done.

292
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:41,628
我不能跟你在一起...
I can't be with you...

293
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,978
因为我不配得到你
because I don't deserve you.

294
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:09,588
发生了什么事?
What happened?

295
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,958
丛林里有个男人...
There is a man in the jungle...

296
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,318
在往南大约一英里的
about a mile south of us,

297
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:18,878
围墙边上
by the outer wall.

298
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,098
他让我回来捎个口信
He sent me back here to give you a message.

299
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,888
他想让你们知道 Jacob已经死了
He wants you to know that Jacob is dead.

300
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,038
因为他死了
And because he's gone,

301
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,628
你们也没必要再待下去了
none of you have to stay here any longer.

302
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,838
你们自由了
You're free.

303
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,248
我碰到的这个人
The man that I met

304
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,678
马上就要永远地离开这个岛
is leaving the island forever.

305
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:40,698
想要跟他走的
And those of you who want to go with him

306
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,068
就离开寺庙 跟他一起走
should leave the temple and join him.

307
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,578
日落前 做出决定吧
You have until sundown to decide.

308
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,238
要是日落时 我们留下来呢?
What happens at sundown if we stay?

309
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:51,708
那就只有死路一条
You die.
