1
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:04,021
这样不是很好么?
Isn't this nice?

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:07,078
我有点...想休息了
I kind of... prefer breathing.

3
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,039
加油  你做得不错
Come on, you're doing great.

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,012
你知道  运动是会上瘾的
You know, exercise is addictive.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,019
喔...我能...
Wow...I can...

6
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:19,035
我知道为什么了
I can see why.

7
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,033
我想我需要减肥
Guess I need to drop a few pounds.

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,016
别对自己太严厉
Don't be so hard on yourself.

9
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:30,034
这不是马上能完成的事
It's not going to happen overnight.

10
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:35,014
有些人的新陈代谢是有点慢
Some people's metabolisms are just a little slower.

11
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,079
不是因为新陈代谢
It's not my metabolism.

12
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:43,072
我病了
I'm sick.

13
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:46,053
什么?
What?

14
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:50,008
怎么了?
What's wrong?

15
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:53,034
没什么
Never mind.

16
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,087
Hurley

17
00:00:56,036 --> 00:01:00,000
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

18
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:04,072
好吧
Okay.

19
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:09,098
但是...这不是什么好事情
But...it's bad.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,051
当我们刚坠机时
When we first crashed here,

21
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,091
我想这也不是太坏
I thought this isn't all bad.

22
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,028
我可以吃芒果减肥
It's like the all-mango diet.

23
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:25,059
我并没有刻意去这么做
I wasn't turning any heads or nothing,

24
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:29,040
但我确实是瘦了几圈
but I did drop a couple belt sizes.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,066
然后我们找到了这个舱子
Then we found this hatch,

26
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,097
里面全是食物...
and it was full of food...

27
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:36,067
大堆的食物
tons of food.

28
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,029
我想把它们都扔掉  但是...
I tried giving it all away, but...

29
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:45,069
我还是留了点给我自己
I guess I kinda kept some of it for myself.

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,050
我希望我能把它们处理掉
Wish I could just get rid of it.

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,081
那就处理掉它们
Then get rid of it.

32
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,087
你想改变自我么?
You want to change?

33
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:08,072
那就改变吧
Then change.

34
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,049
感觉怎样?
How do you feel?

35
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:45,038
我感到自由了
Oh! I feel free.

36
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:05,013
有人找到了些东西
They found something.

37
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:07,034
快来
Come on!

38
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,048
快点  伙计们
Hurry, guys.

39
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:26,086
意大利饭  不错
Risotto. Nice.

40
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:29,007
不
No.

41
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,030
这些是哪儿来的?
Where did this come from?

42
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,092
Locke说他被门关在舱子里了
Locke said doors trapped him in the hatch.

43
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,040
也许就是因为这个
Maybe it was because of this,

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,003
就没人能看到这些是谁扔下的了
so no one would see who dropped it.

45
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,035
有谁昨晚看见过飞机了?
Any of you guys see a plane last night?

46
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,026
我看见了
Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo.

47
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,075
刚刚还想不说的
I just decided not to tell.

48
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,071
-还给我 伙计 拜托  -伙计  是我先看到的
-Hey, put that back, man. Come on.  -Oh, man, I saw it first.

49
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,056
你看到时我已经把它放我盒子里了
 You saw me take those.You saw me put those in my box.

50
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:52,018
-不  把我的东西还我  -别冲动
-No. Gimme my stuff!  -Hold on, take it easy!

51
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,020
你们就像蝗虫一样  我们讲点次序怎样?
You're like locusts. How about a little order?

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,015
我们干吗不找个值得信任的人来看管这些呢?
Shouldn't we let someone trustworthy do this?

53
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,053
比如说你 婴儿绑票犯是么?
Like you, babynapper?

54
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:01,016
不  比如说Hurley  Hurley可以
No. Like Hurley. Why not Hurley?

55
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,054
他以前作过  现在可以再作
He's　done it before, he could do it again.

56
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:05,096
不  想也别想
No! No way!

57
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,086
我不要  不  我不干了
Not me! No! Not again! No.

58
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,027
嘿  嘿  伙计们 伙计们
OK, hey, hey, guys, guys.

59
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,022
要不不要找人管了吧?
How about no one's in charge, OK?

60
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:14,031
我确定大家都能做到只拿需要的那部分的
I'm sure everyone can manage to just take what they need.

61
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,026
好建议
Great plan, Moonbeam.

62
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:19,083
在那之后我们就能唱着歌来玩信任游戏了
After that, we can sing Kumbaya and do trust falls.

63
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,086
-放那里    -放这里
-put them in there.   -pull this over here.

64
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,086
这样太粗鲁了
...savages about it.

65
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:27,026
我们怎么样都可以
We can do it any way you want.

没什么
Nothing.

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,099
你在这儿找谁?

没找谁
No one.

73
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,077
你好像在找什么人

-我在找你...   -我有点...

不想谈这个
don't wanna talk about it.

76
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:41,012
噢  好的
Sure. OK.

77
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,046
很奇怪  不是么?
Pretty weird, huh?

78
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,069
你说这个岛不想让你减肥...
You said the island won't let you lose weight,

79
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,005
你毁了你的储备  然后...
you destroy your stash, then bang...

80
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:55,090
天上掉下了更多的食物
More food falls from the sky.

81
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,097
那又怎样
How about that?

82
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:02,019
我很为你自豪
I'm proud of you.

83
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,078
为什么?
Proud of me for what?

84
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:07,074
没有兴奋异常
Not freaking out.

85
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:16,070
减肥成果怎样  Hugo?
How's the diet coming, Hugo?

00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,062
很不错
It's OK.

87
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,095
我中午吃了沙拉和鸡胸
I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.

00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,028
很好
That's great.

我保证会越来越容易的
It gets easier. I promise.

90
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:33,002
我听说你去看你妈妈了?
So, I heard you had a visit with your mom.

91
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,068
怎么样了?
How did that go?

92
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,065
很不错
It was good.

93
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:38,010
你不生她气了吧?
You're not still mad at her, then?

94
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,050
不了  我知道她带我来这儿是有原因的
Nah.　I know she put me in here for a reason.

95
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,054
什么原因?
What reason was that?

96
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,099
意外事故
The accident.

97
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,048
你今天想谈谈这个么?
You wanna talk about that today?

98
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,013
一定要说么?
Do we have to?

99
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,028
Hugo  你在这儿快两个月了
Hugo, you've been in here almost two months now.

100
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:02,085
差不多可以做点不情愿做的事了吧?
Don't you think it's time to start getting our hands dirty? Hm?

101
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:07,015
好吧  我们来谈谈...
OK, why don't we talk about

102
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,082
我给你布置的家庭作业吧?
the little homework assignment that I gave you?

103
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,007
家庭作业我从来都做不好
I was never really good at homework.

104
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,087
你记得你应该做什么吗?
Remember what you were supposed to do?

105
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:18,080
把你喜欢做的事列一张表
Just make a list of things that you like about yourself?

106
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,027
没人这么做过
Nobody else did it.

107
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,050
没人?  指谁?
Nobody else? Meaning?

108
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,077
Dave没这么做过
Well, Dave didn't do it.

109
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:26,084
他说这么做很蠢
He said it was a stupid idea.

110
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,003
你知道  我不是Dave的医生
Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor,

111
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:35,020
但我们谈过了他对你的影响是消极的
but we have talked about how he can be a very negative influence.

112
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,060
Dave是这儿最正常的人了
Dave's the most normal person in this place, man.

113
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,006
但他不想你改变  不是么?
But he doesn't want you to change, does he?

114
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,062
快  把球给我
Come on, give me the ball.

00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,057
把球给我
Give me the ball!

116
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,097
伙计  伙计

我没人防守  这儿  这儿
I'm open! Dude! Dude!

118
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,094
把球给我
Give me the ball!

119
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,096
这叫运球
It's called "dribbling" not "drooling!"

120
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,054
叫运球
"Dribbling!"

121
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,061
投篮  快

122

投篮
Shoot it!

什么...哦  好高的命中率
What? High percentage shot.

124
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,072
不错的选择
Excellent choice.

125
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,048
-投篮!    -你想一起来么  伙计?  来吧
-Shoot!    -Want in the game? Go for it.

126
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:07,078
我想他们不会介意的
Something tells me no one'll care.

127
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,082
你怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

128
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,061
没什么
Nothing.

129
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:19,037
伙计  伙计  别摇了
Dude! Dude, give up the rock!

130
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:25,008
好极了  把球传给场外的人
Fantastic. Give it to the guy who's not even in the game!

131
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,022
嘿  伙计  该吃墨西哥卷了
Hey, it's Taco Night, dude.

132
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:30,020
别管什么规矩了
Let's blow this pop stand.

133
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,008
怎么了?
What?

134
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,010
Brooks说...
Brooks said you're,

135
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,025
你对我影响不好
like, negative.

136
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,050
是么
Well, duh!

137
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,042
那么你是不想和我做朋友了?
So, what, you don't wanna hang out with me any more?

138
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,033
不  我不知道  只是...
No, I don't know, it's...

139
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,007
你这么相信那个骗子么  伙计?
That quack getting inside your head?

140
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,066
别听他的
Do not let him.

141
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:47,029
你还要考虑更重要的事
You got much more important things to think about.

142
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,069
是什么?
Like what?

143
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,084
就像吃软贝还是硬贝
Like, hard or soft shell, baby?

144
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,030
鸡肉还是虾肉
Chicken or shrimp?

145
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,018
酸乳酪还是热沙司
Sour cream or hot sauce?

146
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,056
恩  我想我能吃
Yeah, I guess I could eat.

147
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,007
是啊  我也这么想
Yeah, I thought so.

148
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,079
吃墨西哥卷去吧  朋友
Noche de Tacos, amigo.

149
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:13,068
很好  动动另一只看?
Good. Now, can you do the other one?

150
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:23,083
没X光  我只能尽力猜了
Without an X-ray, you'll have to do with my best guess.

151
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,004
抱歉
Sorry.

152
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:29,098
能撑住么?
How you holding up?

153
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:32,064
就看Jack怎么猜了
Depends on Jack's best guess.

154
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,053
有点小骨折
There's a small fracture,

155
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,051
很微小的一点
probably hairline.

156
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,000
这样就能在我给你固定前减退肿大了
This will reduce the swelling until I get a splint.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,022
我要多久才能走?
How long until I can walk on it?

158
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:43,025
你得躺上几个星期
Keep off it a couple of weeks.

159
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,022
在营地那儿有个轮椅...
There's a wheelchair back at camp...

160
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,042
不要
No.

161
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,078
我不需要轮椅
I don't need a wheelchair.

162
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:52,097
我们走回海滩时在机身上弄了两块板
We took a pair of crutches from the fuselage when we moved down the beach.

163
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,039
好的
OK.

164
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,027
马上回来
I'll be back in a while.

165
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,037
他可以逃走的
He could've escaped.

166
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,059
什么?
Sorry?

167
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:05,083
Henry

168
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,002
在门落下的时候
During the lockdown.

169
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,016
我受伤了
I was hurt

170
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,088
他可以逃走的...
He could have escaped...

171
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,040
但是他...他回来帮我了
But he came back to help me.

172
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
他为什么那么做?
Why would he do that?

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,080
他不是回来帮你的  John
He didn't come back to help you, John

174
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,093
他回来是他认为他的故事完美无瑕
He came back because he thought his story was gonna check out.

175
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:30,050
他已经死了
He was dead already.

176
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,044
四个月前
Four months ago,

177
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,004
我是救援队中的一个
I was part of the search party.

178
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:41,042
Henry Gale摔在热气球外面  脖子断了
Henry Gale was hanging out of the basket, neck broken.

179
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:44,054
就是说你看到他时他已经死了
So he was already dead?

180
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,085
是的
Yes.

181
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:49,011
然后你埋了他  做了个墓碑
And then you buried him and left the grave marker?

182
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,038
是的
Yes.

183
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:56,033
你那么做前应该仔细看看他的皮夹
You really should have checked his wallet before you did that

184
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:01,093
我觉得Henry Gale没纸来写自己的想法
I assume Henry Gale did not have any paper on which to compose his thoughts,

185
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:04,011
所以他得临时找纸
so he had to improvise.

186
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:07,080
能写的地方不多
There wasn't much space for that.

187
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,068
Jennifer...

188
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:12,003
你是对的
Well, you were right.

189
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,040
横跨太平洋不是一件容易的事
Crossing the　Pacific isn't easy.

190
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,084
我欠你一瓶啤酒
I owe you a beer.

191
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:20,075
我要徒步去找海滩  在那儿生火求援
I'm hiking to one of the beaches to start a signal fire,

192
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:24,088
但是如果你看到了这段话  那表示我没有成功
but if you're reading this,I guess I didn't make it.

193
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:27,035
我很抱歉  我爱你  Jenny
I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny.

194
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:32,002
永远爱你
Always have, always will.

195
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,003
你的Henry
Yours, Henry.

196
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,047
那么告诉我...
So tell me...

197
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:45,033
Henry Gale断了脖子还能给他妻子写东西么?
how did Henry Gale write a note to his wife with a broken neck?

198
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,054
不是我
It wasn't me.

199
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,082
不是我杀的
I didn't kill him.

200
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,078
你不明白...
You don't understand...

201
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,012
你怎么知道他妻子的名字? 你拷问过他?
How did you know his wife's name?  Did you interrogate him?

202
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:56,032
拜托  听我说
Please...just listen...

203
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:59,099
-拜托  我只是一个...  -你们有多少人?
-Please  I'm just a...  -How many of you are there?

204
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,056
如果我和你说了  我会被他整得很惨的
If I tell you about them, you have no idea what he'll do.

205
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:05,012
他?
He?

206
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,091
你是说他们的头儿?
You mean their leader.

207
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,058
有胡子的那个?
The guy with the beard.

208
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:11,058
他?  没有他
Him? He's no one.

209
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,027
没这个人
Nothing!

210
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:13,078
你们的人在哪儿?
Where are your people?

211
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:15,051
-我不能...   -你们有多少人?
-I can't...   -How many of you are there?

212
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:19,036
-你不明白    -你要明白
-You don't understand!    -Understand this!

213
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:22,047
只给你三秒钟时间
Hey.You have three seconds to answer my question.

214
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
你们有多少人?
How many of you are there?

215
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,012
-1  -他会杀了我
-One.  -He'll kill me!

216
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,037
我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

217
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,044
-2  -Sayid
-Two.  -Sayid!

218
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,061
你不能这么做
You can't do this!

219
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,075
我不是个坏人
I am not a bad person!

220
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:38,016
你到底怎么了?
What the hell's wrong with you?

221
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,088
怎么了?  我听到枪声
What's going on? I heard a shot!

222
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:40,090
怎么了?
What happened?

223
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,076
他是个骗子
He's a liar.

224
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:44,094
没事  带他离开这儿
It's fine. Just get him out of here.

225
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:47,031
Jack

226
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:51,014
Jack?

227
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,049
Jack!

228
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:57,068
我处理好了  John
I've got it covered, John.

229
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,066
谢谢

230
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,022
闭嘴
Shut up.

231
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:22,058
我看见你在做东西
I noticed you were building something.

232
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:27,059
我想你用得着这个
I thought maybe you could use this, for whatever it is.

233
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,003
你很关心人  Charlie
That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie

234
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,092
帮忙一起干吧?
Why don't you help me?

235
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:41,093
你在做什么?
What are you making?

00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,019
抓住那头
Hold that end.

237
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,016
做咖啡馆么?
Is it a Starbucks?

238
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,094
帮我扛下那些木头
Help me carry one of those logs, please.

239
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:59,082

Are you gonna tell me?

240
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:04,084
还不是时候
Not right now.

241
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,091
你不在这的
You're not here!

穿着浴衣的人

手上拿着一个椰子

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,028
只看见一只北极熊拿着芒果站在滚筒上
I saw a polar bear on rollerblades with a mango.

250

我什么也没看到
I did not see anything either.

251
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:11,014
恩  我也没有
Yeah, me neither.

252
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,031
4  18  15

253
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,077
-哦  伙计     -16 23 42
-Aw, dude.     -16, 23, 42

254
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:22,025
好卑鄙  Leonard
Pretty sneaky, Leonard.

255
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:28,044
你在用你的那些数字装疯卖傻是么  伙计?
Using those magic numbers of yours as a psych-out, aren't you, man?

256
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,031
哦  对了  你在装聋作哑
Oh, yeah, that's right. You just play dumb.

257
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,044
我对你的念叨很感兴趣  伙计
I'm onto your juju, man.

258
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:34,094
那些只是数字  伙计
They're just numbers, dude.

259
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,055
那是什么?
What the hell is that?

260
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,070
我的下午点心
It's my mid-afternoon snack.

261
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,007
伙计  是芹菜  芹菜可不是点心
Dude, that's celery. Celery is not a snack.

262
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:47,014
Leonard有饼干  你能拿一块
Leonard's got graham crackers. You should snag one.

263
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:49,009
他不会发现的
He won't notice.

264
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,086
他能怎么做  叫你"23"?
What's he gonna do? Call you a "23"?

265

4 8 15 16  
4 8 15 16 Hike!

别吃这些镇定剂
Don't take the horse tranquilizer.

271
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,094
你说什么  离开这儿?
What do you mean, "get outta here?"

272
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,026

Me and you. ASAP.

274
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,041
他们看你看得很紧  伙计  我们得分头行动
They're getting to you, dude. We gotta split.

275
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,066
-Brooks医生说...  -Brooks医生不在乎你  伙计
-Dr.Brooks says...  -Dr.Brooks does not care about you, man.

276
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:27,051
他就是那个给你药的人
He's the one prescribing that crap.

277
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,074
这到底是什么药?
What the hell is it anyway?

278
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,053
科隆纳泽潘
Clonazepam.

279
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:36,024
Hugo? 药有问题么?

00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:39,029
不  呃...我和Dave在...

非常好
Never been saner.

287
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,082
我要拍几张照片放在公告板上
I'm taking pictures for the bulletin board.

288
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,022
就只有你们两个没拍了
I've got everyone except you two.

289
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,091
你们不介意吧?
Would you guys mind?

290
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:02,026
好的
OK.

291
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,042
好的
OK.

292
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,015
你们可以靠近一点
Why don't you get a little closer together?

293
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,057
要我们装出很高兴的表情么?
Are you gonna make us look at the ducky, too?

294
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:12,020
说"茄子"
Say cheese!

295
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,067
-"茄子"     -"茄子"
-Cheese!    -Queso!

296
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,043
很好
Great.

297
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,048
那么你吃药要水么?
OK, you...you need a little water with that?

298
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,066
不用  我可以
Nope. I'm good.

299
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,032
那好
OK. Well, fine.

300
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:24,037

革命已经开始了  伙计
The revolution has begun, man.

305
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:41,091
时机合适的时候  我们就走
Lay low. When the time is right, we fly.

306
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:46,030
(巧克力奶油饼)

307
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:54,073
你得用扭的...
You gotta twist it.

308
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:59,001
才能弄到奶油  硬拉只会得不偿失
To get the frosting. Pulling it'll only break your cookie.

309
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:03,023
我知道了不能一开始就成为行家
Well, that's what I get for not going to the expert in the first place.

310
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:06,071

I was kind of looking for something.

312

算了吧  买卖结束了
Forget it. I'm done trading.

313

我的东西足够开一家连锁超市了
I got enough food now to open a chain of mini-marts.

嘿  你想Sayid需要一份工作么?
Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?

我希望你帮个忙
I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor.

希望你还记得我帮你找过树蛙...
Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog...

318
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,023
被你捏死的那只
which you killed?

吃了药后就能...
It's so you can calm down

327

不看...看不见...
or for when you're seeing things...

328
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:51,050
那些...不应该存在的东西
that aren't supposed to be there.

你看见什么了?
What stuff are you seeing?

330
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,034
我不知道...
I don't know,

331
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:01,041
可能是个穿浴衣的秃子
maybe, like, a bald guy in a bathrobe.

332
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:05,031
你是说那个人?

他打了你了  是么?
So he just attacked you, huh?

Try to contain yourself, Freckles.

你看起来是像被人踢了屁股
You look like you got your ass kicked

354
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,072
为什么你不开始一段冒险呢?

355
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:21,047
我想Timmy在那条路上掉到井里了
I think Timmy fell down a well over that way.

356
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:25,045
认真点  他怎么...
Seriously, though, why'd he...

毫无原因
For no reason at all?

走路当心点
But steer clear.

364
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:40,074
那人是个疯子
The man is crazy.

365
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,074
Hurley?

366
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,001

还裸着身子向人扔泥巴

Dave不是你的朋友  Hugo
Dave isn't your friend, Hugo...

436
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:35,068

00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:30,043
我不能这么做
I don't think I can do this.

468
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,006
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,040
抱歉?
Sorry?

470
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,057
什么  你在开玩笑么?
What, are you kidding me?

471
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:37,031
你不是真的
You're not real.

472
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:40,031
你帮我逃走帮我拿奶酪三明治是因为...
You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because...

473
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,018
我想要三明治
I want cheeseburgers.

474
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,083
你吃了那些药了么  伙计?
Did you take those pills, man?

475
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,098
没有  我只是不想走
No, man, I'm just not coming.

476
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:50,003
听着  你不想我好  你不想我转变
Look, you don't want me to get better, you don't want me to change.

477
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:52,074
你不需要转变  伙计
You don't need to change, man

478
00:30:52,074 --> 00:30:54,031
你很好  你很棒
You are fine. You are great.

479
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:57,004
不 我不好
No, I'm not.

480
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:00,072
你想让我永远这么胖
You just want me to stay fat.

481
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,078
你不想我好
You don't want me to get better.

482
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:04,036
你不在乎我吃到死
You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death.

483
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,049
别这么干  伙计
Do not do this, man.

484
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:09,052
如果你现在不和我走
If you don't come with me right now,

485
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:11,036
你永远
you will never

486
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,099
也走不了了
get outta here.

487
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:20,092
再见  Dave
Bye, Dave.

488
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:44,051
你发现我的拖鞋  意外么?
You wouldn't happen to have my slipper, would you?

489
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:55,046
谢谢
Thank you.

490
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:58,007
噢  伙计
Oh, man!

491
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:02,003
你把花生酱倒在上面了
You got peanut butter on it.

492
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:04,070
好了  听着...
OK, look,

493
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,023
我知道你现在有点想不通
I know you're freaking out right now,

494
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:09,073
我非常非常抱歉  但是...
and I'm sorry, but...

495
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:13,023
这是黎明前的黑暗
it's gonna get a little worse before it gets better.

496
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:14,009
黑暗?
Worse?

497
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,062
是的...
Yeah.

498
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,047
有点
Kinda.

499
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:20,010
你准备好了么  伙计?
You ready, dude?

500
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:27,033
你记得那晚你看着我关上窗么?
You remember that night you closed that window on me?

501
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,055
你记得你之后干了什么吗?
Remember what you did after that night?

502
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:32,003
是的
Yeah.

503
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:35,021
我了解到你是虚构的
I realized you were imaginary.

504
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,015
而且...
And...

505
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:41,031
那是个转折点
that was a breakthrough.

506
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:42,068
过了不久
And a little while later,

507
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,086
Brooks让我出来了
Brooks let me out,

508
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,056
我回家和我妈住在一起
and I went home to live with my mom,

509
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:48,088
我在Cluck那儿找了份工作
and I got my job at Mr. Cluck's back,

510
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:49,080
然后我好了起来
and I got better.

511
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,007
好的  很好  非常好
OK. Good. Great. Yeah.

512
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:53,049
除了...
Except,

513
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:56,079
我和你说...呃...
see, here's the thing. Uh...

514
00:32:57,068 --> 00:33:01,061
那些事都没发生过
None of that ever happened.

515
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:02,092
什么?
What?

516
00:33:02,092 --> 00:33:05,097
你还在圣罗萨  伙计
You're still at Santa Rosa, man.

517
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:10,064
你没离开过医院
You never left the hospital.

518
00:33:14,011 --> 00:33:16,036
那是...
That's...

519
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,087
-不可能的     -我知道这很难接受
-That's not possible.     -It's hard, I know.

520
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:22,028
但是  我是说  全部这些
But, I mean, all this?

521
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:24,012
你  我
You? Me?

522
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:25,059
这个岛
This island?

523
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:28,042
花生酱...这全是假的
That peanut butter? None of it's real, man.

524
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,069
一切都没发生过
None of it's happening.

525
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:33,068
全是你想出来的  伙计
It's all in your head, my friend.

526
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:37,004
在你关上那窗子之后  你的脑子就被套上了枷锁
The second you closed that window, your brain popped a gasket.

527
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,002
你又重新昏迷了
You went back into your coma thing,

528
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:42,002
也就是此时此刻的你
and that's where you are right this very second.

529
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,095
在爱达荷州
In your own private Idaho

530
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:47,001
在圣罗萨医院
inside Santa Rosa.

531
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,067
不
No.

532
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,000
我有...
I had...

533
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,052
我妈妈...
My mom...

534
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:53,076
我的朋友Johnny...
My friend Johnny...

535
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:55,099
我赢了六合彩
I won the lottery.

536
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,081
真不错  伙计
Awesome, dude.

537
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,072
你用什么号码赢的?
What numbers did you play?

538
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,079
Leonard'的数字  是么?
Leonard's numbers, right?

539
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,017
从医院里听来的?  多么凑巧啊  你...
From the hospital? What a coincidence.

540
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:12,063
还在哪儿看到这些数字了?
You seen them around anywhere else?

541
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,072
-舱门上     -答对了
-The hatch.     -Bingo!

542
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:16,016
舱门上
The hatch.

543
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:18,015
你每隔108分钟就得按按键
With the button that you gotta push every 108 minutes

544
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,064
不然就是世界末日了
or the world ends.

545
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:22,007
噢噢噢  而且...
Oh, oh, oh, and

546
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:24,013
你要按哪些数字?
what's the code for the button?

547
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,096
噢  对了
Oh, yeah.

548
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:29,027
那些数字
The numbers.

549
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:33,011
但是我好多了
But I got better.

550
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:35,007
变了?
Changed?

551
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,004
你在说笑么?  看看你自己
Are you kidding? Take a look at yourself.

552
00:34:37,004 --> 00:34:39,041
你在这个荒芜的岛上呆了两个多月了
You've been on a deserted island for over two months

553
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,009
你连10磅都没减下来
and you haven't dropped ten pounds.

554
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:42,081
这可能么  伙计?
How is that even possible, man?

555
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:45,012
我刚刚毁了我的储藏
I just destroyed my stash.

556
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:47,029
我一直在锻炼  Libby说那不是马上能完成的事
And I've been exercising. Libby says it won't...

557
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:48,073
对了对了  Libby
Right, Libby.

558
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:52,031
那个魔法般从岛的另一边出现的美丽金发小妞
The mega-cute blonde chick who magically appeared from the other side of the island.

559
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:53,064
噢  对
Oh, yeah,

560
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:55,053
她恰巧这么性感...
and who just happens to have the hots

561
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:59,039
就为了你
for you?

562
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:04,060
来吧  伙计  我们走走
Come on, man. Let's take a walk.

563
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:09,065
那么这些都是我想出来的?
So this is all in my brain?

564
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,083
每块石头  每棵树
Every rock. Every tree.

565
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,055
每只树蛙
Every tree frog.

566
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:14,065
甚至是我
Even me.

567
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:16,096
真的我  那个他们告诉你是虚构的...
The real me, the one they told you was imaginary?

568
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,079
他已经跳出窗外了  伙计
He went out that window, man.

569
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,020
现在他大概在一堆辣妹之间享受呢
Right now, he's probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick.

570
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,008
你不同  你是真的
Unlike me, who's really you,

571
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:28,029
你有很重要的事要做
who's got more important things to do.

572
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,056
那么你是我想出来的
So I'm making you up?

573
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,037
可以这么说
Well, sorta.

574
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:33,096
我是你潜意识的一部分  伙计
I'm part of your subconscious, man.

575
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:37,061
这个岛上的所有人都是
All the people on this island are.

576
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:40,064
你是我哪一部分?
What part of me are you?

577
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:45,079
我是你想醒来的那部分  伙计
I'm the part of you that wants to wake up, man.

578
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:51,058
跟我来
Follow me.

579
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:56,097
就这了  伙计
This is it, dude.

580
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,029
这?
It?

581
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:00,040
终结的地方
The big finale.

582
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,039
你所有问题的答案
The answer to all your problems.

583
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,039
使你醒来的一个方法
A way for you to wake up,

584
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,074
从这里摆脱出去
snap out of it.

585
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,015
我不想自杀
I don't wanna kill myself.

586
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,097
谁说了是自杀了  伙计?
Who said anything about killing yourself, man?

587
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:19,090
这会使你回到你的生活
This is gonna bring you back to life.

588
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:23,086
你离开这里的唯一方法
The only way for you to bust out

589
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,056
就是告诉你自己
is to tell your mind

590
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:29,068
你不相信这的一切
that you don't believe any of this.

591
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:32,011
那么...
So...

592
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,098
如果我...
if I...

593
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,017
这些全都结束了?
All this will be gone?

594
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:40,005
我会醒来?
I'll just wake up?

595
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:42,093
是的
That's right.

596
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:45,072
当你醒来的时候
And when you do wake up,

597
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,070
来找我吧
come find me.

598
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,045
我肯定我想死你了
I'm sure I miss you.

599
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:56,017
在另一个世界见吧  Hurley
See you in another life, Hurley.

600
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,051
Dave

601
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,034
Jack还没回来么?
Jack not back yet?

602
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,028
没有
Nope

603
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,081
他会和海滩上每个人说我们抓了他们中的一个
He's telling everyone at the beach that we've got one of 'em.

604
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,098
我想大家会有很多问题要问我们这位房客的
Something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest.

605
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:28,040
我想和他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

606
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,061
我想这不在今天的日程之上
I don't think that's on today's program.

607
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:36,030
尊敬的Ana Lucia 我不在乎你是怎么想的
Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia, but I don't care what you think.

608
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,097
就5分钟
Five minutes.

609
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:44,090
我就和他说5分钟
I earned five minutes with him.

610
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,038
你叫什么?
What's your name?

611
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,093
你的真名
Your real name.

612
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:11,062
你为什么不...
Why don't you

613
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:15,077
继续叫我Henry?
just keep calling me Henry?

614
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:19,023
我已经习惯这么叫了
I've gotten used to it.

615
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,026
你是故意被抓的么?
Did you get caught on purpose?

616
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:27,072
你和你们的人在这儿
You and your people have been here

617
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,021
呆了多久 只有上帝知道 然后你被一只网抓了...
for God knows how long, and you got caught in a net...

618
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,076
上帝不知道
God doesn't know.

619
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:35,013
什么?
Excuse me?

620
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:41,042
上帝不知道我们在这儿呆了多久了  John
God doesn't know how long we've been here, John.

621
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:46,022
他像世界其他地方的人一样也看不到这个岛
He can't see this island any betterthan the rest of the world can.

622
