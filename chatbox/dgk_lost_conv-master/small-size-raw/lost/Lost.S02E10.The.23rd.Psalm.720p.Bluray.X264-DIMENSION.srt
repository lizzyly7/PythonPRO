3
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,024
它从哪来的?
Where's it come from?

4
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,029
从里边的地图上看  是尼日利亚
Based on the maps, Nigeria.

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:23,027
飞机上有人么?
Anyone on board?

00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,086
有两个穿着像牧师的人

7
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,082
牧师?
Priests?

8
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:29,067
实际上是伪装后的毒贩子

9
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:33,067
飞机上全是海洛因
The plane was loaded with heroin.

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:43,049
你是谁?

11
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,082
我是Micheal

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,035

你们都给我离开

19
00:01:55,083 --> 00:02:00,098
住手   别带走孩子了

20
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:04,076
抓住那个老人

35
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,082
你不再需要那东西了
You won't need that anymore.

36
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,092
回去了
Back.

37
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:33,028
回去了  回去了
Back we go, back we go.

38
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,012
你在写什么?
What are you writing?

39
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:06,091

谢谢
Thanks.

43
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,033
你叫Eko  是么?
So, you're Eko, huh?

44
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,035
是的
Yes.

45
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:24,002
我叫Claire  他是Aaron.
Claire. And this is Aaron.

46
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:27,061
Aaron?  是圣经里摩西的兄弟?
Aaron? The brother of Moses.

47
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,092
是啊  有点名不符实  是么?
That must've been tough to live up to.

48
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,018
大家会说
Everyone saying,

49
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,095
"为什么你不多像点你兄弟摩西?"
"Why can't you be more like your brother Moses?"

50
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:39,074
恩  我想是的
I'm sure it was.

51
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,000
你为什么给他起这个名字...
Why did you choose it? Aaron?

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,022
Aaron?

53
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:51,007
只是因为喜欢
I just liked it.

54
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:58,025
Aaron是个了不起的人
Aaron was a great man.

55
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:01,094
摩西有语言障碍
Moses had great difficulty speaking,

56
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:06,086
所以Aaron就成了他的嘴巴
so it was Aaron who spoke for him.

57
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:11,028
这么说你信教  是么?
So, you're religious, huh?

58
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,047
那你应该和Charlie谈谈
You should speak to Charlie.

59
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,041
他不承认他是信教的
He doesn't want to admit he's religious,

60
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:20,019
但他总是随身带着一个圣母玛利亚的小雕像
but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary.

61
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,006
小雕像?
Statue?

62
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:26,071
对  他说他是在岛上找到的
Yaah,he said he found it on the island.

63
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,064
很奇怪吧?
Weird, right?

64
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:33,031
我能看看吗?
May I see it?

65
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,001
他在哪里找到的?
Where did he find this?

66
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,049
他说他是在丛林里找到的
He said he found it in the jungle.

67
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,085
丛林里的哪儿?
Where in the jungle?

68
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:45,044
-我...我不知道  -快说哪里?
-I don't know.  -Where?

69
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,063
听着  这没什...只是个雕像
Why do you? It's just a statue.

70
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:52,010
只是个雕像?
Just a statue?

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,070
Charlie在哪?
Where is Charlie?

72
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,073
你是闯进去的还是闯出来的?
You breaking in or breaking out?

73
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:44,044
我以前很喜欢那种老的无声电影
I used to love those old silent movies

74
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:50,040
强盗把耳朵贴在保险柜边 然后打开密码锁
where the robbers would crack a lock with their ear pressed up against the safe.

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,056
他们偷的钱总是装在一个白色口袋里
The money they stole was always in a white bag

76
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,056
口袋上有个大大的美金符号
with a big dollar sign on it.

77
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:56,049
无声电影?
Silent movies, huh?

78
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,036
你没那么老吧  伙计
You're not that old, man.

79
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:00,052
我已经够老了
I'm old enough.

80
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,082
在设密码?
You setting the combination?

81
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:02,095
现在又来了一批人
With the new folks joining us,

82
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:06,014
我想我们最好限制一下枪的使用权
we better limit people's access to the guns.

83
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:10,044
不能谁为了一己之私就要给谁用
Can't have just anyone who wants one walk in and help themselves.

84
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:15,054
我猜你来这就是为了自己的私事吧  Michael
Which, I'm guessing,is why you're here, Michael.

85
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:21,090
他很聪明  很有魅力 但是当他生气的时候

86
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,072
他会折断你的胳膊  他很有品位

87
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:25,034
有礼貌并且很有风度 但是当他生气的时候

88
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,021
他会撕烂你的脸  他会给你买首饰

89
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,075
买昂贵的鞋子

90
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:30,078
嘿  Jin
Hey, Jin.

91
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:34,002
你喜欢Kinks乐队么?  Kinks?
Jin, do you like The Kinks? Kinks?

92
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,007
膝盖?
Keens?

93
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,012
不不  是Kinks乐队
No, the Kinks.

94
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:39,005
Kinds的最后一个字母变成"k" K-k-kink-kuh  K-kinks
With a "K" at the end. A kicking "K". "K", Kinks?

95
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,084
你不知道...
You don't...

96
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,063
一旦你被卷入  就不要想再脱身

97
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,069
所以当心点...

98
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,063
很不错的旋律  Jin
It's a good tune.

99
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,002
过来看看

100
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:51,019
谢谢你  Jin
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:55,007
我的嗓子确实很不错  不是吗
I do have a beautiful voice.

102
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,027
你在哪找到这个的?
Where did you find this?

103
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,065
-怎么了?  -你在哪找到的?
-What happened?  -Where did you find it?

104
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:06,010
在丛林里  我在丛林里找到的
I found it in the jungle.

105
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,082
带我去
Take me there.

106
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,024
这不关你的事
This is not your business.

107
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,033
你在哪儿找到的就带我去哪儿
Take me to where you found it.

108
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,025
好  没问题  对  就算去散散步
Fine. We'll go for a stroll.

109
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,038
那什么都没有
There's nothing there.

110
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,060
我们一早就去  好吗?
In the morning.

111
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,040
我们现在就去
We're going now.

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,090
好吧  我去和Claire说一声  好让她别误会
OK. Let me tell Claire, so she doesn't get the wrong idea.

113
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,006
在这儿等我  我去...我们一起去
Wait here. I...Tell her on your way.

114
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,072
弄点啤酒来  快去
Get us some beers. Go.

115
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:08,044
你在哪找到的?
Where did you find this?

116
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:12,021
这有关系么?
What does it matter?

117
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,043
另一个袋子里的也一样?
Same in the other bag?

118
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,015
是的
Yes.

119
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,044
5万
Fifty.

120
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:44,048
什么5万?
Fifty what?

121
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:50,007
你要我帮你的忙  我给你5万
50 is what I will pay you in exchange for the favour you are asking me to do.

122
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,030
帮忙?
A favour?

123
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,055
你有很多海洛因
You have a large quantity of heroin

124
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:57,055
但是这个国家既没有罂粟也没有毒品市场
in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale.

125
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,070
这些毒品在这儿毫无价值
Your drugs are of no value here,

126
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,048
所以你必须把它们运出去
so you must get them out.

127
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:04,038
但边境都有军队把守
The borders are all guarded by the military,

128
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,029
所以你只能空运
so you must fly.

129
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:08,059
但是你也知道
But as I am sure you are aware,

130
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:14,018
现在被允许飞行的私人飞机 要么是运输联合国救援物资的
the only private planes currently allowed into the air

131
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:17,004
要么就是基督教传教士的飞机
are either UN aid or the Catholic missionaries.

132
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:22,009
所以你来找我帮你的忙
And so you have come to me for a favour.

133
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:29,054
我会买你的毒品...5万块
I will buy your heroin.For fifty.

134
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:44,044
看来传言都是真的
It is true what they say about you.

135
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,044
怎么说?
And what is that?

136
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:50,014
你不是人
You have no soul.

137
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:59,032
不
No.

138
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,061
快滚
Go.

139
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,085
滚...
Go.

140
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,078
告诉你的朋友是我让你活下来的...
And tell your friends I let you live,

141
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:17,017
是Eko先生让你活下来的
that Mr.Eko let you live.

142
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,053
就等我一会  好吗?
Just give me a second.

143
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:35,020
嗨...Claire
Hi... Claire.

144
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,058
那个雕像怎么了?
What happened to the statue?

145
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,068
别装了  Charlie
Don't play stupid.

146
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:40,072
什么?
What?

147
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,059
这是什么?
What's this?

148
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,015
这是你小雕像里边的东西
Because this was in your little statue.

149
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,070
除非我弄错了
Unless I'm mistaken,

150
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,093
我好像记得你说过你曾经是一个瘾君子
I remember you saying you were a drug addict.

151
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:58,021
我不知道
I didn't know.

152
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:03,042
它被密封在这个雕像里边  我怎么会知道?
If it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know?

153
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:08,068
Claire  我没有吸毒
Claire? I'm not using.

154
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:11,024
你现在相信我了吧?
Look. Believe me now?

155
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:15,071
我不... 在乎
I don't care.

156
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:19,079
有人在等你
Someone's waiting for you.

157
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,085
会了么?
Got it?

158
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,069
会了
Got it.

159
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,072
好的
All right.

160
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:39,016
呼出半口气  慢慢的扣下扳机
Breath halfway out,and gently squeeze the trigger.

161
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:41,070
打...
Squeeze.

162
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,022
好
Good.

163
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:46,052
你从哪里学的这些?
How'd you learn all this stuff?

164
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,070
我爸爸曾经带我去打猎
My dad used to take me hunting.

165
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,009
打什么?
Hunting for what?

166
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,030
一般是鸟
Birds mostly.

167
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:57,034
当然了  鸟是不会还击的
Of course, birds don't shoot back.

168
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,015
是啊
Yeah.

169
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,071
我知道人们都在议论
People are talking,

170
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,097
认为我肯定会再去找Walt
thinking I'm gonna go running off after Walt.

171
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:06,044
有么? 我没听说过
If people are talking,I'm not hearing it.

172
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,080
但如果真是这样 我会说这不是一个明智之举
But if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan.

173
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,011
对  没错
Yeah, it's not.

174
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,033
这次来枪真的
Let's try one for real.

175
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,017
好样的
Bravo.

176
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,084
在Claire面前做得不错  伙计
Well done with Claire, mate.

177
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,006
你可给我惹了不少麻烦
You got me in a lot of trouble there,

178
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:44,065
多谢了啊  希望你开心
so thanks for that.I hope you're happy.

179
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:48,083
对了  你不会开心的
That's right. You don't do happy.

180
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:54,037
好了  我们到了
All right. Well, we're here.

181
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:58,035
我就是在这找到的  那棵树的旁边
I found it right by that tree.

182
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,004
这儿?
You found it here?

183
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:03,086
对  就在这找到的
Yeah. I found it here.

184
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:07,032
你在撒谎
You're lying.

185
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:09,097
我告诉你
Know what?

186
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,044
我根本就不认识你
I don't even know you.

187
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,098
你要看我在哪找到的
You asked to see where I found it.

188
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,017
我就是在这找到的
This is where I found it.

189
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:19,016
就这样了  祝你开心
We're done. Have a nice hike.

190
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:24,076
你不是在这找到雕像的
You did not find the statue here.

191
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,093
带我去飞机那
Take me to the plane.

192
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,059
你怎么知道这架飞机?
How did you know about the plane, man?

193
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,010
那已经是很久以前了 它很早就在丛林里了
It's old, you know.Been out in the jungle for years.

194
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,018
当然  你知道的  你什么都知道
Of course, you would know that.You know everything.

195
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:54,016
你为什么对那个女孩撒谎?
Why did you lie to the girl?

196
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:58,078
你告诉她你不知道雕像里装的是什么东西
You told her you did not know what was inside the statue.

197
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:00,064
我没有撒谎
I wasn't lying.

198
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:03,059
那么什么是误会?
Then what is the wrong idea?

199
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,070
什么?
What?

200
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,094
当我给你看雕像的碎片时
When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster,

201
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:12,088
你说你不希望她有什么误会
you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea.

202
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:17,015
是误会什么?
What is the wrong idea?

203
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,035
我不需要什么都说给你知道  伙计
I don't have to tell you anything.

204
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,059
你是长途跋涉穿过了整座岛过来的
You come traipsing across the island

205
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,060
突然  你变头头了?
and suddenly now you're in charge?

206
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,010
你想要我带你去你的飞机那里
You want me to take you to your plane?

207
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,021
你最好开始对我放尊重些
Start treating me with respect.

208
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:31,069
我不是那种你可以...
I'm not just some guy you can just tr...

209
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,040
什么?
What?

210
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:40,076
怎么了?
What?

211
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:44,000
我们走
Let's go.

212
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:47,086
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:04,016
先生  先生  如果你买座雕像
Sir, sir if you buy a statue,

214
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:08,009
那些钱会给村子用去买脊髓灰质炎的疫苗
the money will buy polio vaccine for the village.

215
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,012
300块  先生
300 naira, sir.

216
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,086
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

217
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:23,080
我是来忏悔的
I have come to give my confession.

218
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,086
你好  Eko
Hello, Eko.

219
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:32,055
你好  兄弟
Hello, Brother.

220
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,017
3年里我第一次来看你
I come to visit you for the first time in three years

221
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:40,059
而你却不听我的忏悔吗?
and you won't hear my confession?

222
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,017
你知道  神主曾经说过
Monsignor would have said he'd failed

223
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:44,067
他没能成功地培养天主教的孩子
to raise a proper Catholic boy.

224
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:48,010
好了  干嘛浪费你的时间忏悔呢? 对你没用的
Why waste your time confessing?It won't help you.

225
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,011
没用?
It won't?

226
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,093
是的  忏悔是有意义的
No.For confession to mean something,

227
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,086
你一定要有颗虔诚的心
you must have a penitent heart.

228
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,080
忏悔你和你的罪行吧  Yemi
You and your guilt, Yemi.

229
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,073
我这么做只是为了生存
I've only done what I needed to do to survive.

230
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:59,036
那怎么是罪行?
How is that a sin?

231
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:01,008
你可以远离这里生活
You may live far from here,

232
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,033
但是那不代表我没听说过你是怎么一个人
but I have heard of who you are

233
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:07,029
和你做过什么
and what you have done.

234
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,047
你忘了那天你是怎么面临抉择的么  兄弟?
Have you forgotten how you got that cross,

235
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,034
他们带走我的那天...
the day they took me?

236
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:22,065
那天我做的有罪吗  还是说可以被原谅
Is what I did that day a sin?Or is it forgiven,

237
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:27,048
因为我救的是你
because it is you that was saved?

238
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,030
你为什么来这  Eko?
Why are you here, Eko?

239
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,051
我来帮助你
I've come to help you.

240
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:46,037
我有一些货物需要运出国
I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country.

241
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:50,034
我想用你教会的一架飞机来运输
I would like one of your church relief flights to transport it.

242
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:54,046
"货物"?  你指毒品
Merchandise. You mean drugs.

243
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:57,022
那和我往常的生意不一样  Yemi
It is not my normal business.

244
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,038
我们要把毒品运出尼日利亚
We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria

245
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,063
这样可以使我们的人民远离毒品
so that they cannot be used by our people.

246
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,042
至于钱...
And you will have all the money

247
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:09,033
你可以拿所有的钱买疫苗
to buy your vaccine.

248
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:13,046
上帝给了我们这个机会
God has given us this opportunity.

249
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,096
我们不应该放过它
We should not turn our back on it.

250
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:17,077
上帝并没有要你来这里  Eko
God did not bring you here, Eko.

251
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:21,084
是你的贪婪带你来的
Your own greed did.

252
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,048
我会永远爱你...
I will always love you,

253
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:30,034
但我不会帮助你
but I will not help you.

254
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:39,001
很高兴再见到你  兄弟
It was good to see you again, Brother.

255
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,099
再靠耳朵一点  小姐
Little close to the ear.

256
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,049
你知道你在做什么么?
Sure you know what you're doing?

257
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,030
你可以把头转开吗?
Would you please turn your head?

258
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,078
为什么?  这样你就可以往我脖子上开一枪?
You ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck?

259
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:03,013
我可以自己理发
I can cut my own damn hair.

260
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:06,082
你知道  你不必要只是为了说话而说话
You don't have to be belligerent just for belligerence's sake.

261
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:09,013
现在每个人都喜欢你
Everyone loves you now.

262
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,034
瞎说
Bull pucky.

263
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:16,051
哟  Sawyer  欢迎你回来
Yo, Sawyer.Glad you're back, man.

264
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,059
看好你自己吧  药丸子
Yo yourself, Pillsbury.

265
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,090
了解了?
You see?

266
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,070
嘿  Kate...
Hey, Kate...

267
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,028
Locke说你一会要去仓子里轮班
Locke said you're on hatch duty later.

268
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:30,085
我在想是否...你不介意我替你去吧
I was wondering...You mind if I go instead?

269
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,045
你想代我当班?
You want my shift?

270
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,075
可以让我想些事情
Help me take my mind off things.

271
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,017
当然  你去吧
Sure, it's all yours.

272
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:41,000
谢谢  非常感谢
Thanks. Appreciate it.

273
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,046
很高兴你复原了  伙计
Glad you're OK, man.

274
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:51,077
恩
Yeah.

275
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:00,036
别提了
Don't even say it.

276
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:04,007
好了  是时间休息一下了
All right. Time to take a break.

277
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:07,039
我们刚刚才休息过
Just had a break.

278
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:19,093
我并不是你想象的那样
I'm not what you think I am.

279
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:23,031
我想象你是什么?
What do I think you are?

280
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,085
那都是我兄弟的错
It was my brother's fault.

281
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,062
什么?
Sorry?

282
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:29,050
我成为瘾君子是他的错
It was his fault I became an addict.

283
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,022
他开始吸毒  我试着阻止他
He started with the heroin.I tried to make him stop.

284
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:36,017
你并不了解  我是个好人
You don't know me, man.I was a good person.

285
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:40,003
我曾是神父的助手
I was an altar boy.

286
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,030
好了  我知道雕像里有什么
I knew what was in that statue.

287
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,000
那不意味着我需要这些东西
It doesn't mean I needed it.

288
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,016
所以别拿这些来评判我
So don't judge me, man.

289
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,091
别...
Don't... Just...

290
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,021
什么?
What?

291
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:05,067
那是什么?
What's that?

292
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:11,002
一个降落伞
It's a parachute.

293
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:26,029
那是个牧师?
Is that a priest?

294
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,063
你在做什么?
What're you doing?

295
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:50,041
你认识这人?
Do you know that guy?

296
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,064
是的
Yes.

297
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:57,078
这个人救了我的命
This man saved my life.

298
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:08,051
救了你的命  啊? 是啊  很合情合理
Saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense.

299
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:12,019
他在尼日利亚的一个平原起飞 而我们在南太平洋的中间
He takes off in a plane in Nigeria.We're in the South Pacific.

300
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,002
那简直太合情理了
That makes all the sense in the world.

301
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,008
这是经文
This is scripture written here.

302
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,055
你是个牧师  你是个牧师  是吗?
You're a priest, right?

303
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:39,083
他是个牧师  你也是  对吗?
He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right?

304
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:51,039
我需要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

305
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,074
我正在听他的忏悔
I'm in the middle of a confession.

306
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:55,024
没时间等了
It cannot wait.

307
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:57,003
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

308
00:22:57,003 --> 00:23:01,061
上帝与你同在  请早上再来
God be with you all.Please, come back in the morning.

309
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:05,035
没事的
It's OK.

310
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,088
你怎么敢来这里打扰我的工作
How dare you disrupt my work?

311
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,033
-你重新考虑过了吗? -什么?
-Have you reconsidered my request?  -What?

312
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,051
我的要求
My request

313
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:16,068
在教会的掩护下运送毒品?
Flying drugs under the cover of the Church?

314
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:18,062
我怎么可能考虑这种事情?
How could I ever reconsider?

315
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,010
听着  别碰那些东西
Don't touch those.

316
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,019
这件事办起来很简单
I am going to make this easy for you.

317
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,098
你让我们假扮成牧师 我们会自己把毒品运出去
You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out.

318
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:27,012
让你们假扮成牧师?
Make you priests?

319
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:28,093
在这些任命文件上签字
Sign these ordination documents.

320
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:32,071
我就会给你买疫苗的钱
I will give you the money for the vaccines.

321
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,019
马上给我离开教堂  Eko
Leave this church now.

322
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,085
马上给我走
Go. Now.

323
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:42,020
Yemi  我理解你生活在一个
Yemi, I understand that you live in a world

324
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,097
正邪分明的世界
where righteousness and evil seem very far apart,

325
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:48,089
但那并不是真正的世界
but that is not the real world.

326
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:51,075
我是你的兄弟而且我永远不会伤害你
I am your brother,I would never do anything to hurt you,

327
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:55,082
但是我的朋友...如果你不照我说的干
but my friends,if you do not do what I ask,

328
00:23:55,082 --> 00:24:01,016
他们会烧光这座教堂
they will burn this church to the ground.

329
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:10,068
这还不值得你在这纸上签个名么?
Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper?

330
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:17,095
想想你可以拯救的生命
Think of the lives you will save.

331
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:38,037
我的签名并不会让你们成为牧师  Eko
My signature does not make you a priest.

332
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:41,001
你永远不会成为牧师
You could never be a priest.

333
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,099
你们剩下多少雕像
How many of the statues do you have left

334
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:44,040
圣母玛利亚的雕像  还有多少?
How many of the Virgin Mary statues do you have left?

335
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,070
呃...300个
I've 300.

336
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,003
我全要了
I will take all of them.

337
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:57,081
我想我们现在都是有罪的了
I guess we are both sinners now.

338
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:06,075
也许我们是的  但是上帝会原谅我的  Eko
Perhaps we are,but God will forgive me.

339
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:29,017
我迷路了
I'm lost.

340
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:31,088
当时很黑  我跟着Sayid
It was dark. I was following Sayid.

341
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:33,091
头被什么东西砸了一下
A big bag of rocks fell on my head.

342
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:40,057
所以我很抱歉我对地理不太感冒
I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography.

343
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:44,063
爬到树上去
Climb that tree.

344
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,025
什么?
What?

345
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:47,049
爬上那棵树也许你就会有点方向感了
Perhaps you will get your bearings

346
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,005
或许会看到飞机
or see the plane.

347
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,062
爬上去
You climb it.

348
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:56,006
如果我不去呢?
What if I don't?

349
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:58,041
你会用你的圣经棒打我?
You going to beat me with your Jesus stick?

350
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,079
我觉得有点奇怪  你的棒子上有血迹
I find it odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it.

351
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,092
你到底爬不爬?
Are you going to climb that tree or not?

352
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:16,063
你到底是个什么牧师?
What kind of priest are you, anyway?

353
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,038
你要再爬高点
You need to get higher.

354
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:44,083
很好  谢谢
Wonderful. Thank you.

355
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:17,047
Eko  跑  快跑
Eko! Run! Run!

356
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,050
你看见了吗?
Did you see it?

357
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,041
是的  我看见了  你傻愣着干什么?
What the bloody hell did you do?

358
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,054
我什么也没干
I did nothing.

359
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:33,065
大多数人  当他们看见黑烟形成的东西都会跑
When most people see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run.

360
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:35,053
-我并不害怕那个东西  -我看的出来
-I was not afraid of it.  -I can see that.

361
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,061
-那个东西会杀人  -你看见飞机了吗?
-That thing kills people.  -Did you see the plane?

362
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:40,034
是的  看见了  它在那个方向一公里处
It's about a kilometre that way.

363
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,001
谢谢
Thank you.

364
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,074
等等
Wait.

365
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:18,064
拜托
Come on.

366
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:21,061
拜托
Come on.

367
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:25,006
你在哪里?
Where are you?

368
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:28,065
爸爸?

369
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,054
你还好吗?

370
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,055
我很好  谢谢

371
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,044
你一个人吗?

372
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,022
是的

373
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:55,014
不能说很久  他们就要回来了

374
00:29:55,078 --> 00:30:00,052
你在哪里?

375
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:04,049
你得来...

376
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:09,076
嘿  Michael
Hey, Michael.

377
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,075
你怎么样?
How you doing?

378
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:17,065
很好  谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

379
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,097
你一个人在这里?
You down here alone?

380
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,094
恩  Hurley也应该在这里
Hurley's supposed to be here.

381
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:27,015
但是  呃  我想他来晚了
But I guess he's running late.

382
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:34,083
好吧  听着  呃...
Well, listen, uh...

383
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,099
没人会忘了Walt
No one's forgotten about Walt.

384
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,031
-什么?  -我不能...
-What?  -I can't...

385
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:45,068
我完全不知道你们将经历什么
I don't have any idea what you must be going through.

386
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:49,065
但是我要你知道我们会尽快
I just want you to know that as soon as we can,

387
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,022
找到他在哪儿
we're gonna figure out a way to go out

388
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:56,017
然后把他带回来
and bring him back.

389
00:30:56,075 --> 00:31:01,012
恩  谢谢  伙计
Yeah.Thanks, man.

390
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:04,054
谢谢
Thanks.

391

你还好吧?
You OK?

392

是的  我很好
Yeah. I'm fine.

393
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:20,036
恩  那就拜托你了
I'll leave you to it, then.

394
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:23,048
谢谢
Thanks.

395
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,075
Eko

396
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,077
你来这干什么  Yemi?
What are you doing here, Yemi?

397
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:39,071
我来阻止你
I came to stop you.

398
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,067
回你的教堂去
Go to your church.

399
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,016
别上飞机  Eko
Do not get on that plane.

400
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,092
你救过我一次  现在我是来救你的
I'm here to save your life.

401
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:44,084
救我?
Save my life?

402
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:46,069
听着  如果你上了飞机  如果你这么做了...
If you get on, if you do this...

403
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,039
如果我做了什么  Yemi? 你现在是预言家?
If I do what? Are you a prophet now?

404
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,001
拜托  Eko 我听你的忏悔
Please, let me take your confession.

00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:58,051
任何我能做的事我都会做  但是  请不要走
Anything I can do, I will do. But please, don't go.

406

他向军方告发了
He told the military.

407
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:10,028
是你做的?
You did this?

408
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:12,009
我并没有告诉他们谁牵涉其中
I did not tell them who was involved.

409
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:16,052
离开那些毒品和我一起回去
Just leave the drugs and come back with me.

410
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:30,049
不  停下  别开枪了
Stop. No more.

411
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,058
Yemi  Yemi  Yemi

412

Yemi

你还好吧  神父?
Are you OK, Father?

417

424
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:16,027
耶和华是我的牧者  我必不至缺乏
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

425
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:20,028
他让我躺在青青的草地上
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

426
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:24,002
领我在可静静的水边
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

427
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,030
他使我的灵魂苏醒
He restoreth my soul.

428
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,065
以他的名义引导我正义的道路
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

429
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:35,069
尽管我漫步死亡峡谷的阴影中
Yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death,

430
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:39,092
我将不会害怕任何魔鬼  因为你与我同在
I fear no evil, for thou art with me.

431
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:47,089
你的杖  你的竿  都安慰着我
Thy rod, thy staff, they comfort me.

432
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:52,055
在我敌人面前
Thou preparest a table before me

433
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:56,016
你为我摆设筵席
in the presence of mine enemies,

434
00:38:56,016 --> 00:39:01,002
你用油膏涂了我的头
thou annointest my head with oil,

435
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:05,016
使我福杯满溢
my cup runneth over.

436
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:09,018
我一生一世

00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:12,012
必有恩惠慈爱随着我
all the days of my life,

这...这会让我感觉更安全
It just made me feel safer to have it around.

446
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:45,060
听着  我不能让你守着我的孩子  好么?
I can't have you around my baby.

447
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,040
Claire  我不...
Claire, I...

448
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,087
Charlie  我不想要你睡在我们附近 可以么?
I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us.

449
