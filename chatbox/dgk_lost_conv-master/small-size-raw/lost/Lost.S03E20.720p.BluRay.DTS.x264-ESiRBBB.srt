我是答应过你 John
I know I promised to tell you everything,John,

75
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:57,060
翻开一本旧书那么简单
me taking out a dusty old book and opening it up.

76
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,088
但没那么简单
But it's not that simple.

77
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:12,067
不如你来告诉我
How about you just tell me?

78
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,060
你或许认为

我是这个社区的领导
I'm the leader of this little community,

80
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,084
但这不完全正确
but that's not entirely true.

81
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:21,085
我们都得听一个人的 John
We all answer to someone,John.

82
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:25,051
那么这个人是谁呢?
And who might that be?

83
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,079
他叫Jacob
His name is Jacob.

84
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,002
那好 带我去见Jacob
Okay, then.Take me to Jacob.

85
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:34,013
我做不到
I can't do that.

86
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:37,050
-你去哪儿?    -Ben 如果你不愿意带我去
-Where are you going?  -Hell,Ben,if you don't want to take me,

87
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,052
也许其他人愿意  我会去问Richard
maybe someone else will. I'll just go and ask Richard.

88
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:43,007
Richard为什么会带你去?  他根本不知道Jacob在哪里
Why would richard take you? He doesn't know where Jacob is.

89
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,027
-他不和Jacob说话       -那谁才和他说话?
-He doesn't talk to Jacob.   -Well, who talks to him?

90
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,017
-我啊   -就你一个人吗?
-I do.  -Oh,you're the only one who talks to him?

91
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:50,035
-当然    -其他人都不知道他在哪儿?
-That's right.  -And no one else knows where he is?

92
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,094
我出生在这座岛上
I was born here on this island.

93
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,091
我在这里最有资格
I'm one of the last that was.

94
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:57,053
你看见的大多数人 都是我带来的
Most of these people you see--I brought them here,

95
00:05:57,053 --> 00:06:00,025
Jacob只跟我说话 John
so Jacob talks to me,John.

96
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,080
他告诉我该做什么
He tells me what to do,

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,057
他信任我
trusts me.

98
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:07,089
没有人见过他吗?
And no one else has ever seen him?

99
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,066
没错
That's right.

100
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,053
多方便啊
How convenient.

101
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,057
你知道我怎么想吗 Ben?
You know what I think,Ben?

102
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:16,016
我想根本就没什么Jacob
I think there is no Jacob.

103
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,061
你们的人都是白痴
I think your people are idiots

104
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:20,088
如果他们相信你从某人那里得到命令
if they believe you take orders from someone else.

105
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,091
你就是那个在幕后指使的人
You are the man behind the curtain...

106
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:28,025
就像绿野仙踪...
the wizard of oz...

107
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,072
你是个骗子
and you're a liar.

108
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:34,047
你凭什么这么说 John?
And what might you base that theory on, John?

109
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:37,059
因为如果你说的是实话
Because if you were telling the truth,

110
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:41,029
你的手就不会抖了
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

155
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:07,047
要一块吗?
Want one?

156
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:12,060
想要多少就有多少
We can have as many as we want.

157
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,074
"工人"?
"Work man"?

158
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:18,079
这是什么?  工人?
What is this? Work man?

159
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,025
我只是个当工的?
I'm a janitor?

160
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:24,004
-很抱歉Linus先生   -Goodspeed告诉我你们在做什么实验
-I'm sorry, Mr.Linus.  -Goodspeed told me you people were doing experiments,

161
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,023
改变世界
changing the world.

162
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,000
我可不是来打杂的
I didn't come here to clean up after you.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,039
如果工作有空闲
Look,if anything else opens up,

164
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,011
你随时都可以来申请
you can feel free to apply for it.

165
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:36,036
我们走
come on.

166
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:49,039
Hey,Sayid

167
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,045
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

168
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:57,011
-我和Locke在一起    -那他人呢?
-I was with Locke.  -Well,where is he?

169
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,063
他又回去了
He went back.

170
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:01,081
-回去哪里?    -和他们   别问我在哪里
-Back where?  -With them.Don't ask me where the hell it is,

171
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:03,081
因为现在说这个并不重要
'cause it doesn't matter right now.

172
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:08,078
真正重要的  是这个
What does matter... is this.

173
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,094
Ben在哪里?!
Where is Ben?!

174
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,089
他在哪里?!
Where is he?!

175
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:28,056
我以为你已经死了
I thought you were dead.

176
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:33,017
幸运的是高压电塔 没调到致命的级别
I'm fortunate the pylons were not set to a lethal level.

177
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:38,008
他在这里做什么?
What is he doing here?

178
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:42,025
他想杀了我
He's the one who tried to kill me.

179
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:46,044
他和我们是一伙的了
He's with us now.

180
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,063
你去哪里了 Mikhail?
Where have you been,Mikhail?

181
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,004
我遇见了他们的几个人
I encountered several of his people in the jungle.

182
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:53,040
还有一个受伤的女人
They had an injured woman with them.

183
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,076
很显然  她刚降落到这座岛上
Apparently,she had just parachuted onto the island.

184
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:59,014
-什么?  -她的直升机坠毁在了海里
-What?  -Her helo crashed in the water.

185
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:02,016
她说她的船就在朝西
She says her ship is approximately 130 clicks

186
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,090
130公里外
to the west of us.

187
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,069
-她有个卫星无线电    -她在哪儿?
-She has a radio-telephone. -Where is she now?

188
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:10,003
我猜是被他们带回营地了
I assume they have taken her back to their camp.

189
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,010
我们后天会造访他们的营地
We'll be visiting their camp day after tomorrow.

190
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,034
-到时会处理这件事的      -后天?  我们必须现在行动
-We'll take care of it then.    -Day after tomorrow? We have to go now.

191
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:19,046
-Ben不会和你去任何地方的    -你说什么?
-Ben's not going anywhere with you.  -Excuse me?

192
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:23,052
他和我要去见Jacob
He and I are going to see Jacob.

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,073
告诉我他说的不是实话 Benjamin
Please tell me this isn't true,Benjamin.

194
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,043
抱歉  我必须先处理这件事 John
Sorry. I have to deal with this now, John.

195
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:43,013
我们的旅行只能延后了
Our excursion will have to wait.

196
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:48,033
什么时候开始你要向他做出解释 一个外来者?
Since when do you explain yourself to him--an outsider?

197
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:52,057
Tom

198
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:55,049
Richard?!

199
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,024
我们什么时候出发?
so when do we leave?

200
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:14,082
你不用毫无道理的揍Mikhail 
you know, you didn't have to beat Mikhail senseless

201
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:17,057
来表示你的想法 John
to make your point, John.

202
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,058
不  我用的着
Yes, I did.

203
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,049
Locke...

204
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:28,070
我听说你要去见Jacob
I hear you're gonna go see Jacob.

205
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,095
你需要这个
You're gonna need this.

206
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,080
谢谢
Thanks.

207
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,033
生日快乐  爸爸
Happy birthday, dad.

208
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,007
当水加入了小苏打里
so once water is added to the bicarbonate,

209
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:09,072
我们的火山就会爆发了
we will get our very own volcanic reaction.

210
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,048
是的
Yes.

211
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:12,085
这里的火山也这样吗?
Is that what happened to the volcano on this island?

212
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:17,003
完全正确 Annie  不过那还是在很久以前了
Exactly,Annie,but that was a long time ago.

213
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:19,023
好了  我们来实践一下
Okay,let's get ourselves an eruption.

214
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:21,010
太棒了!
oh,cool!

215
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,067
只要加入水
Just add water,and voil.

216
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:27,040
我知道这不是喷发...
Now I know it's not lava,but--

217
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:30,016
那是什么?!
what was that?!

218
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:33,021
不  他们来了
oh no they're coming

219
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,059
大家各就各位
okay,everyone,into your positions.

220
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,067
大家都趴下 快点!
Everyone,get down! Hurry!

221
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,044
到这边来!
Get over here!

222
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,092
对了  待在一块儿
That's right,all together.

223
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:43,049
Annie 请你把门锁了
Annie,lock the back door,please.

224
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,012
快点!
Ben,come on,honey,

225
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:51,023
快行动起来 Ben!
you gotta move.Ben!

226
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,016
来啊
come on!

227
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,080
别担心  只是"敌人们"
don't worry. It's just the hostiles.

228
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,028
我们会没事的
We'll be okay.

229
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:11,032
趴下!
get down!

230
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,067
老兄  听说你遇到麻烦了
hey,man,I heard you ran into a little trouble.

231
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,029
我们从飞机那儿往回赶
we were driving back from the plane,

232
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,075
听见了巨大的爆炸声
and we hear this huge explosion.

233
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:22,034
警笛响个不停
Next thing I know,there's a siren wailing,

234
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,094
我们从枪林弹雨中回来了
and we're driving through the middle of a shootout.

235
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,085
我们和当地人有些冲突
Look,we're having some skirmishes with the natives.

236
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:28,033
你什么意思  当地人?
What do you mean,natives?

237
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,066
我们还不确定他们到底是什么人
Well,we're not exactly sure who they are.

238
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:33,022
我不是为了这个来的
Well,this ain't what I signed up for.

239
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,032
Roger 我帮助过你
Roger,I did you a favor,man.

240
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,019
你自己找不到工作
You were having trouble finding work,

241
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,027
别忘了Ben 他在这里接受良好的教育
and don't forget about Ben. He's getting a quality education.

242
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,020
我对他的教育不感兴趣
I don't give a damn about his education.

243
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,053
如果我被射中了 我需要保险
If I'm gonna get shot at,I want hazard pay.

244
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:47,031
-我要另外30000    -冷静点  老兄
-I want another 30 grand.  -Calm down,man.

245
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,042
别告诉我你没有
and don't try to tell me you don't have it.

246
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:55,095
你听见了吗?  从我家滚出去
You hear me? Now get the hell out of my house.

247
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:09,023
我告诉过你早点睡觉
I thought I told you to go to bed.

248
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,024
她不在这里
She's not here.

249
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,008
早就知道
I noticed.

250
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,037
你们在做什么?
What are you doing?

251
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,096
在找Juliet
Looking for Juliet.

252
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,005
你们在这里找不到她
Well,you're not gonna find her in there.

253
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,087
-她和Jack一起走了     -Juliet和Jack吗?
-She left with jack.  -Juliet left with Jack?

254
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,057
在我告诉他关于Naomi的事后他就走了
He took off right after I told him about Naomi.

255
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,002
谁是Naomi?
Who's Naomi?

256
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,066
你为什么要这么做 Kate?
And why would you do that,kate?

257
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,012
因为她受伤了 而他又是个医生
Because she's hurt,because he's a doctor

258
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,067
因为他有权知道
and because he has a right to know.

259
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,054
他现在在哪里?
Where is he now?

260
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:01,058
-我不知道 Sayid      -你当然不知道
-I don't know,sayid. -Of course you don't.

261
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,069
是时候告诉大家Naomi的事了
It might be time for you to tell everybody else about Naomi,too.

262
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,064
给她放磁带
Play her the tape.

263
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:10,049
什么磁带?
What tape?

264
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:18,086
在走之前我要告诉你 John
There's something you should know,John,before we go.

265
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,047
不管你认为他是Oz的巫师(绿野仙踪)还是别的什么
Whether or not you think he's the wizard of oz,

266
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:27,053
我能保证Jacob是一个非常真实的人
I can assure you that Jacob is very,very real.

267
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:30,039
我们要去见他
And we're gonna go see him,

268
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,098
他会很不开心的
and he's not gonna like it.

269
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:38,050
我想他会非常生气的
In fact,I have a feeling he's gonna be very...angry.

270
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:41,031
那就是我手抖的原因
And that's why my hand was shaking,

271
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:44,087
因为那个人不是你能造访的
because this is not a man you go and see.

272
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,086
是他召唤你
This is a man who summons you.

273
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:54,006
凡事总有第一次嘛!
Well,I guess there's a first time for everything.

274
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:36,049
这是我们
It's us.

275
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,089
那个是你 这个是我
That's you,and that's me.

276
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,040
我们会永远在一起了
Now we never have to be away from each other.

277
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,010
生日快乐 Ben
Happy birthday,Ben.

278
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,065
谢谢
Thanks.

279
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:56,050
别客气
You're welcome.

280
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:44,084
今天是你生日
it's your birthday.

281
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:49,055
抱歉我忘了
Sorry I forgot.

282
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,048
在你把你妈杀了的这天
It's kinda hard to celebrate

283
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:57,014
庆祝恐怕有些困难
on the day you killed your mom.

284
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,063
她怀孕才7个月
She was just seven months pregnant.

285
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:01,022
我们去徒步旅行
We went for a hike,

286
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,085
没想到早产了
but you had to come early.

287
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:08,094
现在她死了...
Now she's gone...

288
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:14,082
而我只能和你困在这座岛上
and I'm stuck here on this island...with you.

289
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,042
生日快乐 Ben
happy birthday,Ben.

290
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:55,032
妈妈?
mom?

291
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,057
Ben不要
Ben,don't!

292
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:06,083
妈妈!
Mom!

293
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,056
现在还不是时候 Benjamin
It's not time yet,Benjamin.

294
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,057
妈妈!
Mom!

295
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:00,059
我们走 John
Let's go,John.

296
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:04,022
John

297
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,044
整个世界都认为我们死了?
So,what,the whole world thinks we're dead?

298
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:14,097
-现在这个并不重要   -不重要吗?
-That's not important right now.   -Not important?

299
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:18,054
-什么才是重要的Sayid?  -抱歉
What do you mean,it's not important,sayid?  -excuse me.

300
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:21,052
我很抱歉  你们不想得救吗?
I'm sorry.  Don't you people want to be rescued?

301
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:23,017
我们为她保密来保证我们的安全
We kept her a secret to keep her safe.

302
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,039
为了什么 Sayid?
Safe from what,Sayid?

303
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,080
为了Jack 他和"the others"一起待了一周
Safe from Jack. He spent a week with the others,

304
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,010
还带了一个他们的人回来
and he brought one of them back with him,

305
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,099
在这里  我们当中
here,amongst us,

306
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:36,068
每次我们去问这个女人的时候
and every time we try to get answers from this woman,

307
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:38,059
他总会去保护她
he prevents her from giving them.

308
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,072
但他是Jack啊
But it's jack.

309
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,054
他永远不会做伤害我们的事
He would never do anything to hurt us.

310
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:48,009
-还有Juliet  我相信她是个好人   -好人咯?
-And Juliet... I believe she's a good person.  -Good person,huh?

311
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,007
你凭什么这样认为? 不会就是因为她带你...
You're base in that on what? Wouldn't involve her taking you to

312
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:52,036
去了他们的一个医疗站吧?
one of their medical stations,

313
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:57,017
-是吗 Kwon女士?   -你是怎么...

Kwon怀孕了
kwon is pregnant.

315
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:01,015
她是在这里受的孕  胎儿很健康
The fetus is healthy and was conceived on island with her husband.

316
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,083
他丈夫在来这之前不能生育
He was sterile before they got here.

317
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,020
我还在搜集其他女人的样本
I'm still working on getting samples from the other women.

318
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,056
应该很快能弄到Austen的

319
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,088
有消息再联络...
I'll report back when I know more.

320
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:13,073
你从哪里弄到的?
Where'd you get that?

321
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,047
你去哪儿了 Jack?
Where have you been,Jack?

322
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:17,005
我问你哪儿弄来的?
I asked you where you got it.

323
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,031
你以为你有权利...
You really think

324
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:20,037
-来问我们吗?  -放磁带的另一面
-you're in a position to be asking us questions? -Turn the tape over.

325
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:22,087
-想都别想  -你想一把火烧死我  我就在这里!
-Stay out of it.  -You wanna burn me at stake? Here I am.

326
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:27,067
但首先你得把磁带翻过来 按下"播放"键
But first,turn the tape over. Press "play."

327
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,016
Juliet 我是Ben
Juliet,it's Ben.

328
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:40,032
我会派出3个小队 来带走Kwon
I'm sending three teams to extract kwon

329
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,093

00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,090
没时间搜集Austen的样本了
We won't have time to run Austen's sample,

331
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,082
如果你确定他们怀孕了
so if you determine that she or anyone else is pregnant,

332
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:51,066
在他们的帐篷上做上标记 我们会把他们一起带走
mark their tents,and we'll take them,too.

333
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:54,044
祝你好运
Good luck.

334
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:01,073
在我们用超声波仪器的当晚
the night I saw your baby on the ultrasound,

335
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:05,073
我就告诉Jack 他们逼我这样做的
I told Jack what they were making me do.

336
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:09,007
为什么不告诉我们?
Why didn't you tell us?

337
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,099
因为我还不知道 该怎么做
Because I hadn't decided what to do about it yet.

338
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,087
"还不知道?"
"Yet?"

339
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:24,017
我想我们要忙一阵子了
I think we got some catching up to do.

我不想吓着你
Whoa,I didn't mean to scare you.

346
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:24,036
你迷路了吗  等等!
Wait,wait. Are you lost? Wait.

347
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,072

One of who?

"敌人"
A hostile.

350
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,071
你还不懂那词的意思
Do you even know what that word means?

351
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,026
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

352
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:40,003
Ben

353
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:42,019
能告诉我你一个人
So you wanna tell me what you're doing

354
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,095
在丛林当中做什么吗?
in the middle of the jungle all by yourself?

355
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,055
我离开了家...
I left home,and...

356
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,097

你认为她在这里?
You think she's out here?

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,072
你不会相信我的
You wouldn't believe me.

359
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,060
说来听听
Try me.

360

不是

是在我很小的时候
When I was a baby.

你在...
Did you see her...

365

Maybe that can happen...

376

如果这就是你想要的Ben
Maybe,I mean,if that's what you really want,Ben,

377
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:02,005
这是你真正想要的
if that's what you want.

378
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:05,023
我要你好好想想...
I want you to think about that...

00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:11,077
你必须很有耐心
And you're gonna have to be very,very patient.

380

我们到了
We're here.

381
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:49,012

You'll want to turn off your flashlight,John.

382
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:51,087
为什么?
Why?

Jacob和你一样不喜欢高科技产品
Jacob feels the same way about technology as you do.

一旦打开这扇门 你就没有回头路了
Once I open this door,there's no turning back.

385
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:43,092
你确定要这样做吗?

那好吧
So be it.

他就坐在这个椅子上

你想要知道这座岛的秘密吗?
You wanted the secrets of the island?

403
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:06,053
他们都在这里
Well,here they are.

00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:25,023
你对这座岛一无所知对吗?
You don't know anything about the island,do you?

410
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,085
都是你编造出来的
You just made it all up.

411
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,026
-Jacob 求你了  我听不见他...     -停下
-Jacob,please,I can't hear him... - Stop.

412
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:33,048
-如果不是你说的那么响   -停下  闭嘴!
-If you're gonna talk over what he's saying   -stop.Shut up!

很抱歉你这么想 John
I'm sorry you feel that way,John,

419
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,076
很抱歉你的眼界太狭窄了

他什么也没对我说

你是个骗子
you're a fraud

438
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,010
你的人该知道真相
and this time your people will tell the truth

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,063
而且这不是我们来的路
and this is not the way we came

我不知道为什么我会傻到相信...
I don't know why I keep fooling myself into thinking
