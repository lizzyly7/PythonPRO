Locke先生?
Mr. Locke?

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,240
你弄清楚 他们藏在潜水艇上的东西了?
You found what they were hiding in the submarine?

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,070
一清二楚
I most certainly did.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,420
啊!
Aah!

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,120
- 你好 Hugo  - 我们得跟你谈谈
- Hello, Hugo.  - We have to talk to you.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,230
"我们"?
"We"?

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,760

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,550

Come on out.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,790
你好 Jack
Hello, Jack.

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,020
我正等着你呢
I was hoping you'd come.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,080
我想 我们得好好叙叙旧呢
I think we have some catching up to do.

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,500
Hurley啊...
Hurley...

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,340
来见他是你的主意
This was your idea.

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,390
我跟他谈谈 没事吧?
You all right with me talking with him alone?

20
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,710
自己当心 伙计
It's all you, dude.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,200
走吧 去谈吧
All right, let's catch up.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,100
你这模样真像他
You look just like him.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,160
没给你造成困扰吧?
Does it bother you?

24
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,310
不 让我困扰的是
No, what bothers me is

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,840
- 我根本不晓得你是什么东西  - 这倒是
- I don't have any idea what the hell you are.  - Sure you do.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,420
为什么挑John Locke?
Why John Locke?

27
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,030
因为他笨得相信
Because he was stupid enough to believe

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,180
自己是基于某个理由 而到这儿来的
that he'd been brought here for a reason,

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,460
因为他对此始终坚信不疑 直到因此身亡
because he pursued that belief until it got him killed,

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,990
还因为你的善良
and because you were kind enough

31
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,890
用一具精致木棺 将他的遗体运载来此
to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,760
还因为你要扮成他 所以他必须得死吧
He had to be dead before you could look like him.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,270
没错
That's right.

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,820
你还想扮成谁?
Who else have you looked like?

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,350
Jack 你到底想问我什么?
Jack, what do you really want to ask me?

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
我们到这儿来的第三天 我看见...
The third day we were here, I saw...

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,790
我在林间追逐我爸...
I chased my father through the jungle...

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,910
我... 已故的父亲
My... my dead father.

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,600
他也是你扮成的?
Was that you?

40
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,420
没错 是我
Yes, that was me.

41
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,570
为什么?
Why?

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,730
你需要找到水源
You needed to find water.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,490
可能说出来你不信 Jack
This may be hard for you to believe, Jack,

44
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,030
但我所做的一切都是为了帮你
but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.

45
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,650
帮我?
Help me?

46
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,400
干嘛?
To do what?

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,330
离开这里
Leave.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,630
因为Jacob选了你
But because Jacob chose you,

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,820
所以在你没来之前 你就已经注定要受困此岛
you were trapped on this island before you even got here.

50
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,110
但现在 Jacob死了
But now Jacob's dead.

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,900
我们再也不用被困在这儿了
We don't have to be trapped anymore.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,960
我们可以登上飞机 想走就走
We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.

53
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,480
如果我们真的想走就能走
And if we can just fly away whenever we want,

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,270
那你为何还在这里?
why are you still here?

55
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,920
因为我得找齐所有人
Because it has to be all of us.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,920
怎么了?
What?

57
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,560
我们当中 John Locke是唯一一个
John Locke was the only one of us

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
对该地抱有信仰的人
that ever believed in this place.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,870
他竭尽全力
He did everything he could

60
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,590
阻止我们离岛
to keep us from leaving this island.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,970
John Locke可不是个信徒 Jack
John Locke was not a believer, Jack.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,750

He was a sucker.

我几乎已经不指望
You know, I pretty much gave up hoping

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,510
你会回来了
that you'd ever come back.

108
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,300

having that little meet-up in the elevator?

154
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,670
一周后... 砰
And a week later... boom.

155
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,520
洛杉矶有那么多汽车 你偏偏撞到了我的车
Of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine.

156
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
就像有人要把我们拴在一块儿
Almost like someone's trying to put us together.

157

你在跟我搭讪吗?
Are you hitting on me?

158

没可能的 宝贝
It'd never work, sweetheart.

- 我是个警察 你是个杀人犯...  - 我跟你说过了 我不是杀人犯
- I'm a cop. You're a murderer...  - I already told you. I'm not a murderer.

160
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,660
好吧 但我还是警察啊
Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.

161
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,030
那你为什么不抓我呢?
So why didn't you arrest me?

一个想要人帮忙开门的美女
a pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.

168

You know what I think?

169
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,530
我觉得你放了我 是因为你去过澳大利亚
I think you let me go because you went to Australia,

170
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,880
但你又不想让别人知道你去了那儿
and you didn't want anyone to know you were there.

171
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,230
当联邦干探来的时候 我该把这告诉他们吗?
Should I tell that to the Feds when they get here?

172
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
- 哦 我喜欢你  - 哦

我想我们都变了
Guess we're all different now.

188
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,650
Locke跟你说了什么?
So what did Locke say to you?

189
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,590

He said that he wants to leave,

190
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,240

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,230
抱歉 我想问一个私人点的问题 嗯
Excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but, um,

228
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
我无意间发现
I couldn't help noticing

229
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,420
你要去收养局... 而且独自一人去

但是 嗯 我正好要去见一位律师
But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my way to see one.

235
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,800
你知道 收养合同很麻烦
You know, adoption contracts are complicated.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,720
你该留神点儿
And you should be careful

237
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
因为你可能会陷入麻烦
because you could find yourself in a situation

238
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,660
而且永无宁日
that's irreversible.

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,810
问题是 我... 我没钱请律师

Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor.

244
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,350
所以...
So...

245
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,070
你为什么不去见见她呢?
Why don't you just come and meet her?

246
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,040
况且 我觉得她能给你实际帮助
You know, I think she could really help you.

那些人又想要杀我们
People are trying to kill us again.

278
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,140
这些人胁迫我们
but these people have forced our hand,

279
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,380
口口声声说 我们偷了他们的东西
claiming we stole something from them,

280
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,870
想要挑事
trying to provoke us into a confrontation.

281
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,960
如果他们想打 那我们就打
Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get.

我们大家一起划船去另一个岛
We'll all sail over to the other island together.

- 你能办到吗 James?  - 为什么我们不一起去弄船?
- Can you do that, James?  - How come we're not all heading for it together?

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,010
人越多 办起事来越麻烦
The bigger the group, the slower it moves.

292
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,700
- 好吧 我需要个帮手  - 随你挑

Can you give me a hand with somethin'?

297
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,170

Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

298
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,900

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,900
是什么交易?
What kind of deal?

301
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,050
听我说 只要一有机会
Just listen. First chance you get,

302
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,380
你就折回来 到这个地点
You double back, hoof it to this spot.

303

这儿有一个废弃的码头

那Sayid和Claire呢?

306
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,230
Sayid就是个傀儡 Claire疯疯癫癫的
Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts.

307
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,380
从她想杀Kate的那一刻起 飞机上就没她的位置了
She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill kate,

308
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,690
而且我不会再让她有机会对Kate下手了
and I ain't gonna let that happen again.

309
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,370
叫上Hugo Sun 和那个飞行员 只有这些人 明白吗?
That's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?

310
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,090
但是我怎么带大家从... 从Locke的眼皮底下离开?
But how am I supposed to get us away from... from Locke?

311
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,860
你自己想办法
You figure it out.

312
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,700
准备开路了吗?
Ready to roll?

313
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,170
- 刚才那是怎么回事?  - 男人间的对话

我要你去我处理Desmond的地方
I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.

315
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,690
我以为你不打算让他活着回来了
I thought you weren't going to give him back.

316
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,210
我的确有这打算
I'm not.

317
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,720
我要你去杀了他
You're gonna kill him.

318
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,270
这不会有什么问题的 对吧 Sayid?
And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid?

319
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,550
你仍想要我做成那件答应你的事 对吗?
You do still want what you asked me for, right?

320
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,300

那就按我说的做
Then go do what I said.

如果你要冷血地把我干掉 兄弟...
If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...

323
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,100
我觉得我有权知道
I think I have a right to know

324
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,970
你能得到什么
what you're gettin' in exchange for it.

325
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,460
他告诉我 我可以找回我失去的一些东西
He told me I could get something back I lost.

326

她现在在哪儿?
And where is she now?

她死了
Dead.

330
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,860
你凭什么觉得Locke可以把她带回来?
And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?

331
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,500
我死过一次...
I died...

332
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,680
他把我救活了
And he brought me back.

333
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,420

This woman...

336
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,520
当她问你 你是怎么才和她重聚的...

因为没算上她

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,510
他不应该由我来抚养
And I never should've raised him.

然后我就拿枪逼着一个人

我喜欢这主意
I like that idea.

501

我看见船舱里有些罐头
I saw some canned food down in the galley.

502
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,940
有人饿了吗?
Anybody else starvin'?

503

没有想到你会出现 医生
Didn't think you'd show up, doc.

508
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,760
什么?
Sorry?

509
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,180
你可不是个唯命是从的人
Taking orders ain't your strong suit.

510
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,990
很开心 最后还是见到你了
Nice to see you finally came around.

511
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,790
感觉有些不对
This doesn't feel right.

512
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
感觉什么不对呢?
What doesn't feel right?

513
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,470
离开这个岛
Leaving the island.

514
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,500
你想告诉我为什么不要离开吗?
You wanna tell me why not?

515
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,580
因为我仍然清晰地记得 我上次离开时的感受...
Because I remember how I felt last time I left...

516
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,640
感觉像是失去了部分自我
Like a part of me was missing.

517
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,220
他们有治那种幻觉的药 医生
They got pills for that, doc.

518
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,190
我们之所以被带到这里
We were brought here

519
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,580
是因为 我们注定要来这里做些什么的 James
because we're supposed to do something. James.

520
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,170
还有 如果Locke... 那个... 那个东西...
And if Locke... that... that thing...

521
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,880
想要我们离开呢?
wants us to leave?

522
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,370
如果我们留在岛上 或许会发生令它害怕的事吧
Maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.

523
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,520
滚下我的船去
Get off my damn boat.

524
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,580
什么?
What?

525
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,040
是时候做出抉择了
You got a decision to make and you make it now.

526
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,270
要不你跟着我们
Either you're with us,

527
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,970
继续对自己说这些疯话
you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself,

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,910
- 要不你就跳到海里去  - James 这样做是不对的
- or you're going in the water.  - James, this is a mistake.

529
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,780
而且我知道 你或多或少 也有这种感觉
And I know there's a part of you that feels that.

530
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,110
这个岛和我们还没完呢
The island is not done with us yet.

531
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,160
是呢 呃 但是我和这个岛已经玩完了
Yeah, well, I'm done with this island.

532
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,310
所以如果你执着于你的感受 Jack 那你就那么做吧
So if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it.

533
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,590
滚下我的船去
Get off my damn boat.

534
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,940
对于Juliet因我而死 我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.

535
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,110

537
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,130

- What did you say to him?  - He changed his mind.

538
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,590
他反悔了 什么意思?!
What do you mean, he changed his mind?!

539
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,930
- 你都和他说了些什么?  - 他不跟我们一起走了
- What did you say to him?!  - He ain't comin' with us.

540
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,510
我们必须回去救他上来
We have to go back and get him.

541
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,950
我们不能再回头了 Kate
We're done going back, Kate.

542
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:14,082

Jin啊?

543
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:16,692

546
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,672

你中弹了

547
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:28,602

但是你会好起来的...

548
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:30,712

那咱们的孩子呢?

549
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,642

孩子很好

550
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,592

都结束了...

551
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,612

我们都会好起来的

So all these years,

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,970
哇哦 我无法想象他居然从未提及过她

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,450
是呢 呃 你爷爷有好多的秘密呢
Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.

557
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,080
是你自己这么觉得吧?

558
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,200
可能是吧

大家都靠拢些 营地在这边

582
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,610
我们开走了他的船
before Locke's figured out we made off with his ride.

583
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,950
- 把手举起来!  - 嘿! 哇!

没别人了! 如果你是想知道Locke在哪里

589
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,450
他现在还在主岛呢

What's it look like I'm doin'? Hands up now.

606
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,950
所有人都跪在地上!
On your knees, all of you!

00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,600
Jack? 你还好吗?
Jack? You all right?

613
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,760
