00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,950
我什么秘密都没有
I don't have any secrets.

00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,160
问...
Ask...

155
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,860

抱歉 让你受苦了
I'm sorry we had to put you through that.

- It was a test. We had to be sure.  - Test to be sure of what?

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,290
别担心
Don't worry.

159
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,110
你通过测试了
You passed.

160
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,490
我刚才骗了他 对吧?
I just lied to him, didn't I?

161
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,280
是的
Yes.

162
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:03,858
你刚才要去哪?
Where were you going?

163
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:05,778
什么?
What?

164
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,218
在我跳上出租车之前 你要去哪?
Before I got in the cab, where were you going?

165
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,328
问这干嘛 你也想劫持他们?
Why, so you can hijack them, too?

166
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,318
我等公车
I was waiting for a bus.

167
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,728
我来把你的东西给你
I came to bring you stuff.

168
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:19,968
放心 我没拿你钱
Relax. I didn't take your money.

169
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,528
啊 呃 好吧 谢谢
Well, uh, gee, thanks.

170
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,618
- 那你刚才要去哪?  - 别操心了
- So where were you goin'?  - Don't worry about it.

171
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,088
好吧
Fine.

172
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:36,798
Langdon大街
Langdon Street.

173
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:37,938
在Brentwood
Brentwood.

174
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,118
你在那有亲人?
You got family there?

175
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,068
呃 没有
Uh, no.

176
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,898
就是... 一对夫妻要收养我的孩子
It's the... a couple who's adopting my baby.

177
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:50,868
他们 呃 他们本该来机场接我
They were, hum, they were meant to meet me at the airport,

178
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,718
但是我猜 可能是日子弄错了什么的
but I guess they got the days mixed up or somethin'.

179
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,178
- 他们不像反悔了的样子  - Brentwood不远 上车
- It's not like they abandoned me.  - Brentwood's not far. Get in.

180
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,858
说真的?
Seriously?

181
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,798
你想不想搭车?
Do you want a ride or not?

182
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,608
你们为什么要我们在庙里待着?
So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?

183
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:16,868
我们在保护你们
We're protecting you.

184
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:19,948
- 要防什么?  - 你在这岛上待了一段时间 对吗?
- From what?  - You've been on this island for a while, right?

185
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,768
见没见过一丛黑烟...
Ever see a big pillar of black smoke...

186
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:25,688
- 会发出"嘀嗒嘀嗒"的声音 好像生气了一样?  - 见过
- makes a "ticka ticka" sound, looks pissed off?  - Yes.

187
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:26,778
防的就是它
From that.

188
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,288
你知道另外一架飞机的事吗?
Do you know anything about another plane coming in?

189
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:33,658
- 一架Ajira飞机  - 抱歉 这是新闻发布会吗?
- An Ajira flight.  - I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?

190
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,038
我觉得他说的是那架降落...
I think he means the one that landed...

191
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,788
Justin 闭嘴
Justin. Shut up.

192
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,308
不 不 不 那条路是用来迷惑人的
No, no, no, that's a decoy trail.

193
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:47,208
他从这儿走了
He went this way.

194
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:50,128
- 你凭什么这么说?  - 经验
- And you're basing this on what?  - Experience.

195
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,118
Aldo呀
Aldo.

196
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,258
干嘛?
What?

197
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,848
我觉得她说对了
I think she's right.

198
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,848
她当然对
Of course she is.

199
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:58,988
请您带路 公主
After you, princess.

200
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,268
你想用什么办法把男朋友带回来?
So what's your strategy for bringing you boyfriend back?

201
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:06,228
希望你有辄 因为他出去的时候 射伤了个人
I hope you got one, because he shot a guy on his way out.

202
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:08,528
- 他要是这么对我的话 我就把他脑袋打爆  - 喂 看着点儿
- If he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.  - Whoa. Watch it.

203
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,528
谢谢
Thank you.

204
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,968
看着像Rousseau的陷阱
Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.

205
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,228
那法国女人? 不 她已经死了好几年了
The French woman? No, she's been dead for years.

206
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,638
- 这... 这不可能是她的...  - Justin!
- This... this couldn't be one of her...  - Justin!

207
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,568
闭嘴
Shut up.

208
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,428
他要说什么?
What was he gonna say?

209
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,748
你都不记得我了 是吗?
You don't even remember me, do you?

210
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,338
你认不出我?
You don't recognize me?

211
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:35,898
哦 可能这个会让你想起来
Well, maybe this will jog your memory.

212
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:36,928
3年前
Three years ago,

213
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:40,368
你上演了一出越狱 而且你是用
you staged yourself a little prison break, and you did it

214
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,388
来福枪的枪托 敲晕了旁边的警卫
by knocking the guard out with the butt of you rifle.

215
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:44,068
那个人就是我
That would be me.

216
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,948
你干什么?
What are you doing?

217
00:16:58,888 --> 00:16:59,988
逃跑
Escaping.

218
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:08,328
Sayid啊!
Sayid!

219
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:11,898
还好吗 哥们儿?
You okay, man?

220
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,828
Jack! 他回来了!
Jack! He's back!

221
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,678
Sayid 发生什么事了?
Sayid, what happened?

222
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,628
- 他们对我用刑  - 为什么?
- They tortured me.  - Why?

223
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:28,568
不知道 他们什么也没问
Don't know. They didn't ask any questions.

224
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,518
让开
Step aside.

225
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,088
嘿 Shephard
Hey, Shephard.

226
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:00,078
我们正盼着你自己过来
We were hoping you'd come on your own.

227
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,058
你们到底对Sayid做了什么?
What the hell did you do to Sayid?

228
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:06,828
我们... 什么都没做 你... 你朋友病了
We... we didn't do anything to him. Y... your friend is sick.

229
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,188
他是...
He's...

230
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:15,238
是的 我... 这真的不能...
Yeah, I... It's not really...

231
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,808
这真的直译不了
It's not really a literal translation.

232
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,728
最接近的说法是...
The closest thing would be...

233
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:20,398
感染
infected.

234
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:23,268
感染? 他都没有发烧
Infected? He's not even running a fever.

235
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:26,748
什么意思...
What...

236
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,858
我说了什么好笑的话吗?
Did I say something funny?

237
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:31,878
我不这么认为 他一点幽默感都没有
I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.

238
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,408
他说 你得把这粒药给你朋友
He says you have to give your friend this pill.

239
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:51,288
你说真的?
Are you serious?

240
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:54,908
为什么你不自己给他?
Why don't you give it to him?

241
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,398
因为只有他自己愿意吃 才有效果
Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly,

242
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,358
但是由我们给他 他肯定是不情愿的
and won't take it willingly from us.

243
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,938
呃 你们也许该在对他用刑之前
Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it

244
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:02,998
- 让他吃药  - 我们没有对他用刑
- before you tortured him.  - We didn't torture him.

245
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:10,028
- 我们只是在为他诊断  - 看他是不是真感染了
- We were diagnosing him.  - To see if he was infected.

246
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,498
是的
Yes.

247
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,148
除非我知道成分
I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid

248
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,888
否则我不会拿给Sayid
unless I know what's in it.

249
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,218
告诉我 Shephard...
Tell me, Shephard...

250
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,108
你的朋友...
Your friend...

251
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:25,558
他是怎么中枪的?
How did he get shot?

252
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,648
他是 呃...
He was, um...

253
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:32,638
他是为了帮助我
He was helping me.

254
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,528
所以 错在你?
So it was your fault?

255
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,238
是的
Yes.

256
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:39,848
那还有其他人
And there have been others

257
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,638
为了帮你...
who were hurt or died...

258
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:44,378
而受伤或牺牲了吗?
helping you?

259
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:46,958
是的
Yes.

260
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:50,718
那...
Well...

261
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:56,268
这是你赎罪的机会
Then this is your chance to redeem yourself.

262
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,278
这是药
It's medicine,

263
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:07,658
你的朋友需要它
and your friend needs it.

264
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,858
我如果不拿给他 会怎么样?
What happens if I don't give it to him?

265
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,148
感染会扩散
The infection will spread.

266
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:30,268
所以... 没别的了? 啥也没有?
So... nothing? There wasn't anything?

267
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:34,038
没有白光? 没有天使唱歌?
No white light? Angels singing?

268
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:35,538
没有死去的亲友?
No dead relatives?

269
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,838
我记得我被打中了
I remember being shot.

270
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,838
你不是变成僵尸了吧?
You're not a zombie, right?

271
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,648
不 我不是僵尸
No. I am not a zombie.

272
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,548
嘿
Hey.

273
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,588
能让我和Sayid单独待会儿么?
You mind giving me and Sayid a minute?

274
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,688
行 知道么 私下谈话总是让我抓狂
Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out

275
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,188
因为他们经常会让我做
cause they usually lead

276
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,928
我不是很理解的事情
to me having to do something I don't quite understand.

277
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,858
我懂你的意思
I'm right there with ya.

278
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:07,768
好 我们在饭厅 有事叫我们
It's fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.

279
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:22,578
他们告诉你 用烙铁烫我的原因了吗?
So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?

280
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,448
他们说是在为你诊断
They said they were trying to diagnose you.

281
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,118
是的
Right.

282
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,320
他们说这是一种测试
They told me it was some sort of test,

283
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,560
而我已经通过了
which they said I passed.

284
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,230
但很明显 我并没有
Clearly, I didn't.

285
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,820
那是什么
What's that?

286
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,520
他们想让你服下这个
They want you to take it.

287
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,490
据他们说 这是药
It's medicine, according to them.

288
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,100
那你认为呢?
What about according to you?

289
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,400
我不知道
I don't know.

290
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,340
你知道吗 在你...
And you know, before when you...

291
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,140
在你谢我救你一命之前 我...
when you thanked me for saving your life, I...

292
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,480
我其实什么也没做 Sayid
I didn't have anything to do with it, Sayid.

293
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
不是我救的你 是他们
I didn't fix you. They did.

294
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,920
我不在乎救我的是谁
I don't care who fixed me.

295
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,020
我在乎的是我信任谁
I only care about who I trust,

296
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,060
所以 如果你说要我吃那粒药 Jack
so if you want me to take that pill, Jack,

297
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,730
我就吃
I'll do it.

298
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,737
等下 你要去哪?
Wait. Where are you going?

299
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,407
赶上Sawyer
Catching up with Sawyer.

300
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:44,707
你从没想过把他带回庙里
So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.

301
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:46,577
不 我不想坐牢 你也不想吧?
No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?

302
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:49,377
- Kate 你们飞机在哪降落的?  - 什么?
- Where did your plane land, Kate?  - What?

303
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:52,087
你和Jack和Hurley坐的那架Ajira飞机...
The Ajira plane that you, Jack and Hurley came in on...

304

- 在哪降落的?  - 我不知道

305
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:58,657
Sun也在那架飞机上 我得找到她
Sun was on that plane, too, and I have to find her.

306
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,657
你觉得他们会告诉你吗?
You think they're gonna tell you?

307
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:03,727
你认为他们会关心你 Sun 或者我们中的谁吗?
You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?

308
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:09,307
那你关心谁 Kate?
Who do you care about, Kate?

309
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:12,247
祝你好运 Jin
Good luck, Jin.

310
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:16,017
你找到Sawyer后... 打算怎么办?

我想我们会一起商量下一步的行动
I guess we'll figure that out together.

嗯 那么...
So, uh...

What happened to your handcuffs?

00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:32,637
我找人砍断了
I cut them off.

I bet they're a really nice couple.

317
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,465
怎么了?
What?

318
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,435
我什么都没说啊
I didn't say anything.

319
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:55,775
你... 你认为他们是故意没来机场接我的?
What, you... you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?

320
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,505
我为什么要那么想?
Why would I think that?

321
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:01,475
那就好 我知道他们不是故意的
Good, because they didn't.

322
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:07,085
到了
This is it.

323
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,665
嗯...
Um...

324
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:23,235
你能陪我一起进去吗?
Will you come in with me?

325
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:25,095
开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

326
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,565
拜托 我... 我只是...
Please, I... I just...

327
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,335
我真的不想独自进去
I really don't want to go up there on my own.

00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:57,315
我丈夫...
My husband...

333
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:06,385
抛弃了我 相信我
He left me. And believe me,

334
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,890
我的确也非常想要这个孩子
I wanted the baby so much,

335
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,890
但是...
But...

336
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,460
我一个人 真的负担不了
I can't do it alone.

337
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,760
对不起
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,130

瞧 我... 我的生活已经...
Look, my... my life is just...

342
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,370
已经一团糟了
a little bit complicated.

343
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,510
她大老远从澳大利亚跑来 可你却连电话都不打一个?
She came all the way from Australia, and you don't call?

344
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,740
哦 我的天哪
Oh, my god.

345
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,650

350
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,530

我很担心你
I was worried about you.

352
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,050
她是怎么了?

353
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,920
- 我... 我想我已经宫缩了  - 什么时候开始的?
- I... I think I'm having contractions.  -  When did they start?

359
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,830
稍等 医生马上就来
Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.

360
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,340
- 怎... 怎么样现在?  - 有什么问题吗?
- What... what's going on?  - Is something wrong?

361
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,070
请问
Excuse me.

362
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,610
请问
Excuse me.

363
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,640

Littleton小姐?
Ms. Littleton?

366
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,920

00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,050
怎么了...
What's happening...

369
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,190
你的小宝宝已经迫不及待 要叫妈妈了
Is that motherature has gotten a little ahead of herself.

370
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,520
你准备好面对他了吗?
Are you ready to have your baby?

371
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,930
- 我... 不好意思 你说什么?!  - 你已经怀孕36周了
- I... I'm sorry. What?!  - You're at 36 weeks.

372
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,760
扩张了3厘米 80%的羊水也破了
3 centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced.

373
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,530
就是说 只要你愿意 今晚你就可以生了
Which means, if you want, You can have your baby tonight.

374
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,530
如果我愿意? 那么 就是说... 你也可以阻止不生?
If I want? So at, you mean... you mean you can stop it then?

375
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,400
应该可以 但是 那要注射大量麻药
Maybe. However, to do that would require number of drugs.

376
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,640
麻药? 那么... 会伤害到宝宝吗?
Drugs? I mean, w... will that hurt the baby?

377
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,270
不 他们相当安全
No, they are perfectly safe.

378
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,480
我只是不想
I just don't want to have to

379
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,450
无谓地 给你注射药物
stick you with needless if I don't have to.

380
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,050
所以 完全取决于你
So is up to you.

381
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,390
我... 我还没准备好
I'm... I'm not ready.

382
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,890
那好 马上给她静脉注射
OK. Let's get her started on the ifedipine drip.

383
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,500
这... 这... 这是什么意思?
Wh... what... what is it?

384
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,700
Margaret 给她做超声波检测
Margaret, let's do her ultrasound.

385
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,570
我想知道发生什么了
I wanna get a piece of what's going on in there.

386
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,040
这... 可能是婴儿的位置不对了
It... it could just mean the baby's out of position.

387
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,010
你... 你... 你在说什么?!
W... w... what are you... what are you saying?!

388
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,040
我... 我的... 孩子发生什么了?!

00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,990
他在那儿 一切都好
There he is. Everything is just fine.

393
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,060
你的孩子就是喜欢乱动
Your boy just likes to move around.

394
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,260
是140 b.p.m
140 b.p.m.

395
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
非常正常
Perfectly normal.

396
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,630
我有一种感觉
I have a feeling

397
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,930
Aaron会是个很不好管的人
And Aaron is gonna be a handful.

398
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,570
现在让我们看看 是否可以把这个降低
Now let'see if we can slow this down.

399
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,740
你做得好极了 母亲
You did great, mommy.

400
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,210
多谢
Thanks.

401
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,235
几天前
A couple days ago,

402
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,645
你问我为什么回到这个岛上
you asked me why I came back to the island.

403
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,415
我要找到Claire
I need to find Claire.

404
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:15,045
我本以为...
I thought...

405
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:18,725
也许如果我能赶上你 你就能帮我
maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me,

406
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:20,725
然后...
and then...

407
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,755
也许我们可以找到他 并把他带回Aaron身边
maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron,

408
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,665
那么所有这些 就不会徒然无功了
then maybe all of this wouldn't have been for nothing.

409
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:35,235
对不起 我不该跟着你
I'm sorry. I never should followed you.

410
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:38,475
什么时候?
Which time?

411
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:49,715
那是你的房子 对吧? 和Juliet的
That was your house, right? With Juliet.

412
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:51,185
是的
Yep.

413
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,555
对不起
I'm sorry.

414
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:56,525
你已经说过了
You already said that.

415
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,155
不...
No...

416
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:00,925
对Juliet说的
For Juliet.

417
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:05,165
如果我没在潜艇上跟着你
If I hadn't come after you on the sub,

418
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:08,565
你们两个就会离开 她也不会死了
then you two would've left, and she would've never died.

419
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:11,435
她的死 不是你的错
It's not your fault she's dead.

420
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,045
我的错
It's mine.

421
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,585
她就坐在那儿
She was sittin' right there,

422
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,545
就是你现在坐的地方
right where you are now,

423
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:25,985
努力离开这个地方
tryin' to leave this place.

424
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,655
我说服她留了下来
And I convinced her to stay.

425
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,565
我让她留在这个岛上
I made her stay on this island

426
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:39,195
因为我不想一个人
'Cause I didn't want to be alone.

427
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:43,725
你能理解的 对吧?
You understand that, right?

428
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:54,305
但是 呃...
But, uh...

429
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,435
但是我觉得 我们有些人
But I think some of us

430
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,435
注定是要孤独的
are meant to be alone.

431
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:09,585
我本打算 向她求婚的
I was gonna ask her to marry me

432
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,675
你大概可以在日落之前 回到庙里的
You can probably make it back to the temple by nightfall.

433
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,375
那是什么?
What's that?

434
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,745
一个棒球
It's a baseball.

435
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,755
对一个需要翻译的人来说
You speak pretty good English

436
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:30,365
你英语说得还真不错
for someone that needs a translator.

437
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:33,265
我们都知道 我不需要翻译
We both know that I don't need a translator.

438
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,665
那为什么你有个翻译
Then why do you have one.

439
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:38,665
因为我必须
Beause I have to remain separate

440
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:42,135
和被我管理的人们 分开
from the people I'm in charge of.

441
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:44,775
事情会简单一些
Makes it easier

442
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,415
即使他们不喜欢 我为他们做的决定
when they don't like the decisions I make for them.

443
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,885
你是谁?
Who are you?

444
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,985
我的名字叫Dogen
My name is Dogen.

445
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:58,555
你是这儿的... 岛上的人?
Are you from here... The island?

446
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,355
我和其他所有人一样 是被带到这来的
I was brought here like everyone else.

447
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:04,355
"带到这儿" 是什么意思?
What do you mean, "brought here"?

448
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,935
你很清楚我的意思
You know exactly what I mean.

449
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:16,675
你没把那药给你朋友 是么?
You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?

450
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:18,445
没有
No.

451
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,345
为什么?
Why not?

452
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:24,615
因为我不知道里面是什么
Because I don'know what's in it.

453
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:26,945
- 它可以消除...  - 感染
- It will eliminate...  - The infection,

454
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:28,885
是的 我知道
