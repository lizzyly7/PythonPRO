《迷失》前情提要
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,024
我来是要告诉你
I'm here to tell you

3
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:07,057
那岛不可能 只让你一个人回去
That the island won't Let you come alone.

4
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:09,006
你们所有人都要回去
All of you have to go back.

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,014
你来就说这个吗
Is that what this is about?

6
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:13,027
太离谱了  你们全疯了
This is insane. You guys are crazy.

7
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,018
- Kate - Jack  别说了
- Kate - Jack, don't!

8
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:18,028
- Sayid  你要去哪儿  -我再也不想跟你们掺和了
- Sayid, where are you going? - I don't want any part of this.

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,000
Jin还在上面
It's Jin!

10
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:29,095
-你怎么知道他没死  -有人知道
- How do you know he's alive?! - There's someone...

11
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:32,000
那人就在洛杉矶
Someone here in Los Angeles.

12
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,035
什么人  是谁
Someone? who?

13
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:34,075
准备告诉我们
The same person that's gonna show us

00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,022
如何回到岛上的那个人
How to get back to the island.

15
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,036

16
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:28,025

21
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:54,087
救救我

救命

23
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,071
救命
Help!

24
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,051
-没事的   -天啊
It's okay. You're okay. Relax. Aah! Oh, god!

25
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:29,026
我的天啊
Oh, god!

26
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:31,017
好吧
Okay.

27
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,074
-天啊    -我们能站起来了
- Oh, my god! - We can stand.

28
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,097
什么
- What?

29
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,039
上帝啊
Oh, my god.

30
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,073
真的发生了
It really happened.

31
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,030
Kate
Kate.

32
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,050
Kate  你能听见我说话吗
Kate, can you hear me?

33
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:20,092
Jack
Jack?

34
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,078
你没事吧
Are you okay?

35
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,076
我们这是...
Are we...

36
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,040
对
Yeah.

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,025
我们回来了
We're back.

38
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,022
发生什么了
What happened?

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,065
46小时前
46 Hours Earlier

40
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:01,085
我记得我说的是一个都不能少
I thought I said all of them.

41
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,089
这么短时间  只能找到这么多人
This is all I could get on short notice.

42
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,003
我看现在就得开始了
Guess it'll have to do for now.

43
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:17,001
好吧  咱们开始吧
All right. Let's get started.

44
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,096
准备好了吗
Shall we?

45
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,064
这是什么地方
What is this place?

46
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:40,076
达摩组织管这里叫灯塔站
The dharma initiative called it the lamp post.

47
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:46,050
他们就是从这里找到的小岛
This is how they found the island.

00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,031
你知道这个地方吗
Did you know about this place?

57
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:16,029
不知道
No.

58
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,003
我不知道
No, I didn't.

00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,015
他说的是真话吗
Is he telling the truth?

60
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,076
很可能是说谎
Probably not.

61
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:31,024
开始吧
Here we go.

62
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,033
好吧
All right.

63
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,001
如果这让你们不知所措  我很抱歉  但是
I apologize if this is confusing, but...

64
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,072
让我们集中精神  好吗
Let's pay attention, yes?

65
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,070
我们现在所处的房间  建造于多年之前
The room we're standing in was constructed years ago

66
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,008
有无可匹敌的大量磁能量经过这里
Over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy.

67
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,078
这些磁场与全世界其它类似的磁场相连接
That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world.

68
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,086
然而建造这所房间的人
The people who built this room, however,

69
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:58,016
-只对一件事感兴趣  -是那个岛吧
- Were only interested in one. - The island.

70
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,008
对  就是那个岛
Yes. the island.

71
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:04,021
他们搜集的证据都证明了此岛的存在
They'd gathered proof that it existed.

72
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:07,037
他们确定它就在某地
They knew it was out there somewhere,

73
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:10,049
但就是找不到具体地点
But they just couldn't find it.

74
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:15,092
后来有位很聪明的家伙建造了这个钟摆
Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum

75
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:19,098
他的理论是  人们应该
On the theoretical notion that they should stop looking

76
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:23,008
停止揣测小岛可能在哪里
For where the island was supposed to be

77
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:27,098
而转向研究它要去哪里
And start looking for where it was going to be.

78
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,037
你说的"去哪里"是什么意思
What do you mean, "where it was going to be"?

79
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,006
这个人的假设是正确的
Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly,

80
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:39,067
已经证明 这个岛在移动
as it turned out, That the island was always moving.

81
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:43,011
要不怎么人们老也搜救不到你们
Why do you think you were never rescued?

82
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,074
虽然这个岛的移动  看似随机
Now while the movements of the island seem random,

83
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,097
但是这人和他的研究组
This man and his team

84
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:52,060
还是创制出了一个方程组
created a series of equations

85
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,080
这个方程组准确度极高
Which tell us,

86
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,089
它能预言
With a high degree of probability,

87
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:04,046
该岛会在哪个时刻  运动到 哪个地点
Where it is going to be at a certain point... In time.

88
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,015
如果说它是扇窗户
Windows, as it were,

89
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,087
那么当它开着的时候  人们就能出去再回来
That while open, provide a route back.

90
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:19,099
很可惜 这扇窗户开不了太长时间
Unfortunately, These windows don't stay open for very long.

91
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:26,057
你们的窗户 36小时之后就关上了
Yours closes... In 36 hours.

92
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,059
不好意思  打断一下
Um, I'm sorry. excuse me.

93
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,092
我怎么听不明白
Am I really hearing this?

94
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,080
这说的都是什么啊
That's what this is about?

95
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,030
你们愿意回到小岛上吗  自愿的吗
You're all going back to the island willingly?

96
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,091
是的  Desmond  你来这儿干吗
Yes. why are you here, desmond?

97
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:45,077
我是来传口信儿的
I came here to deliver a message.

98
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:53,055
你儿子Daniel Faraday 让我来的
Daniel Faraday Your son-- Sent me here.

99
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,063
他想让我告诉你
He wanted me to tell you

100
00:08:55,063 --> 00:09:00,022
他和岛上所有的人  都需要你的帮助
That he and all the people on the island need your help.

101
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,044
他说  只有你才能帮他们
He said that only you could help them.

102
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:04,005
他说的不是Jack  不是Sun  不是Ben
He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben.

103
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,063
-他只说了你  -但是我正在帮忙  亲爱的
- He said you. - But I am helping, dear.

104
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,069
口信儿传完了
Consider the message delivered.

105
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,001
很遗憾地告诉你  Desmond
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, desmond,

106
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,005
你跟这个岛的事儿  还没了断呢
But the island isn't done with you yet.

107
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,054
这个女人浪费我人生中4年的时间
This woman cost me four years of my life--

108
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:24,059
一去不复返的4年啊  就因为你跟我说
Four years that I'll never get back because you told me

109
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,054
说我应该回到那个岛上去
That I was supposed to go to the island!

110
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:30,046
说那才是我该死归宿
That it was my bloody purpose!

111
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,012
你听好了  老兄  你仔仔细细听好了
You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully.

112
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,039
这些人  他们不过是在利用咱们
These people-- they're just usin' us.

113
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,056
他们跟咱们玩猫腻 而我们只是筹码
They're playing some kind of game, And we are just the pieces.

114
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:49,063
无论她让你干什么
Whatever she tells you to do...

115
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:51,036
当她放屁
Ignore it.

116
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,094
你是不是说那岛跟我还没完了
You say the island's not done with me?

117
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:02,048
我告诉你  我跟这岛彻底玩完
Well, I'm done with the island.

118
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,062
Jack
Jack...

119
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:18,009
你手里这个文件夹
The binder in your hands

120
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,088
所有的航线都飞过一些坐标
Shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates

121
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,045
我相信那个岛  就在那些坐标上
Where I believe the island will be

122
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:27,020
从现在开始  有一天多的时间
In little more than a day from now.

123
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,071
有一班商务机从洛杉矶飞往关岛
There's a commercial airliner flying from l.a. to Guam.

124
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:36,003
它将飞过你们的窗户
It's going to go right through your window.

125
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:40,003
Ajira航空公司的3-1-6航班
Ajira Airways, flight 3-1-6.

126
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:43,051
如果希望小岛把你们带回去
Is you have any hope of the island bringing you back,

127
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,087
那就一定要坐这趟航班
It must be that plane.

128
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:49,097
你们所有人都要上飞机
You all need to be on it.

129
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:54,084
一定是这班才可以
It must be that flight.

130
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,077
如果你们 想要返回的话
If you... Want to return,

131
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:06,007
你们必须尽量重现
You need to recreate as best you can

132
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,060
与首次前往时
The circumstances

133
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,021
相同的环境
That brought you there in the first place

134
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:15,066
也就是说  当初谁跟你一块儿回来
That means as many of the same people

135
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,018
谁就跟你一块儿回去
As you are able to bring with you.

136
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:22,068
如果我们没办法说服其他人怎么办
And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us?

137
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,063
如果只有这几个呢
What if we're it?

138
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:30,065
我只能告诉你  结果... 难以预测
All I can tell you is the result would be... Unpredictable.

139
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,060
就这样吗
So that's it?

140
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,068
我们只要登上那班飞机
We just get on that flight,

141
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,029
然后祈祷那样行得通
And we just hope that it works?

142
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,038
就够了吗
That's all?

143
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:42,092
不  还不够  Jack
No, that's not all, jack...

144
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,006
至少对你来说不够
At least, not for you.

145
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:58,058
进来吧
Come on in.

146
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:00,091
Ben和Sun
Ben and sun--

147
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:06,026
只是得知了份内的事 这跟他们无关
Heard what they needed to hear, And this does not concern them.

148
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:11,054
找到了
Oh. here we are.

149
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,087
这是什么
What's this?

150
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:25,028
是John Locke的遗书
It's john locke's suicide note.

151
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:33,024
我... 我不知道
Uh... I, uh... I didn't know.

152
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:35,033
你怎么会知道
Well, why would you?

153
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:40,091
讣告中不适合 提到人们上吊之类的事情  Jack
Obituaries don't see fit To mention when people hang themselves, jack.

154
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,053
他为什么要自杀
Why would he kill himself?

155
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,046
我相信  有很多原因
There are many reasons, I'm sure,

156
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:58,014
但唯一紧要的是...
But the only one that matters is this--

157
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:02,021
他想帮助你们回去
He is going to help you get back.

158
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:05,086
John要做代理人
John is going to be a proxy.

159
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,057
代替者
A substitute.

160
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,034
谁的代替者
A substitute for who?

161
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,067
Jack
Jack...

162
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,080
你觉得是谁
Who do you think?

163
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:23,059
你要竭尽所能的 重现之前那趟航班上的环境
You need to, as best you can, Recreate the conditions of the original flight...

164
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,041
所以你需要 给John一些你父亲的东西
Which is why you need to Give john something of your father's.

165
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,080
你要找到一些属于你父亲的东西
You have to get something that belonged to your father,

166
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,031
然后交给John
And you need to give it to john.

167
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,044
什么
What?

168
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,076
这就是你的当务之急
That's what you have to do.

169
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:47,043
我父亲... 去世了
My father... Is gone.

170
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:50,001
我父亲三年前就死了
My father has been dead for three years.

171
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,006
你要我去...
You want me to...

172
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:55,046
然后交给Locke  他都进棺材了
A-and to give it to locke?! he's in a coffin!

173
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,095
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

174
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:01,058
别去管这有多荒谬
Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is

175
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:06,028
扪心自问
And start asking yourself

176
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:10,062
你到底信不信这能行得通
Whether or not you believe it's going to work.

177
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:17,046
这就称之为天降奇迹  Jack
That's why it's called a leap of faith, jack.

178
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,072
Sun在哪
Where's sun?

179
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:47,051
她走了
She left.

180
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,025
Locke呢
And locke?

181
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:52,033
我是说...他的尸体呢  灵柩呢
I mean... his body? the coffin?

182
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,040
我让一个朋友照看它
I have a friend looking after it.

183
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,047
去机场的路上我去取
I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.

184
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:09,013
-Jack  她跟你说了什么  -没什么
- What did she say to you, jack? - nothing that matters.

185
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,029
她是谁
Who is she?

186
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:13,043
她为什么要...帮助我们
Why is she... helping us?

187
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,015
她怎么会知道这一切
How does she know all this?

188
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:23,007
圣徒多马
Thomas the apostle

189
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:27,020
当耶稣想回到犹太时
When jesus wanted to return to judea,

190
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,051
在得知他可能会在当地被谋杀后
Knowing that he would probably be murdered there,

191
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:32,091
多马对其他人说
Thomas said to the others,

192
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:36,056
"让我们随之而去吧  我们则与之同亡"
"let us also go, that we might die with him."

193
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:40,046
但多马并未因此出名
But thomas was not remembered for this bravery.

194
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:43,079
而是由于随后的
His claim to fame came later...

195
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,031
拒绝承认转世重生的理论
When he refused to acknowledge the resurrection.

196
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,071
他就是无法认同这种想法
He just couldn't wrap his mind around it.

197
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:54,025
故事似曾相识
The story goes...

198
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:57,004
他不得不触碰耶稣的伤口
That he needed to touch jesus' wounds

199
00:15:57,004 --> 00:16:00,061
来说服自己
To be convinced.

200
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,051
他做到了吗
So was he?

201
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:06,056
当然做到了
Of course he was.

202
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:11,032
我们迟早都要被说服的  Jack
We're all convinced sooner or later, jack.

203
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,076
你要去哪
Where are you going?

204
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:25,089
我答应过一个老朋友
Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine--

205
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,075
只是一些琐碎事情要处理
Just a loose end that needs tying up.

206
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:33,029
机场见  Jack
See you at the airport, jack.

207
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:15,008
你好
Hello?

208
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:18,000
对  就是我
Yeah, this is him.

209
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,013
他怎么了
He did what?

210
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:23,018
这是他第四次逃跑了
This is the fourth time he's left.

211
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,062
他必须要遵守规定
He's gotta follow the rules,

212
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:26,018
否则就要被转到全天候监视区
Or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.

213
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,077
是  我知道
Yeah, I understand.

214
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:31,001
现在  女士们  先生们
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

215
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:35,046
这就是我胆小的兔子
Here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!

216
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:41,015
你好  Ray
Hey, ray.

217
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:42,056
-你好  Jack  -下面
- Hey, jack. - As for my next trick,

218
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:44,001
我需要有人挑选一张卡片
I need someone to pick a card.

219
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,096
-想离开这里吗  -求之不得
- Wanna get out of here? - The sooner the better.

220
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:51,093
请选一张  看一看
Would you please pick one? look at it. mm-hmm.

221
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,080
你能告诉我这次为什么离开吗  Ray
You wanna tell me why you took off this time, ray?

222
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,004
我还需要回答吗
Do I really need to answer that?

223
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:03,051
至少告诉我你打算去哪儿
Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?

224
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,045
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

225
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:07,095
去哪儿也比这儿强
Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.

226
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,082
-你还打了包吗  -当然
- You packed a bag? - of course I did.

227
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,033
之前有一次  我其实已经成功逃脱了
One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away.

228
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,098
他们也无法找到我
They won't ever find me either.

229
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:31,023
再这样的话  他们就要把你赶出去了  Ray
Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, ray.

230
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,039
但是不做这个  我该干什么
But what would I do without my magic shows?

231
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:42,003
我来帮你把东西拿出来  爷爷
Let me help you unpack, granddad.

232
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,043
你好吗  孩子
So how are you, kiddo?

233
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:46,009
遇见真命天女了吗
You seeing anyone special?

234
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,080
你那次
Whatever happened

235
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,086
带来的那个女孩怎么样了
To the girl that you brought by with you that time?

236
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,091
就是那位满脸雀斑的美女
The pretty one with all the freckles?

237
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,021
她叫什么
What was her name?

238
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,015
Kate
Kate.

239
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,017
我们没在一起了
We're not together anymore.

240
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,009
好吧  乐观一点
Well, look at the bright side--

241
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,001
多来看看我
More time to come visit me.

242
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:11,012
我会的  爷爷  放心吧  但是...
I'd love to, granddad. I really would, but...

243
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:13,017
我想我或许...
I think I might be...

244
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:16,009
或许会离开一阵子
Might be going away for a while.

245
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,063
"离开"是去哪里
Where's "away" exactly?

246
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:21,026
比这儿好的地方
Somewhere better than here.

247
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,061
说的好
touche.

248
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,052
这些是你的吗  爷爷
Are these yours, granddad?

249
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,029
不
No.

250
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,076
那些是你父亲的
Those were your father's.

251
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:48,015
他死后  你妈妈寄给我一包他的遗物
Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died.

252
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:53,017
一定是我急于逃走给弄混了
Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.

253
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,024
那些鞋子
These shoes...

254
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,052
我可以带走吗
Can I take them?

255
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:05,016
可以
Be my guest.

256
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,086
Kate
Kate?

257
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,018
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

258
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,074
你还打算回岛上去吗
Are you still going back to the island?

259
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:41,053
是的
Yeah.

260
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:43,092
是的  我想我要回去的
Yeah, I think I am.

261
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,081
那我和你一起走
Then I'm going with you.

262
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,028
Kate
Kate...

263
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:57,069
-发生什么了  Aaron在哪  -别问
What happened? where's aaron? where-- no, don't ask questions.

264
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:04,020
如果你想让我一起走
If you want me to go with you...

265
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,083
就别再问我这个问题 别再问起Aaron
You'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about aaron.

266
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,094
明白吗  Jack
Do you understand, jack?

267
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:14,094
明白了
Yes.

268
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:18,055
谢谢
Thank you.

269
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:48,057
早
Morning.

270
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:51,033
早
Morning.

271
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:55,025
我给你煮了咖啡  那儿有橙汁
Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice.

272
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:04,067
你还是牛奶和两块糖吗
You still like milk and two sugars?

273
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:08,011
是的
Yeah, sure.

274
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:19,038
那些在岛上不适用
Those don't make much sense for the island.

275
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,017
你还是考虑徒步旅行靴吧
You might want to consider hiking boots.

276
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,061
那些都是我父亲的
Those were my father's.

277
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:29,068
当我去悉尼接回他的尸体时
When I went to pick up his body in sydney,

278
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:31,072
我父亲没有什么好鞋
My dad didn't have any nice shoes.

279
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,089
我母亲想我一回到洛杉矶 就进行葬礼
My mother wanted to have the funeral Soon as I landed back in l.a.

280
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,089
但是我想  谁会看他的脚呢
But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet?

281
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,094
然后我就带了这些白色老式网球鞋
And so i-i had these old white tennis shoes,

282
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:46,019
我只说句  给他穿上这双吧
And I just said, "use these. put these on him."

283
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:50,095
因为他对于我来说  不如一双漂亮的鞋子
'cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me.

284
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,077
或者时间会带走这一切
Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.

285
00:23:54,077 --> 00:23:57,045
那为什么你不扔掉它们呢
So why don't you get rid of 'em?

286
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:02,027
为什么还留着一些让你伤心的东西呢
Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?

287
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,012
去接吧
Go ahead.

288
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,065
我
I...

289
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:17,081
我们机场见  好吗
I'll see you at the airport, okay?

290
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,097
-你好  -你好  Jack  你在吗
-Hello? -hello, jack. are you there?

291
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:30,006
一切都还好吗
Yeah. yeah, what's u is everything all right?

292
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:34,037
听着  我们时间不够  我出车祸了
Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked,

293
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,000
我要你
And I need you

294
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,020
带上Locke的尸体去机场
To pick up locke's body and take it to the airport.

295
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,082
棺材在西蒙的卖肉铺
The coffin is at simon's butcher shop,

296
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:45,028
Grand和Hayes的街角
Corner of grand and hayes.

297
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,033
为什么  你怎么了
Why? wh-what's happened to you?

298
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,070
就这样做吧
Just do it. please.

299
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,049
你是Jill吗  Ben让我来的
Are you jill? ben sent me.

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:17,018
我知道你是谁  Shephard医生  进来吧
I know who you are, dr. shephard. come on in.

301
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:28,003
包里是什么
What's in the bag?

302
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:30,028
抱歉
Sorry.

303
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,054
Ben说把货车给你
Ben said to give you the van.

304
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:36,006
我把车开过来  等我5分钟
I gotta pull it around back. give me about five minutes.

305
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:50,049
不管你在哪  John
Wherever you are, john...

306
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,048
看到我在做的事
You must be laughing your ass off

307
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:56,016
你肯定要笑疯了
That I'm actually doing this.

308
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:01,027
因为这个
