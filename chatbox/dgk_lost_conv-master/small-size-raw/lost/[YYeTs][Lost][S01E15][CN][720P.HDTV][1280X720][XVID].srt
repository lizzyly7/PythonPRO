大家退后一点 好吗?
Everybody needs to back off, okay?

26
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:32,005
让她呼吸点新鲜空气
Just give her some air.

那你记得什么?
What do you remember?

47
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:54,020

00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:58,020
从悉尼飞往洛杉矶
...um, flying to LA from Sydney.

49
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:04,026
Claire...

50
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:07,010
大家都在那架飞机上
We were all on that plane.

51
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:11,028
然后坠机了 掉在这个岛上
It crashed here, on this island.

52
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,060
这差不多是一个月前的事了
That was almost a month ago.

53
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:20,047
-不 我就要...  -你孩子没事儿
-No! I'm due...  -Your baby's fine.

54
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:23,019
他还会踢 一切都很正常
He's kicking. Everything's normal.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,031
好吗?
Okay?

56
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:32,045
如果已经有一个月了 那为什么还没人来救我们?
Well, if it's been a month, then why hasn't somebody come to get us?

57
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:42,089
你知道发生什么事了?

58
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,038
我不知道

59
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,028
她还好吧

60
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,020
那女孩?

61
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,090
是的 我想应该没事

62
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:56,005
孩子呢?

63
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:01,080
我相信孩子也没事儿

64
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,070
你认为她是逃出来的吗?
You think she escaped?

65
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:18,086
你一直在我旁边 Boone你知道多少 我也就知道多少
You were right beside me, Boone. You know as much as I do.

66
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,095
她从哪儿来的?
But where'd she come from?

67
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,087
我意思是 我们都已经去过丛林深处了
I mean, we were out pretty deep.

68
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,041
那边根本没东西
Nothing's out there.

69
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,086
她没提到Ethan?
She didn't say anything about Ethan?

70
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,096
很明显 她根本不记得Ethan了
She doesn't even remember Ethan.

71
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,042
那家伙假装是我们中的一员
The guy pretends to be one of us

72
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,038
他把她拖进丛林里面差不多两个星期了
he drags her into the jungle for almost two weeks.

73
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,079
她会不记得他?
She doesn't remember him?

74
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,099
显然不记得
Apparently.

75
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,048
你觉得他在周围?
You think he's around?

76
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,016
我当然希望不了
I sure hope not.

77
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,044
Claire

78
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,055
这是你的日记
Here's your journal.

79
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:57,070
或许会有些帮助
It might help.

80
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,083
还有这是你睡觉的地方
And this is where you sleep.

81
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,064
很舒适 是吧?
It's quite cozy, isn't it?

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,066
当他..Ethan..
When he, Ethan...

83
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:17,028
当他把你带走的时候...
...when he took you away

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,084
也把我带走了
he took me too.

85
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,051
大伙都来追我们
The others came after us.

86
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:25,058
他们把我救回来了 但你...
They got me back. But you...

87
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:28,027
你却不见了
You were gone.

88
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:33,012
他..Ethan..是谁?
Who is he? Ethan?

89
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:37,035
Ethan...

90
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,008
Ethan是个坏人
Ethan's the bad guy.

91
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:46,054
所以那时.... 我们是在一起的
So we were together when...

92
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,061
是的
Yeah.

93
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,085
他为什么要放了你?
Well, why did he leave you?

94
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:58,025
这事我们明天早上再谈吧?!
Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning?

95
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,018
你今天经历了够多了
You've had enough for one day.

96
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,077
-我睡不着  -哦
-I won't be sleeping.  -Oh...

97
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,048
我真是幸运
lucky for me.

98
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:08,031
我也不是个爱睡觉的家伙
Not much of a sleeper myself.

99
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,076
终于有个人陪我过夜了
Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.

100

但是我们还没吸完
But we're not out yet.

107
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,085
该享受的时候就享受 我的朋友
Carpe diem, my friend.

108
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,055
听着 把你的法语留给 那些懂得欣赏的人听吧
Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.

109
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,096
是拉丁语 Tommy
Latin, Tommy.

110
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,015
是拉丁语
It's Latin.

111
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,087
那么 这句是拉丁文吗..

"我有一大堆的钱  这样我们就能搞到很多非法药物"?

不
No

114
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,079
如果你还不想戒毒的话
 I suppose you ought to clean up then.

115

那么是时候该让你工作了
It's time to put you to work.

116

120
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,050
他老爸绝对是个有钱人 朋友

121
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:29,064
你哪里弄来这种老让我吃惊的消息 Tommy
How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me. Tommy

准备恋爱吧 来自传说中的驱轴摇滚乐团的Charlie先生?

不要再给我买酒喝了
I demand you stop buying me more drinks.

我是一个有道德的男人
I'm a man of high moral standing.

127
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:01,014
你那招勾引我回家的方法不管用的
Your obvious plan to take me home and ravish me will not work.

128
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,010
你们这群狐狸精
Saucy sirens.

129
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,049
我信奉一夫一妻制
I believe in monogamy.

130
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,054
我可不会像咖喱一样被人共享
I will not be shared like a common curry.

131
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:09,014
-我们的用意真有那么明显么?  -太明显了
-Are we that obvious?  -Dreadfully.

132
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,082
你们称自己为淑女? 简 奥斯丁定会感到羞耻
Call yourself ladies. Jane Austen would be ashamed.

133
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,097
那女孩怀孕了...就快生了
The girl is pregnant.Very pregnant.

134
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,053
那拿到我们应该相信她从他手里逃出来了?
Are we supposed to believe that she escaped from him?

135
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,095
-你什么意思?  -Ethan混入到我们当中
-What're you getting at?  -Ethan infiltrated us.

136
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:31,016
不管他是谁 来自什么地方
Whoever he is and wherever he comes from

137
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:33,000
他很聪明
he's intelligent.

138
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,076
谁能肯定Claire不是他派来的?
Who's to say he didn't even send Claire?

139
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:37,093
-你脑子有毛病啊 老兄  -Charlie 冷静
-You're off your head, mate.  -Charlie. Calm down.

140
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,018
这有点过分了 Sayid
That's a stretch, Sayid.

141
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,054
你倒是告诉我 医生 你以前诊断的有几个是真正的失忆症
Tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia?

142
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,001
有几个是这种选择性失忆?!
And such a selective brand of it?

143
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,079
是 是很少 但她经历过严重的创伤
Okay. It's rare. But she's been through a major trauma.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,008
记忆回到坠机前是有可能的
It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,021
恢复记忆的机会有多少?
And the chances of that memory returning?

146
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,025
我不知道
I don't know.

147
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,082
知道吗? 随你们怎么谈论Claire吧
You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want.

148
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,055
我要过去陪陪她
I'm actually gonna spend time with her.

149
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:05,013
我感觉她还有些烦躁
I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.

150
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,015
Jin!

151
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,049
你回山洞去?
You heading back to the caves?

152
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,033
你好

153
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,051
你好

154
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,062
一块儿走更安全 对吧?
Safety in numbers, right?

155
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:22,006
当然...
Of course...

156
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,099
你根本不知道我在说什么
you have no idea what I'm talking about.

157
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,014
没有被卷入周围
How nice it must be to not be involved

158
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:31,001
一轮一轮的疯狂事多么好啊
in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn.

159
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,079
这样真得很棒
It's quite beautiful really.

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,062
你只要照顾你的妻子
You take care of your wife.

161
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,042
其他的都是别人的事了
Everything else is someone else's problem.

162
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,082
不必参与任何决策
No need to be involved in the decision-making process.

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,046
不必对付能捍动大树的巨兽
No tree-shaking behemoths

164
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,084
不必研究法国人的求救信号
French transmissions

165
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,028
无知即是快乐
Just sweet bloody ignorance.

166
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,010
你知不知道你有多么的幸运?
You don't know how lucky you are,you know?

167
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:52,023
感觉一定很好 早上醒来 然后...
Must be nice. You wake up and...

168
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,059
怎么了?
What?

169
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,084
Charlie 我要她回来
Charlie, I want her back.

170
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,061
什么?我...
What? I...

171
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:23,014
我要你把她带回来
I want you to bring her back.

172
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,050
你对她做了什么?
What did you do to her?

173
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,050
你做过什么?!
What did you do?

174
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,064
你把她带到这儿
You bring her here.

175
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,016
如果你不乖乖照办的话
If you don't

176
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,063
我就杀了他们中的一个
I'm going to kill one of them.

177
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,068
明天日落前你还没把她带来的话
and then if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow

178
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,055
我就再杀一个...
I'll kill another...

179
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:51,004
再一个...
And another.

180
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,034
再一个
And another.

181
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,060
一天一个
One every day.

182
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:59,007
然后, Charlie...
And, Charlie...

183
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:02,059
我会最后一个杀你
I'll kill you last.

184
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,049
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?

185
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,094
我们去把他宰了
We go out and we bloody kill him.

186
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:24,000
冷静 Charlie 我们不想让其它人感到不安
Calm down. Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset.

187
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,085
管他们的 他现在就在那儿 Locke
Forget them. He's out there right now. Locke

188
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,097
我觉得他说的没错
I think he's right.

189
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:31,054
那家伙威胁要杀掉我们中的一个 除非我们把Claire带过去
The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire.

190
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:34,019
那怎么办 难道我们就等着那一刻的到来吗?
and what? We just wait for that to happen?

191
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,058
我们以前跟踪过他 就一定能再跟踪一次
We tracked him once before. We can track him again.

192
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,090
你俩好像都忘了上次跟踪他的下场了吧
You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out.

193
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,030
他把你揍得半死
He bested you. Physically.

194
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,040
还把你吊在树上
He hung you from a tree.

195
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,000
徒手冲进丛林是搞不定他的
Running into the jungle unarmed is not gonna get the job done.

196
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,021
那怎么才能搞定他?
So, what does get it done?

197
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:49,020
我们封锁营地 把这件事有选择性的告诉小部分人
We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat

198
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:51,027
让他们分别在这儿和山洞那边放哨
we post them as sentries here and at the caves.

199
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,025
有选择性的告诉小部分人?
"Tell a select few"?

200
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:58,016
他说得出做得到 如果出了事 责任完全在我们
He does what he says he's gonna do, and that blood's on our hands.

201
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:03,023
好 Jack 那就告诉每个人
Okay, Jack, we tell everyone.

202
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:06,042
但你要是想保护他们  你就得考虑如何加强防御
But you wanna protect them, you need to start thinking defense.

203
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:09,041
大伙都撤离海滩 搬到山洞去
We move everybody off the beach back up into the caves.

204
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,048
要是Ethan不只一个人怎么办?
What if Ethan isn't alone?

205
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,096
也许他故意这样威胁我们...
What if he delivered his threat so that

206
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,016
让大家成为入瓮之鳖
we would gather like sheep to the slaughter

207
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:21,052
乖乖地聚在一起, 他们就能把我们一网打尽?
in a confined space where they could roll in and take us all in one fell swoop?

208
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,061
那好 John
Okay, John.

209
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:27,001
这么说来 你一定有好主意了 那么...
I mean, obviously you have a plan, so...

210
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:29,028
说来听听
let's hear it.

211
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,088
你知道发生什么事了吗?

212
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,003
发生什么事?

213
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,045
我怎么会知道?

214
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,088
或许其它人知道

215
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,040
其它人?

216
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,021
我被袭击都是因为他们干的好事

217
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,045
大伙都在避着我
The others are avoiding me.

218
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,055
-什么?  -没人愿意和我说话
-Sorry?  -No one will talk to me.

219
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:04,073
你知道 感觉就像发生了什么事
You know, it just feels like something's going on.

220
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,068
记起什么事了吗?
Anything coming back?

221
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,001
坠机后的事 都记不得了
After the crash, no.

222
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:14,041
反正这些事还是忘掉的好
Some of this stuff is probably better forgotten anyway

223
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,015
恩 我不知道你怎样
I don't know about you

224
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:19,056
但我们其他人都过得很开心
but the rest of us been having a wonderful time.

225
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:22,083
我们甚至建了个高尔夫球场
We even built a golf course.

226
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:29,095
你..你确定没发生什么事
You sure there's nothing going on?

227
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,078
当然
Absolutely.

228
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,037
好的
Okay.

229
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:46,081
你很自恋 是不是?
You're quite enamored of yourself,aren't you?

230
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:50,035
听着 Lucy 我知道这是我们的第一次约会 你应该表现得淑女一些
Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date, and you need to appear demure

231
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:54,046
但你知道 要是你想邀我和你上床 不必说"喝茶"
but if you want to invite me for sex,don't say "tea,"

232
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,003
说"做爱"
say "sex."

233
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,032
你到底喝不喝茶?
Do you want tea or not?

234
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,084
-来一杯  -很好
-I'd love some.  -Brilliant.

235
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,028
你老爸在哪儿?
So where is the old man?

236
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,083
我不知道
I don't know.

237
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:07,098
我想他是去斯劳镇收购某家造纸厂去了
I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.

238
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:12,003
是这样 你俩相处的还算融洽吧?
Oh, yeah? You two get on?

239
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,085
事实上 我爸是个很酷的人
Dad's quite cool, actually.

240
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,007
当我告诉他我在和一个如假包换的摇滚明星约会时
He was rather proud when...

241
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:20,012
他还觉得很自豪
I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.

242
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:27,030
那是温斯顿 邱吉尔的东西
It was Winston Churchill's.

243
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:32,046
爸爸老收集大英帝国将领的各种垃圾东西
Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire.

244
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,083
你应该见见他了
Hey, you should meet him.

245
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:36,059
温斯顿? 不 谢谢 我听说他都发霉了
Winston? No, thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.

246
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,062
我爸爸
My father.

247
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:40,036
他明天回来
He's coming back tomorrow.

248
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,034
你应该来吃晚饭
You should come around for dinner.

249
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,094
我非常乐意
I'd love to.

250
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,037
好极了
Excellent.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,026
你看来饿了
You look hungry.

252
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,001
谢谢
Thanks.

253
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,074
Locke告诉我们出什么事了
Locke told us what happened.

254
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:20,010
你觉得他要回她干什么?
Why do you think he wants her back?

255
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,088
我不知道
I don't know.

256
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:31,040
也许该是用你脖子上那把钥匙的时候了
Maybe it's time you used that key you've been wearing around your neck.

257
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,062
那长官的箱子里面有4把9毫米的枪
There are four 9-millimeters in the marshal's case...

258
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:35,063
哦-哦 不
Uh-uh. No.

259
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,084
我把枪分给大家
I hand them out

260
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,093
一有风吹草动 人们就会受到惊吓
someone hears something out n the jungle, gets scared...

261
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:40,009
射中自己人的机率
Chance of shooting each other

262
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,084
要比击中他的概率高多了
is higher than shooting him.

263
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,041
我们这里锋利的刀子已经不多了 Jack
We're beyond sharpening knives. Jack

264
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,085
我不会把枪分给那些未经过训练的人
I'm not putting guns in untrained hands.

265
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:57,018
试试看!
Trip it.

266
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,086
还不错
Not bad.

267
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,007
周围放四个就可以搞定了
Four of these around the perimeter will do the job.

268
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,048
我每隔20米就生一堆火
I have fires prepared at 20-meter intervals.

269
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,045
干得好
Excellent.

270
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,027
有些人自愿为大伙站岗
Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty

271
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:09,006
我让他们轮流换班
I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.

272
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:11,047
算我一个
I'll take a shift.

273
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:13,055
好的
Okay.

274
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,083
当然好 就靠你了 Boone
Absolutely. We're counting on you. Boone

275
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,078
或许我们应该把她转移走
Maybe we should move her.

276
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,019
在这儿比较安全
She's safer here.

277
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,051
那座山怎么样?
What about the mountain?

278
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,094
-可能还有其它的山洞  -她在这儿更安全 Charlie
-There could be another cave.  -She's safer here. Charlie

279
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:34,061
-没人是安全的!  -嘿
-Nobody's safe!  -Hey.

280
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,071
Clare被他带走是我的错
It's my fault he took her

281
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:39,056
是我的责任 我应该照顾好她的 我应该...
I was responsible.I should've taken care of her.I should've...

282
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:45,085
Charlie 她不会有事的 好吗?
Charlie, nothing's gonna happen to her. Okay?

283
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,099
恩 好的
Yeah. Okay.

284
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:03,005
Charlie 我想我的宝贝女儿绝对同意
Well,Charlie I think my daughter would agree that

285
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:07,039
你是和我们一块儿共进晚餐的 给人印象最深的一个
you are the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.

286
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,011
您太过讲了 先生
My condolences, sir.

287
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,064
我不知道Lucy有没跟你提过
I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you

288
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,002
我曾经也参加过乐队
but I was in a band once, you know.

289
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,068
乐队名叫"新教革命"
They were called The "Protestant Reformation".

290
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,044
是的..噢 很糟 是吧?
Yes. Ouch! Dreadful,huh?

291
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,066
你后来放弃了?
You gave it up, then?

292
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,059
那时我结婚了 Lucy也即将出生
Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way.

293
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,036
他妈妈--上帝保佑她--要我再试试
Her mum, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying,

294
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:31,022
但我想更实际一些
but I always wanted to be more practical.

295
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:33,006
或者说 更有责任感一些
Responsible, I guess.

296
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,061
你也知道 一个男人得养家 顾家
You know, a man has to provide,take care of his family.

297
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,077
得考虑到将来
A man has to think about the future.

298
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,000
当然还有一点 你的乐队糟糕透了
And, of course, your band was bloody awful.

299
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,059
是 那倒也是 不过那不重要
Yes, there was that too. Small detail.

300
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,000
那么 你们正在筹划新专集吗 Charlie?
So, are you working on a new album,Charlie?

301
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,056
我们现在关系不太融洽
We're in a bit of a hiatus right now.

302
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:58,077
Liam 我兄弟 刚生了个女儿 所以 你知道 我们...
Liam, my brother, just had a daughter.So, you know,..

303
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,049
先休息一阵儿
we're taking some time off.

304
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,071
事实上休息很长一段时间了
Quite a lot of time off actually

305
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:12,031
我们分开差不多有一年了
It's been a year since we were together.

Liam和我其实联系并不多
Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch,

308
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:25,039
再加上我们之间还有些争执...

323
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,074
偷些有价值的东西 然后我去卖

324
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,010
等到那可怜家伙意识到东西丢了
By the time the poor hopeless bird realizes it's missing,

325
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,064
她也不会想到是你这位摇滚明星Charlie Pace

326
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:23,019
干出这种偷鸡摸狗的事

327
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,066
生活就还能继续了
and the bloody party continues.

他怎么过的我们这关?
How did he get past us?

我以为他们已经把周围布置得天衣无缝了
I thought those guys had the full-on perimeter set up.

他从水里上来的
He came in from the water.

348
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,034
你肯定那不是个意外?

349
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:24,080
我是说 或许那家伙只是溺水了什么的
I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something

350

他的脖子被折断了 连同他的双臂 所有手指骨...
His neck was broken, both his arms, all bones in his fingers...

抱歉我一直叫你Steve

我想该说"阿门"了吧
Um... Amen, I guess.

360
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,063
我不知道该如何收尾
I don't know how to end these.

00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:36,062
你好
Hi. Um...

362

告诉我什么?
Told me what?

为什么你要骗我?!
Why did you lie to me?

371

恩 听着....
Okay, look...

372
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,059
是吗 你还有什么没告诉我?!

我只是觉得以你的记忆力没有什么你能做所的
I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything that you could do.

没有什么我能做的?!!
Nothing I could do?

375
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,082
你干吗老让我蒙在鼓里 Charlie?
Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie?

376
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:15,007
我已经失去记忆了
I'm already in the dark.

377

我有衬衣...

好 听着  我知道你又要抗议了

402

但要是没这样东西 别人就不会尊敬你
but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these.

403
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,047
哦  Lucy

404

417
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:47,019
你这问题是白问 Jack
Rhetorical, Jack.

418
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,079
昨晚发生的事  今晚还是一样会发生
Same thing happens tonight happened last night.

419
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,058
你觉得你能否追踪到他?
You think you can track him?

420
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,047
什么?再说一遍?
What, I'm sorry?

421
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:54,045
我们知道他在哪儿袭击Jin和Charlie
We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie.

422
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,041
你觉得你能不能追踪到他?
Do you think you could pick up the trail?

423
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,037
恩 可能吧 但我不会这么做
Maybe, but I wouldn't.

424
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:00,057
你不会这么做?
You wouldn't?

425
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,092
Jack  我不是冷血动物
Jack, I'm not a cold man.

426
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,074
我同样为大家的损失感到痛心
I feel for the loss of one of our own.

427
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,075
但基本原则没有改变
But nothing fundamental's changed.

428
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:10,097
不管他是谁 从哪里来 我们都在Ethan的地盘上
Whoever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf.

429
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:12,049
他占有优势
He has the advantage.

430
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,068
对他而言  我们只不过是一群...
To him we're nothing more than a bunch of

431
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:17,098
拿着尖木棍 吓破了胆的白痴
scared idiots with sharp sticks.

432
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:23,014
要是我说我有办法把优势夺回来呢?
What if I told you that I had a way to get the advantage back?

433
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:26,082
那我就要问那是什么方法了 Jack?
Then I would ask, "What way might that be?" Jack?

434
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:57,010
为什么 医生 你一直瞒着我们
Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.

435
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,042
我想你应该知道怎么用这东西吧
I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these.

436
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,043
你们疯了?
Are you insane?

437
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,014
这是我们最好的机会了 Charlie
It's the best chance we have.Charlie

438
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,027
没门儿
No bloody way.

439
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:28,027
如果我们想要抓住Ethan 就得想办法把他引出来
If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him.

440
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:30,097
唯一的方法就是把他想要的东西给他
and the only way to do that is by giving him what he wants.

441
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,046
你根本不知道自己在讲什么
You have no idea what you talking about

442
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,083
这家伙...他会把你们都杀了的
This guy...he will kill all of you.

443
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:36,092
-你们无法保护自己  -Charlie
-You can't protect yourself...  -Charlie

444
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:39,017
不用你替我说话
I can talk for myself

445
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:43,076
Claire 他们要把你作诱饵
Claire They want to use you as bait.

446
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,074
我不记得Ethan
I don't remember Ethan.

447
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,045
我也不记得他对我做过什么
I don't remember what he did to me.

448
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:52,061
但要是我能够阻止他伤害其它人
But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else,

449
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:55,026
我就必须真么做
I have to do that.

450
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,015
我和你们一块儿去 你说有四把枪
I'm coming with you. You said there were four guns.

451
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,030
你用过枪吗 Charlie?
You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?

452
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,082
好了 我们动手吧
All right, we should do this.

453
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,021
让我们想个策略
Let's figure out a game plan.

454
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:17,012
好的 Sayid 军人
All right, Sayid, soldier.

他本可以告诉我们他从哪儿来的

他要Claire做什么 为什么要把她带走

00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,076
-Lucy 我不是故意要...  -哦 你是故意的 Charlie

我知道你为什么假装喜欢我了
I get why you pretended to like me.

538
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,072
我知道你为什么要偷...
I understand why you stole,

539
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:12,070
因为你是个瘾君子
because you're a junkie,

540
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:19,011
但我不明白你为什么要接那份工作
but I don't understand why you took the job.

541
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:23,045
你为什么要接那份工作 Charlie?
