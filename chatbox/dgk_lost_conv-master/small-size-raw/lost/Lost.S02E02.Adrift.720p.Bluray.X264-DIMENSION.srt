-We have to fire the flare.  -It doesn't make...

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,005
听着  你到底是把枪给我
Look, are you gonna give me the damn gun,

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:23,044
还是逼我去抢?
or am I gonna have to take it?

00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:27,035
我的天啊
Please, God!

-Walt  -救我  爸爸
-Walt!  -Help me, Dad!

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,063
不  不  不
No, no, no...

18
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,076
停下
Stop it!

19
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:10,088
停下  我们不能这么做
Stop it! We can't!

20
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:18,052
Locke发现了一个...
Locke found a...

21
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:21,052
在地下发现了一个舱门
a hatch in the ground.

22
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,086
太阳在3小时内就会升起
The sun comes up in three hours

23
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,040
我们一定会在这里看见那一刻的
and we're all gonna see that happen.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,070
我们大家今晚一起呆在这儿  好么?
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?Together.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,067
-John  你在干什么?  -我要下去
-John, what are you doing?  -I'm going in.

26
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:36,020
不管你反不反对  Locke还是准备下到那里面去
Locke's going into that thing,whether you like it or not.

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,057
我要下到舱门里去
I'm going to the hatch.

28
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,005
一起生  单独死  对么?
Live together, die alone, right?

29
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,050
是的
Right.

30
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:55,056
John  我想下面好像有东西
John! I think there's something down here!

31
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:11,099

Walt

第二季 第二集

54
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,086
-Walt在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where's Walt?  -I don't know.

55
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,053
-他在哪儿?  -我不知道
-Where is he?  -I don't know!

56
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,035
我儿子到底在哪儿?
Where the hell is my son?

57
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:03,019
Walt

58
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:10,003
你怎么伤到腿的?
How'd you hurt your leg?

59
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:13,032
被一辆车撞了
Got hit by a car.

60
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,090
恩
Yeah.

61
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,082
那么这是你前妻发来的文件
So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over...

62
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:21,008
她不是我的前妻  她是...
She's not my ex-wife, man.

63
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,076
她只是Walt的母亲
She's just Walt's mother.

64
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,083
她  呃...
She...

65
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,098
Susan...她刚刚和她的男朋友在罗马找到工作
Susan, she just got a job in Rome with her boyfriend.

66
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,059
他们想让Walt跟他们在一起
They want to take Walt with them.

67
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,093
别担心  我会尽力帮助你的  Dylan先生
Don't worry, I'm gonna take real good care of you, Mr Dylan.

68
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:35,001
是Dawson
Dawson.

69
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,018
哦  是的  对不起  Dawson
Right. Sorry. Dawson.

70
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:41,069
那么她的男朋友...是叫Brian Porter么?
So this boyfriend,this is this guy Brian Porter?

71
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,008
是的  怎么了?  上面写了什么?
Yeah. Why? What's it say?

72
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,031
看起来好像Susan
It seems that Susan

73
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:49,031
想让你放弃作为Walt的父亲的权力
wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father

74
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,081
这样Porter先生就能领养他了
so that Mr Porter can adopt him.

75
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,067
她想让我放弃孩子?
She wants me to sign my son away?

76
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,091
是的  这是他们想领养你的孩子的唯一途径
It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah.

77
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,093
听着  如果你签了这个文件  从法律上来说
Listen, if you sign this document, legally

78
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:02,067
他对你来说就和在街上遇到的其它孩子没什么区别了
he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street.

79
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:07,008
你等于放弃了你所有作为父亲的权力
You'd be giving up your paternal rights.All of them.

80
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,061
那么我能阻止她离开么?
So then, can I stop her from going?

81
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,088
我想我们能申请一个禁令
Well,I guess we could file an injunction

82
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,056
那么她就不能离开这座城市了 但是...
so she couldn't leave the city,but...

83
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:16,017
对  好的
Yeah, that. That.

84
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,085
我就要那么做
I want to do that.

85
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,044
好的
Right.

86
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:23,058
Dawson先生
Mr Dawson,

87
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:26,067
你这么辛苦得赶来让我知道了
the fact that you came in through these doors tells me something.

88
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:32,008
我是你能负担得起的最好的律师
It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford.

89
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,011
如果我们继续这件事的话
If we go forward with this,

90
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,090
那么就会很耗钱...很多很多钱
it's gonna take money a... lot of it.

91
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,088
即使是在我这样的价位上
Even at my rates.

92
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:43,099
现在我们处在弱势  所以我得问你
This is David and Goliath,so I gotta ask you,

93
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:47,073
你真得想要这么做么?
are you sure you wanna do this?

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:52,022
他们不能带走我的儿子
They're not taking my son away.

95
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,025
Walt

96
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:57,066
Walt

97
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,020
Walt

98
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,036
Mike  你省点力吧
Mike! You should save your energy.

99
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,071
他们带走了我的儿子
They took my son!

100
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:04,054
是的  我看见了...上了一艘船
Yeah, I saw. Onto a boat,

101
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:06,015
这就意味着任你怎么叫他也听不到
which means he's not in shouting distance!

102
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,071
-你不会知道的  -我能感知到
-You don't know that!  -I got a good sense.

103
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,057
并且即使他听见了  你又能怎么办呢?
Even if he was,there's nothing you can do.

104
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,009
听着  如果他能听见我叫
If he can hear me,

105
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,066
他就知道我还活着
he knows I'm alive,

106
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,069
而且我一定会去找他
that I'm coming for him,

107
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,012
并且把他救回来
that I'm going to get him back!

108
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:20,050
现在我唯一的希望就是他能听见我喊他
Right now, all I got is that maybe my son can hear me...

109
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,038
这和你有关系么?
Does that make any sense to you?

110
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,075
Walt

111
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:37,007
Walt

112
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,059
Kate

113
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,021
Kate

114
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,013
John

115
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:21,038
放松  没事  没事的
Easy, easy, easy.

116
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:25,040
你后面
Behind you.

117
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:31,029
你是他么?
Are you him?

118
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:36,006
你是他么?
Are you him?

119
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,005
Jin

120
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,064
Jin

121
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:45,068
Jin

122
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:49,070
我们省点力吧
I thought we had to save our energy.

123
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,039
噢  呃...Jin还在水中
Yeah, well,Jin's still out there in the water,

124
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,064
如果不影响你  我打算再叫一会儿
so if it's OK by you I'm gonna keep shoutin' awhile.

125
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,029
Jin

126
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,038
心虚了么?
Feeling guilty?

127
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:04,080
什么?
What?

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,005
是你叫我发射闪光弹的
You made me fire that flare.

129
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,077
是我叫你发射...
I made you fire...

130
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,084
什么  这是我的错么?
What, this is my fault?

131
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,078
他们带走了我的儿子
They took my son.

132
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,058
他们找到了我们  带走了Walt
They found us, took Walt,

133
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,076
全都是因为你叫我发射了闪光弹
because you made me fire the flare.

134
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,053
至少Walt还在一艘船上
Well, at least Walt is on a boat.

135
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,087
可能还裹着毯子喝着可可
Probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa

136
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:26,051
-而我们只是在...  -离开我的筏子
-while we're on...  -Get off my raft.

137
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,066
-什么?  -离...
-What?  -Get...

138
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:34,031
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

139
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:01,001
你还紧握着你最好的伙伴啊
I see you managed to hold on to your best friend, there.

140
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,085
它不会有用了
Thing ain't gonna work anyway.

141
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,079
-它会有用的  -你落过水
-It'll work.  -You were underwater.

142
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,074
你对枪有多了解  笨蛋?
What do you know about guns anyway,Hoss?

143
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:11,093
它还能用
It'll work.

144
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,033
如果子弹是干的  那火药也是干的
If the bullets are dry,the powder's dry.

145
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:20,001
如果火药是...
If the powder's...

146
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:26,054
哦天...那到底是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

147
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:30,069
是鲨鱼
It's a shark.

148
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:34,033
只是一只鲨鱼
It's only a shark.

149
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,080
"只是一只鲨鱼"?
"It's only a shark"?

150
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,002
是为了让我好过点么?
That's supposed to make me feel better?

151
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:40,064
呃  我想我知道为什么鲨鱼游到这儿来了
Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around.

152
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,028
你的肩膀
Your shoulder.

153
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:46,018
哦  好  那我马上去止血
Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then.

154
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:49,030
你突然好像什么都忘了
You suddenly forget what happened?

155
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,055
-我为什么会被击伤?  -什么?
-Why I got shot?  -What?

156
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:54,047
我是说  你连一点感激都没有么?
How about a little gratitude here?

157
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,051
我是说  你说句谢谢行不?
I mean, how about "Thank you"?

158
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,074
谢谢?  为了什么?
Thank you? For what?

159
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:04,069
是为了你想救自己?

165
00:12:57,064 --> 00:13:00,069
你上次看到你儿子的确切时间是什么时候?
When was the last time you actually saw your son?

166
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,007
大概一年前吧

00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:05,004
实际上是14个月

172
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,011
你说什么?
Excuse me?

173
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,075
因为现在她要去罗马但你又要申请禁令
Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction,

174
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,096
看起来和以前的有点矛盾
it just seems a little inconsistent.

175
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:25,014
矛盾...不
Incon... No.

176
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,000

你说过我无能为力的

然后你就什么也没做  是么?  
And you didn't, did you?

181
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
他不会回答这个问题的
He's not gonna answer that.

182
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,001
那是因为他回答不出
Because there is no answer.

183
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:41,092
你最近是不是刚遭遇了车祸?
You were in an accident recently?

00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,052
我并没有向你要过什么
I didn't ask you for anything.

190
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:57,023
这是不是能说明Dawson先生承认 
Could the record reflect Mr Dawson acknowledged

191
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,023
Lloyd小姐帮他付了这些钱?
Miss Lloyd paid his bills?

192

Susan  告诉他们我并没有向你要过什么

不知道
No.

201
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:32,078
对于一个死命要保留做父亲权力的人来说
Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly,

202
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,051
你是不是太不了解你的孩子了  Dawson先生
you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr Dawson.

203
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,052
我是他的父亲

206
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:01,083
你疯了么?
Are you crazy?

207
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,017
你想徒手取出子弹么?
You gonna take the bullet out with your bare hands?

Then go to hell.

你一个人是做不到的

228
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,012
把刀放下
Get rid of the knife.

229
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:22,042
你不是他
You're not him!

230
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,048
我们不是来伤害你的
We didn't come here to hurt you.

231
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,093

00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:30,073
绑我是毫无意义的  我不是危险人物
It's pointless to tie me up,I'm not dangerous.

What does that make you, then, brother?

246
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:46,013
我是一个纸板生产公司的区域经理
I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer.

247
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:50,013
主要是生产盒子

248
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:54,023
好吧  那么  盒子先生  把她绑起来
All right then, Box Man. Tie her up.

那你说的那些
What about all that stuff you said

258

等着看日出的话是怎么回事?
about waiting until morning and watching the sun rise?

259
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,082
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

260
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:44,011
你想是怎么回事?
What do you suppose all that's about?

261
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:48,024
我猜Jack要做一些豪情壮举了
I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic.

262
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,083
怎么了?
What?

263
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,027
你总是以故意说笑来掩饰
You always try to be funny

264
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:54,027
当你不想回答一个问题的时候
when you don't want to answer a question.

265
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:58,062
"故意"说笑?
"Try" to be funny?

266
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:04,052
这是什么?
What's this?

267
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:09,046
噢  在丛林里找到的
I found it in the jungle.

268
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,013
-你找到的?     -是的
-You found it?    -Yeah.

269
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,019
当心  拿着那东西要小心点
Be careful...Be careful with it.

270
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:17,052
来来  抱着Aaron
Here, hey, take Aaron.

271
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,089
来吧  接住你了
Come here. There you go.

你得小心点  你知道  这是圣母玛利亚
You gotta be careful with it, you know,it's the Virgin Mary.

273
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,050
她是很神圣的
She's holy.

274
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,016
倒没发现你居然是这么虔诚的信徒
I didn't realise you were so religious.

275
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,088
我不是  这只是...你知道
I'm not. It's just, you know,

276
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:34,044
它迟早会派上用场的
it might come in handy.

277
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:39,013
带在身上是不错的东西
Be a nice thing to have around.

278
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:50,073
那不是因为闪光弹
It wasn't the flare.

279
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:57,030
我说了  那不是因为闪光弹
I said it wasn't the flare.

280
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,077
那些人这么做...
Those people that did this...

281
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:06,096
起先我以为他们是渔民或是海盗什么的
At first I thought they were fishermen or pirates or something.

282
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:09,085
然后我仔细看了他们的船
Then I got a good look at their boat.

283
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:13,088
你了解船么  Mike?
You know anything about boats, Mike?

284
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,074
那种船不是用来在大洋上开的
Boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean.

285
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,069
一点小风小浪就能让船进水
Water's coming over the side the first little squall.

286
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:23,065
航程可能也就一百多里吧

287
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:28,065
不  像那样的船应该是在一个很近的码头驶出的
Nope. A boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close.

288
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:31,096
比如说那个岛
Like the island.

289
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:36,047
法国女人说"其他人"是冲着孩子来的
French chick said the Others were coming for the kid.

290
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:40,000
我认为他们来了  Mike

291
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,067
-什么?    -他是他们想要的人
-What?    -He's the one they wanted,

292
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,079
我肩膀为什么会中弹
why I got a bullet in my shoulder.

293
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,038
那些人炸飞了我们就是因为他们想要你的孩子
Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.

294
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,044
-你是说这都是我的错?    -是的  这就是我要说的
-You saying this is my fault?    -Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'.

295
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,037
-他们是因为你才带走我的孩子的    -我们
-They took him because of you.   -We

296
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,049
他们当时已经驶远了
They were sailing away!

297
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,057
他们找到我们是因为他们在找我们  在找Walt
They found us because they were looking for us! For Walt!

298
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:59,091
你不许再叫他的名字  不许
Don't ever say his name again, ever!

299
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:04,077
你能怎么样  用水泼我?
What you gonna do? Splash me?

300
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:50,088
-听着  我知道...   -闭嘴
-Look. I know...    -Shut up!

301
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:53,024
别说了
Don't even...

302
00:22:53,024 --> 00:23:01,087
你根本不知道怎么关心别人
You have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.

303
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:19,042
你的律师呢?
Where are your lawyers?

304
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:23,022
我跟他们说了  我想和你单独谈谈
I told them I wanted to talk.Just you and me.

305
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:25,018
但如果你想让你的律师来  我能理解
But if you want yours, I understand.

306
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:30,017
不  不用了
No. It's OK.

307
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:39,044
我想你会赢
I think you're gonna win.

308
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:42,087
-什么?  -在法庭上
-Excuse me?  -In court.

309
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:47,011
我想你会有权阻止我带着Walt离开的
I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt.

310

但是我只是...想问你为什么

311
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:55,055
-什么为什么?  -你为什么这么做?

312
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:58,053
-他是我的儿子  -从什么时候开始的  Michael?
-He's my son.  -Since when, Michael?

313
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,099
听着  我知道你不关心我如何好过
Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me,

314
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,003
但是在罗马  我在公司可以是一个资深合伙人
but in Rome I'll be a senior partner at the firm.

315
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:06,065
我可以给Walt他需要的一切

你现在行动仍然受限Michael  你无法工作
You're still on disability, Michael.You can't work.

317
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,062
你的公寓快被收回了
You're about to be evicted.

318
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,022
你的律师是在调查我么?

319
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,033
恩  当然是的
Of course I did.

320
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,072
就像你的律师也在调查我一样
Just like you had your lawyers check up on me.

321
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:22,076
-大家都不是赢家  -那么住口
-Nobody's winning.  -Then stop.

322
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:29,014
Michael  你需要做的第一件事是照顾好你自己
Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself.

323
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:30,098
你得健康起来
You need to get healthy,

324
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,081
你得有足够的经济基础
you need to get back on your feet financially

325
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:36,079
那样你才能继续回去追求你的艺术

326
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,066
作为一个艺术家你有罕见的天份  Michael
You have rare talent as an artist,Michael.

327
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:43,007
但是你怎么才能做到这些事呢
But how are you going to do that,any of that,

328
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:47,057
这样能成为Walt生命中的一部分么?
and still be a part of Walt's life?

329
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:50,057
我会通过努力做到的
I'll do it by doing it.

330
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,098
抚养Walt也是我的责任
Walt is my responsibility too.

331
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:58,005
那么就放他走
Then let him go.

332
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,048
因为这不是关于我和你的事
Because it's not about you or me.

333
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:05,047
这是他的事
It's about him.

334
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:18,063
我不想和你打官司  Michael
I don't want to go to court, Michael.

335
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:22,094
那么就拜托你...
So please, just...

336
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:27,022
放他走吧
let him go.

337
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,076
飞行员说我们失去了无线电联络
The pilot said we had lost radio contact,

338
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:37,028
但是在那之前  我们已经偏离了航线近千里了
but by then we were already a thousand miles off course.

339
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:40,006
并且搜救队几周前就应该放弃搜索了
Any search teams would've given up weeks ago.

340
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:43,012
那么你正从悉尼飞往洛杉矶?
So you were travelling from Sydney to Los Angeles?

341
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,000
是的

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,057
那么另外那些人还在外面?
So the world is still out there?

343
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:51,046
就我所知  是的
Yeah, as far as I know.

344

348
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,044
你得明白  现在真的不需要这把枪了
You should know the gun is really unnecessary.

349
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,013
噢  是么?
Oh yeah?

350
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:17,075
那么我应该把它交给你了  是么?
So I should just hand it over to you then, should I?

351
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,058
你们那儿有多少人?
How many of you are there?

00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:27,065
筏子?
A raft?

354
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,054
那个模拟日光  是因为你从来不离开么?
That simulated sunlight,is that because you never leave?

355
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:34,065
还有其他的出口么?
Is there another way out?

生病?
Sick?

生病  就是病了死了
Sick. As in ill. As in dead.

359
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:44,009
这就是为什么舱门里写着"检疫隔离"的原因么?
Is that why it says "Quarantine"on the hatch?

360
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,076
-回答我     -没人生病  没有人

筏子的一部分  浮着的竹筒
