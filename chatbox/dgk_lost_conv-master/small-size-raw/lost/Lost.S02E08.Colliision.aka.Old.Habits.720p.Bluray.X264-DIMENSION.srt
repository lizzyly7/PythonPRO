比比我们俩谁更精确?

130
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,062
你在开玩笑  是么?
You're kidding, right?

131
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:47,030
三个洞  不设标准杆  谁赢谁才有权说大话
Three holes,no handicap.We play for bragging rights.

132
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,096
我们还等什么?
What are we waiting for?

133
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:01,014
Ana  我们快去他们的营地吧  那只是一场意外

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,088
-我不会...  -放开我
-I'm not gonna...  -Untie me!

139
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:31,071
Ana!

140
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,076

What are you doing?

141
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,014
我把他带回他的营地
I'm taking him back to his camp.

142

别走  求你了
Don't leave. Please.

143
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,076
如果你和他互换  他是不会救你的
If that were you,he'd let you die.

144
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:49,023
我不是为了他才这么做的
I'm not doing it for him.

145
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,075
我是为了我自己
I'm doing it for me.

那个心理医生给了你什么好药?
So that shrink give you any good drugs?

147
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,099
不是那种心理医生
Not that kind of shrink.

148
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:16,072
-你想我么?  -伙计  当然

-让我来吧  -不不  我来

你得听我说  好么?
You need to listen to me, okay?

308
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,008
只有你吞下了这颗药丸你才能好

315
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,083
我从没在医学院学过耳语治疗
Never learned the whole whisper-in-the-earthing in med school.

316
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:51,093
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

317

318
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:58,053
我不想再这么呆下去了
I don't want to be a part of this.

319
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:02,023
我了解你为我们做的一切
I know everything you've done for us.

320
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:09,028
并且如果不是你我根本不可能活下来 但是我要走了

00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:14,008
你呢?
What about you?

322
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:18,027
我只是认为你的性格不太好
I just don't think you're the best judge of character.

323
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:23,052
你把Nathan扔进坑里这件事我倒是很赞同的
I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.

324
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:28,005

333
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:55,056
没事的  Jin很好
It's all right. Jin is okay.

334
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,060
发生了什么事?  他在哪儿?
What happened? Where is he?

335
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,040

-Jack  这不是他的错... -Shannon死了  我不...
-Jack, it's not his fault...  -Shannon's dead! I'm not...

340
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,054
你得马上把我带回那儿去
You're gonna take me back out there right now.

341
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:33,027
问题不在他身上  他把Sawyer带回来了
This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back.

342
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:38,056
已经半死了  肩上还有个枪眼  John
Half-dead, with a bullet hole through his shoulder, John!

伊拉克
I am from Iraq.

376

你有孩子么?
You have any kids?

377
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:19,040
你为什么这么问?
Why are you asking me if I have children?

378
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,008
我很好奇
I'm curious.

379
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:24,060

你会杀了我么?
Are you going to kill me?

382
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:33,070
你现在就在想这个问题  是么?
That's what you're thinking about, isn't it?

383
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,031
我需要么?
Should I?

384
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:44,033
大约40天前  在这个岛上
Almost 40 days ago, on this very island,

385
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:49,051
我把一个男人绑在树上拷问他
I tied a man to a tree,and I tortured him.

386
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:54,050
我折磨他就像我折磨的许多人一样...
I tortured him, as I've tortured many men...

387
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:00,010
晚上那些人的声音还回响在我耳畔
men whose voices I still hear at night.

388
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:05,023
你该杀我么?
Should you kill me?

389
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,097
也许你该这么做
Maybe you should.

390
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:14,021
也许你正打算这么做
Maybe you were meant to.

391
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,083
我是个警察
I'm a cop.

392
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:37,024
我曾是个警察
Well... I was a cop.

393
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:43,001
一个晚上  我和我的搭档  去处理一起入室行窃案件
One night, my partner and I responded to a burglary call.

394
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,014
我们是第一个到达那儿的
We were the first ones there.

395
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:51,056
我在前门守着  他去后面察看
I covered the front,and he went around the back.

396
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,078
过了一会儿
I was there a minute.

397
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:59,037
那个孩子从前门出来了
Then this kid comes right through the front door.

398
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:02,010
我叫他把手举起来
I tell him to put his hands up.

399
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,045
但他说我弄错了
And he says I'm making a mistake,

400
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,061
他还是个学生
that he's a student.

401
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:13,081
而且他想给我看他的身份证
And he wants to show me his I.D.

402
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:17,039
我相信了
I believed him.

403
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,084
我就...
I just...

404
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:26,074
我就让他过来了
I let him reach.

405
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:30,036
然后就是一声枪响
All I remember was a pop.

406
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:35,054
我倒地的时候我以为我已经死了
By the time I hit the ground, I thought I was dead.

407
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:43,018
我觉得我死了
I feel dead.

408
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:52,002
那个人后来怎样了...那个向你开枪的人?
What happened to him...the man who shot you?

409
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:38,035
Jason.

410
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:50,035
我认识你?
I know you?

411
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,020
我那时怀孕了
I was pregnant.

412
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:14,066
他后来怎样了?
What happened to him?

413
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:27,083
不知道  他们没抓住他
Nothing. They never found him.

414
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,081
来吧
Go ahead.

415
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:02,097
捡起来
Pick it up.

416
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:06,096
这是我应得的报应
I deserve it.

417
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:18,056
杀了你又有什么好处...
What good would it be to kill you...

418
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:23,079
如果我们已经都死了呢?
if we're both already dead?

419
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:28,073
能听见我说话么?
Can you hear me?

420
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:34,051
你会好起来的
You're gonna be okay.

421
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:40,030
你会没事的
You're gonna be all right.

422
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:43,079
你回家了
You're home.
