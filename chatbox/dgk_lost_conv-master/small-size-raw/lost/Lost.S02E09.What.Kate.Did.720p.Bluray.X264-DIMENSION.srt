对不起  伙计  我知道这很不好受
Sorry, man. I know this hurts.

4
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,036
你是徒手把子弹取出来的
you pulled the bullet out with your bare hands.

5
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:17,000
有时间你一定要再给我演示一下

00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:28,056
她连着24小时一直在照看你
She's been watching over you for the past 24 hours straight.

9
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:29,030
唯一能让她休息的办法
The only way I could get rid of her

10
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,061
就是让她出去给你弄点吃的
was to send her out to get some food for you.

11
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:34,082
我爱她
I love her.

12
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,065

13
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,058

好了  我扶你到床上去
All right, let's get you to the bed.

17
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:33,074
当心脚下  当心点
Watch your step, watch your step!

18
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,082
什么味道这么难闻
What the hell is that smell?

19
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,004
-是你呼出来的  -是的
-Probably your breath.  -Yeah, right.

20

你真漂亮
You're beautiful.

我刚才称赞你了
I just gave you a compliment.

23

是的  我听见了
Yeah, I heard you.

24
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:11,084
你怎么不先把我裤子脱下来
Aren't you gonna take my pants off first?

25
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,048
你真漂亮
You are beautiful.

26
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,041
晚安
Good night.

27
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,010
咖啡  馅饼  还是两个都要
Coffee, pie? Both?

28
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,072
来杯啤酒怎么样
How about a beer?

29
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:47,004
让我看看身份证
I'd like to see some I.D.

30
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,043
我24岁了  妈妈
I'm 24, ma.

31
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,067
你又想不戴安全帽疯骑摩托
You want to ride around on that death trap of yours without a helmet.

32
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:56,062
我是不会让你喝醉的
I'm not going to help your cause by getting you drunk.

33
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:03,099
你手腕怎么了
How's that wrist?

34
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,099
什么  这个
What, this?

35
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,047
你也知道 
You know,

36
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:09,081
厨房的那个架子有的时候会突出来
that shelf in the kitchen sticks out sometimes.

37
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,094
虽然我会记得它在那儿  但我还是撞了上去
You'd think I'd remember it was there, but I banged it...

38
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:15,000
别骗我了
Don't.

39
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:24,037
别管我的事  Katherine
I made my bed, Katherine.

40
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:27,001
你的房子已经不在了  妈妈
Well, your bed's gone, ma.

41
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:30,013

What?

42
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,032
-这是什么  -这栋房子的保险
-What is this?  -An insurance policy for the house.

00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:45,015
-什么  我从来没有...  -我以你的名义取出来的
-What? I never...  -I took it out in your name.

44
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:51,087
你做了什么
What did you do?

45
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,087
Wayne 知道这事吗
Does Wayne know about this?

46
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,065
记住你一直在这里
Just remember that you were here

47
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:00,093
而且没有看到过我  好么
and you didn't see me, okay?

48
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:04,026
Katherine  你到底做了什么
Katherine, what did you do?

49
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:08,012
我是为你好  妈妈
I took care of you, ma.

50
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,002
我得走了
I gotta go.

51
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:14,006
你这一阵子不会再见到我了
You're not gonna see me for awhile.

52
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:25,021
Katherine

53
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:27,071
你做了什么
What did you do?

54
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:31,034
Katherine

55
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,044
你还好吗
Are you okay?

56
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,032
很好
Yeah.

57
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:45,015
我想我只是...
I think I'm just...

58
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:48,073
只是有点累了
I think I'm tired.

59
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:53,029
-他怎么样了  -还在发烧
-How is he?  -Fever's still up there.

60
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:55,070
也不知道抗生素有没有起作用
Can't tell if the antibiotics are working.

61
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,038
让他吃点东西会有好处
It'll help to get some food in him.

62
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:01,036
你应该去海滩上...
You should get down to the beach for...

63
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:04,028
参加Shannon的葬礼
for Shannon.

64
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,068
我觉得
I was actually thinking that

65
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:08,048
我留下来照顾Sawyer会更好
I should stay and watch Sawyer.

66
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:11,003
我来就行了
I'll stay with him.

67
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,093
你应该去那儿
You should be there.

68
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,048
不要让他缺水
Keep him hydrated.

69
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,023
把水果捣碎  
Maybe mash upsome of that fruit,

70
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,050
看看能不能给他吃一点
see if you can get him to eat it.

71
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,028
每个人都会去海滩
And everybody will beat the beach,

72
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,007
所以别忘了那个按钮
so don't forget the button.

73
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,073
我知道了
I got it.

74
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:32,059
我马上回来
Be back in a couple of hours.

75
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:38,009
你确定你能行吗
You sure you're okay?

76
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:42,016
对  我可以
Yeah, I'm great.

77
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:03,094
我要去参加葬礼
I'm going to go to the funeral.

78
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:11,075
我想我不会去
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

79
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:25,034
我想大部分人会知道那是一个意外
I think most of them realize it was an accident.

80
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:10,036
Shannon和我互不相识
Shannon and I were strangers.

81
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:14,072
我们永远都不会相遇如果...
We never would have met if...

82
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,044
我们甚至都不会和对方说话如果...
we wouldn't even have spoken if...

83
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,055
但是我们确实相遇了  也说话了
but we did meet, and we did speak.

84
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,084
至少...
At least...

85
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:51,035
我爱她
I loved her.

86
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:32,000
愿她安息
May she rest in peace.

87
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,046
你饿吗
You hungry?

88
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:02,097
我正准备给你吃点水果
I'm just gonna mash you up some fruit here.

89
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,040
当你醒来的时候
When you wake up,

90
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,057
看见我在像喂婴儿一样喂你 
you're going to get a kick out of me

91
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:09,044
你肯定会踹我
feeding you like a baby.

92
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:16,075
我看见了一匹马
I saw a horse.

93
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,050
是的
Yeah.

94
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,001
你缺乏睡眠就会这样
That's what happens when you don't sleep.

95
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,027
Sawyer

96
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:39,013
-你醒了吗  -毫无价值的...
-You awake?  -Good for nothing...

97
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,078
你杀了我
You killed me.

98
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,091
你为什么要杀我
Why did you kill me?!

99
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:57,026
是警报声
It's the alarm.

100
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,020
Kate

101
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,004
Kate

102
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,049
Sawyer

103
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,087
16 2...
16 2...

104
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:37,094
-发生了什么  -我不知道
-What happened?  -I don't know.

105
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:41,045
-但是你说过...  -我不知道 John
-But you said...  -I don't know, John!

106
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:44,071
那么  Kate在哪
Well, where's Kate?

107
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,062
Kate

108
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:51,009
你没去参加葬礼
Hey,you missed the funeral.

109
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,012
对  我在照顾Sawyer
Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.

110
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:55,091
对
Oh, right.

111
00:13:55,091 --> 00:14:00,035
新来的那些人  他们有几个也参加了
A  few of them came,the new people.

112
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:02,037
那个杀了Shannon的女人没去  
Not her, the one who killed Shannon.

113
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,023
不然会很尴尬
That would have been awkward.

114
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,081
他们好像过得很不开心
They seem to have had a rough time of it.

115
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:11,064
就像在演苍蝇王这部电影一样
Looks like they went bloody "lord of the flies" out there.

116
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:17,028
我说的你一句都没听进去
You haven't listened to a word I've said.

117
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:19,083
你觉得这有马吗
Do you think there are horses here?

118
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,017
什么
What?

119
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:25,024
我想我在丛林里看见了一匹马
I think I saw a horse in the jungle.

142
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,097
是你妈妈把你供出来的  Kate
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

She was acting kind of balmy,

146
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,035
问我岛上有没有马
asking me about horses on the island.

00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:07,042
它们会直接掉下来
they'll come from the ceiling.

161
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,055
下边的那个家伙
That guy down here

162
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:10,066
-Desmond  -对了  Desmond
-Desmond?-Yeah, Desmond.

163
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,043
他没告诉你它们是干什么用的
He didn't tell you about these, what they're for?

164
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:17,010
没有  他没说
No, no, he didn't,

165
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,071
但是他留下了一段影片
but he did leave a movie.

166
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,097
影片
A movie?

167
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:23,015
没错
Yeah.

168
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:25,078
你想看吗
You want to see it?

169
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,010
我也想看
I would like to see it, too.

170
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:35,032
如果你不介意的话
If you don't mind.

171
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,013
当然可以
Why not?

172
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,071
人越多越好
The more, the merrier.

173
00:17:54,094 --> 00:18:00,092
Kate  你到底在这干吗
Kate, what the hell are you doing out here?

174
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:04,016
舱子里发生了什么  Kate  你为什么离开了
What happened in the hatch, Kate? Why'd you leave?

175
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,017
我回去的时候发现Sawyer就这么躺在地上
I come back. I find Sawyer just lying on the ground.

176
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,093
-你就这么走了  -他还好吗
-You just took off.  -Is he okay?

177
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:12,003
对  Kate  他没事
Yes, Kate, he's fine.

178
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:16,001
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

179
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,031
真的是你
Are you?

180
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:23,008
对  我很抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry.

181
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,025
我很抱歉我并不像你那样完美
I'm sorry that I am not as perfect as you!

182
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:30,019
我很抱歉我没有那么出色
I'm sorry that I'm not as good!

183
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,068
-你到底怎么了  -算了
-What's going on with you?  -Just forget it.

184
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,067
-不  别走  不要  -让我走
-No, don't walk away from me, no.  -Let me go!

185
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,096
Kate  Kate  Kate  Kate

186
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:37,044
不  我...
Don't! I...

187
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:40,059
没事的  没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

188
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,028
Kate

189
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:46,013
这个地方...这个地方太奇怪了
This place...this place is crazy.

190
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:49,005
我受不了了  我都要疯了
I can't. It's driving me nuts.

191
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:51,078
我知道  没事了
I know. It's okay.It's all right.

192
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:53,073
没事了
It's all right.

193
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,035
没事了
It's all right.

194
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:58,070
好么
All right?

195
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,081
Kate

196
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:49,009
从警报响起那一刻起
From the moment the alarm sounds,

197
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,086
你有四分钟时间向那台电脑
you will have four minutes to enter the code

198
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:54,039
输入那串数字
into the microcomputer processor.

199
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,028
来启动程序
Induction into the program.

200
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,022
当警报响起
When the alarm sounds,

201
00:19:58,022 --> 00:20:00,037
你或你的搭档必须输入数字
either you or your partner must input the code.

202
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,017
强烈推荐给你
It is highly recommended that

203
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,012
你和你的搭档最好轮班

204
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,018
这样  你们就可以时刻保持警觉
In this manner, you will both stay as fresh and alert

205
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:12,047
最重要的就是当警报响起时

206

密码要准确并及时的输入电脑

207
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:20,061
不要尝试使用电脑做任何事...
Do not attempt to use the computer for anything...

208
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,097
当你的替班到了之后
Until your replacements arrive,

209
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:27,006
此项目的成败将掌握在你的手里
the future of the project is in your hands.

210
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:28,092
我代表Degroots
On behalf of the Degroots,

211
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:32,080
Alvar Hanso和达摩启动计划中的所有同僚

祝你们好运

214
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:45,015
好了
All right.

215
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,042
那么每两个小时按一次按钮
So you've been pushing that button every two hours

216
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,045
那你自从下到这里后  
since you got down here.

217
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,065
没错
That's right.

218
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:53,097
你是怎么做到的
How's that even work?

219
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,009
我安排了两人轮班  
I've set up 2-person shifts,

220
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,060
每人六个小时  每个人都会轮到
6 hours. Everyone's on the roster.

221
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,016
他们不想知道为什么这么做吗
Don't they want to know why?

222
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,077
我想这个电影已经说得很清楚了
I think the film is pretty self-explanatory.

223
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:04,094
真的么
Really?

224
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,044
我只听到一些
All I heard was

225
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,037
关于电磁石和突发事件什么的
something about electromagnets and an incident.

226
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,042
少掉的那些部分呢
What about all the missing pieces?

227
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,072
你是说那些连接的部分
you mean the splices?

228
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,010
只是一帧一帧的画面 
Yeah, just a frame here and there,

229
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,048
我觉得没什么重要的
I think, nothing important.

230
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,029
你觉得呢
What do you think?

231
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:22,051
对于那部电影  你怎么看
About the film, what do you think?

232
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:09,087
我很抱歉错过了她的葬礼
I'm sorry I missed it,her funeral.

233
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:12,071
我... 我得照顾Sawyer  所以...
I... I had to be with Sawyer, so...

234
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,039
你现在怎么没跟他在一起
Why aren't you with him now?

235
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:25,000
因为我快要疯了
'Cause I'm going crazy.

236
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:35,090
你相不相信鬼  Sayid
Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?

237
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:44,026
就在Shannon被枪击之前我在丛林里看见了Walt
I saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot.

238
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:56,093
那有让我发疯么
Does that make me crazy?

239
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,029
去审讯室要开很长时间
It's a long drive back to the arraignment.

240
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,027
你还好吧
You comfy?

241
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:33,016
为什么是现在
Why now?

242
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,023
什么
What?

243
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,068
像你这样的农场乖女孩
Nice corn-fed farm girl like yourself,

244
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:40,058
没有暴力史  优等生 
no history of violence,straight A's,

245
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:44,037
没有前科  只有几张超速罚单
no record,a couple of speeding tickets.

246
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:49,008
我只是好奇  为什么你现在要杀了他
I just gotta wonder,why'd you kill him now?

247
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,075
好了  还是别和我说了
Oh, right, yeah, don't tell me.

248
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:54,011
你不会想控告你自己的
You wouldn't want to incriminate yourself,

249
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:57,021
不然你不会精心策划了这一切
not after you were so smart planning it.

250
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:58,086
爱荷华州的陪审团肯定不会  
That jury back in Iowa sure ain't gonna

251
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:01,051
在是否是预谋杀人上迟疑的
get hung upon premeditation.

252
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:04,001
放煤气是么
And a gas leak?

253
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:08,017
拜托  手法太幼稚了
Come on, it's amateur hour from top to bottom.

254
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:10,060
看上去你好像都已经明白了
It sounds like you've got it all figured out.

255
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,004
我倒是把你看透了
I do have you all figured out.

256
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:14,003
对于我你什么都不知道
You don't know anything about me.

257
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:16,016
你妈是离了婚的贫穷白种女人
White-trash mom divorces dad,

258
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:18,043
和一个酒鬼拍拖
starts up  with some guy who's a drinker,

259
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:20,056
也许他对她很粗暴
maybe he knocks her around a little bit,

260
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:23,052
之所以她嫁给他是因为  你知道的
and so she marries him because, you know,

261
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:25,038
发生了一些事
that's what happens.

262
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,035
然后这个酒鬼  Wayne
And then this drunk, this Wayne,

263
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,080
他搬进了你家
he moves into your house,

264
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,045
你就得每晚整理房间
and you get to lay there every night

265
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:32,065
听着他在那里干你妈
and listen to him doing your mom right there

266
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,079
在你爸的老卧室里
in your daddy's old bedroom.

267
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,084
这也许还不算很坏
And even that wouldn't be so bad

268
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:38,036
如果他没有一直打你妈妈 
if he didn't beat her up all the time.

269
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:41,078
但是她爱他
But she loves him,

270
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:45,064
她为他辩护
she defends him.

271
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,098
如果这样还不能让一个人想要杀人
If that don't make a person want to kill somebody,

272
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:52,095
我就不知道什么能了
I don't know what does.

273
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:55,026
但问题是  现在
But the question is, now?

274
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,003
为什么是现在
Why now?

275
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:59,012
为什么这么多年以后
Why after all these years

276
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:04,030
你才决定要把可怜的Wayne干掉
did you just decide to blow poor Wayne up?

277
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:11,088
他晚上去敲你的门了
He come knocking on your door late at night?

278
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:16,015
他从来没碰过我
He never touched me.

279
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:21,053
小心
Look out!

280
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:46,063
滚...
Get...

281
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:50,012
滚下去
Get off!

282
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:24,070
你现在为什么不输数字呢
Why can't you just put the numbers in now?

283
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,084
不  现在输没用
No, it doesn't work that way.

284
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,015
警报在还剩四分钟时响起
The alarm goes off in four minutes.

285
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:32,078
到那时你才能输入
You can't type anything till then.

286
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:40,052
不介意我看看这些硬件吧
You mind if I check out some of this hardware?

287
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:43,083
当然
Sure.

288
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:47,076
别弄坏就好了
Just don't break it.

289
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:59,027
你好
Hello again.

290
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:02,013
你好
Hello.

291
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:08,000
我想我有样东西你该看看
I have something I think you should see.

292
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,009
如果你不介意的话
If you don't mind,

293
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,013
我将从头说起
I will begin at the beginning.

294
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,088
在耶稣之前很久的时候
Long before Christ,

295
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:26,087
犹太国国王是一个叫Josian的人
the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.

296
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:32,031
伙计  你说从头说起这头还真是久远
Boy, when you say "beginning,"you mean beginning.

297
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:34,011
那时候
At that time,

298
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:38,060
人们供奉神灵的神庙被毁了
the temple where the people worshipped was in ruin,

299
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,060
所以他们就崇拜偶像
and  so the people worshipped idols,

300
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,013
假的神灵
false gods,

301
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,077
所以国家一片混乱
and so the kingdom was in disarray.

302
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:51,011
因为Josian是个好国王
Josiah, since he was a good king,

303
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,089
他派他的大臣去藏宝藏的地方
sent his secretary to the treasury

304
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,056
说道
and said,

305
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:58,049
"我们必须重建神庙
"we must rebuild the temple.

306
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,022
"把所有的金子发给工人
Give all of the gold to the

307
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:03,023
"这样就能行了"
workers so that this will be done."

308
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:06,063
但是当大臣回来时
But when the secretary returned,

309
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:10,006
他并没有带着金子
he had no gold.

310
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:14,026
当Josian问为什么的时候
And when Josiah asked why this was,

311
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:18,075
大臣回答说...
the secretary replied...

312
00:28:21,054 --> 00:28:25,082
"我们找到一本书"
"we found a book."

313
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:29,001
你听过这个故事吗
Do you know this story?

314
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,088
没有  恐怕没有
No, afraid I don't.

315
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:35,040
大臣找到的
What the secretary had found

316
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,092
是一本很老的书
was an ancient book,

317
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:42,085
律法书
the book of law.

318
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:47,014
你也许在圣经的旧约中听说过
You may know it as the Old Testament.

319
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:51,049
因为那本律法书
And it was with that ancient book,

320
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,044
而不是靠金子
not with the gold,

321
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:58,022
Josian还是建起了神殿
that Josiah rebuilt the temple.

322
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:04,087
在岛的另一边
On the other side of the island,

323
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:10,053
我们找到了一个和这里类似的地方
we found a place much like this.

324
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:13,093
在那个地方
And in this place,

325
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:18,048
我们找到了一本书
we found a book.

326
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,028
我相信那里面的东西 
I believe what's inside there

327
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:35,026
对你有很大的价值
will be of great value to you.

328
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:38,095
Rose的丈夫是白人啊
So Rose's husband's white.

329
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:41,030
没看见过他过来吗
Didn't see that one coming.

330
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,010
你需要什么东西吗  Hurley
Is there something you need, Hurley?

331
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,098
只是随便走走
Just taking a walk,

332
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:49,033
来打个招呼
thought I'd say "hey."

333
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,008
谁在照看Sawyer
Who's taking care of Sawyer?

334
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:54,079
Sun
Sun is.

335
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,085
那么你  有点生他的气
So you're, like, mad at him?

336
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:02,088
我为什么会生Sawyer的气
Why would I be mad at Sawyer?

337
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:05,038
也许因为他老是生病
Maybe 'cause he's the one always comes down here

338
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,089
接着是Chops Wood  现在连你也快了
and chops wood and now you are.

339
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,052
就像瘟疫一样
It's, like, transference.

340
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:13,091
你现在是心理医生吗
What are you? A shrink now?

341
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:18,007
在精神病院别人就是这么叫我的
Well, that's what they call it in the mental hospital.

342
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:21,084
我没有生任何人的气
I'm not mad at anyone.

343
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,034
Jack在哪儿
Where's Jack?

344
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:35,054
我不知道
I don't know.

345
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:39,001
他没回来过
He didn't come back.

346
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:42,032
他有说过什么吗
Has he said anything?

347
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:45,005
Sawyer?

348
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:49,083
没有  他一直睡着
No, he's still sleeping.

349
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:55,001
你能照看他吗
Can you watch him?

350
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:58,059
-如果你有事那我可以...  -不不  我来吧
-I can stay if you...  -No. Yeah, I can.

351
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:01,072
谢谢
Thanks.

352
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:29,069
是的  我确定就是那张表
Yes, I'm sure that's the exact form you've got.

353
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:34,096
我会发一张给你  好吧
I'll send one over to you, right.

354
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:40,000
稍后打给你
I'll call you back later.

355
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:49,019
爸爸
Dad.

356
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:53,000
亲爱的  现在警察们
Kate, the police and the U.S.Marshals

357
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,049
都在通缉你
are looking for you.

358
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,013
你不应该来这里 
You shouldn't have come here.

359
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:56,019
我已经在外面等了2个小时了
I've been waiting outside for 2 hours.

360
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,030
他们不在这里
They're not here.

361
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,099
他们说的是真的吗
Is it true what they're saying?

362
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:13,026
亲爱的  你来这儿干什么
Kate, what did you come here for?

363
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:17,006
你为什么不告诉我  爸爸
Why didn't you tell me, dad?

364
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:20,067
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

365
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:23,007
我在做照片剪辑
I was making a scrapbook,

366
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:26,041
准备你生日的时候给你个惊喜
a surprise for your birthday,

367
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,053
我给你的一个同事打了电话  
so I called one of your C.O.s

368
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,046
得到了一些你穿制服的照片
to get some pictures of you in uniform.

369
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:33,067
他给我的那些照片背面有日期
The pictures that he sent me had dates on the back,

370
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,079
你在朝鲜的照片
photos of you in Korea

371
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:40,043
在我出生前的4个月  
up until four months before I was born.

372
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:49,012
你为什么不告诉我Wayne才是我的亲生父亲
Why didn't you tell me that Wayne was my father?

373
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:54,071
为什么
Why?

374
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:06,086
我没有告诉你是因为我知道你会杀了他
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd kill him.

375
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:12,037
你的妈妈...
And your mother...

376
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:16,050
很爱他
loved him.

377
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,008
你5岁的时候  
You were 5 years old.

378
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:22,059
我想带你和我一起过
I wanted to take you along with me.

379
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,094
她不让我这么做
She wouldn't let me.

380
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:31,016
那你为什么不杀了他
So why didn't you kill him?

381
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:41,033
因为我从没想过要杀人
Because I don't have murder in my heart.

382
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:54,072
我不得不打电话告诉他们你来过
I'm gonna have to call them.

383
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:03,024
一小时之后再打行么
Can I have an hour?

384
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:25,055
再见  爸爸
Bye, daddy.

385
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:59,018
你能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

386
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,031
Sawyer?

387
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,069
Wayne?

388
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,057
我大概是疯了
I'm probably crazy,

389
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:37,048
这不要紧
and this doesn't matter,

390
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:40,083
但是可能你当时在那儿
but maybe you're in there.

391
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:45,060
不知怎么你问过我一个问题
Somehow you asked me a question.

392
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,076
你问我为什么...
You asked me why I...

393
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:53,099
为什么我那么做
why I did it.

394
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:59,070
那并不是因为你赶走了我爸爸
It wasn't 'cause you drove my father away

395
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,006
或是你那样看待我
or the way you looked at me

396
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:09,038
亦或者是你打我妈妈
or because you beat her.

397
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:14,036
而是因为我恨你是我的一部分
It was 'cause I hated that you were a part of me,

398
00:37:14,036 --> 00:37:17,056
由此我不能完美
that I would never be good,

399
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:20,066
由此我永远不能拥有美好的东西
that I would never have anything good.

400
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:23,011
并且每次我看着Sawyer
And every time that I look at Sawyer,

401
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:27,021
每次我都有些感觉
every time I feel something for him,

402
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:30,003
我看到了你  Wayne
I see you, Wayne,

403
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:34,039
让我觉得很恶心
and it makes me sick.

404
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:42,022
那是我听过的最甜蜜的话
That's about the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

405
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:45,055
Sawyer?

406
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:50,014
那该死的Wayne是谁
Who the hell is Wayne?

407
00:37:58,048 --> 00:38:00,061
我在哪儿
Where am I?

408
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:04,024
在床上
A bunk bed?

409
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:10,000
是的  你是睡在床上
Yeah, you're in a bunk bed.

410
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,086
我们得救了吗
Are we saved?

411
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,088
没有  Sawyer
No, Sawyer.

412
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:22,036
还没有
Not yet.

413
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,024
怎么这么巧
What are the odds?

414
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:42,063
巧
The odds?

415
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:43,091
是啊
Yeah.

416
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:51,005
来  把这个按在桌上  按平
Here, hold this down on the table here, nice and flat.

417
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,086
我是说  想想看吧
I mean, think about it.

418
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:58,053
有人拍了这部影片
Somebody made this film.

419
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:05,009
有人又把它切了
Someone else cut this piece out.

420
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,048
我们坠机了
We crash.

421
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:07,070
飞机的两半
Two halves of the same plane

422
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,097
落在了岛上的不同位置
fall on different parts of the island.

423
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,051
你在那里  我在这里
You're over there. I'm over here.

424
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,058
现在那些失落的影片
And now here's the missing piece,

425
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:19,069
又回到了原来应该在的地方
right back where it belongs.

426
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:23,061
怎么这么巧啊
What are the odds?

427
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:29,049
不要把巧合错当成命运
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

428
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:44,082
你一定是在说笑
You've gotta be kidding me.

429
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:48,042
往这儿走
Air lock's over this way.

430
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,031
好了  承认了吧
Come on, admit it.

431
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:54,080
我们已经获救了
We've been rescued.

432
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:59,053
你碰到了  抱歉
You got it? Sorry.

433
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:02,070
小心点
Watch yourself.

434
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:14,030
真他妈的
Son of a bitch.

435
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:18,081
小心点  好吗
Watch yourself, okay?

436
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:24,059
好的
Okay.

437
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:28,077
又回到老地方了
Home sweet home.

438
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:30,095
是的
Yeah.

439
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:35,048
我真的认为你是故意和我说笑呢
I really thought you were yanking my chain.

440
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:38,007
你一直在笑什么
What do you keep smiling at?

441
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,067
你该剪头发了
You need a haircut.

442
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:44,057
真的吗
Really?

443
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:55,084
也许你该带我回舱子里去
Maybe you ought to take me back inside.

444
00:41:07,018 --> 00:41:10,086
你也看见了
You see that?

445
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,028
如果你说的是
If you mean the big-ass horse

446
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:20,069
站在丛林中的马  那我看到了
standing in the middle of the jungle then, yeah.

447
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:45,051
你认识那匹马吗  雀斑女
You know that horse, freckles?

448
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,073
是的  我认识
Yeah, I do.

449
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:03,055
龙舌兰酒加奎宁水
Tequila and tonic.

450
00:42:03,055 --> 00:42:06,047
是你要喝的吧 
That's your drink, right?

451
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:08,051
那滋补品呢?
Where's the tonic?

452
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:12,074
那东西我们存货不多
We're running a little low on mixers.

453
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,083
你确定舍得把它浪费在我身上
Sure you want to waste that on me?

454
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:24,019
我想你也应该喝一杯
I figured you could use a drink.

455
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:27,071
当然
I know I could.

456
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:28,077
你要试着说服我
You're gonna try to convince me that

457
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:33,027
这里没人恨我
everyone here doesn't hate me?

458
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,092
那你就先说服我
Only if you're gonna try to convince me

459
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:39,052
这个世界上没有女人是疯的
that every woman in the world's not crazy.

460
00:42:46,091 --> 00:42:48,099
当警报响起
When the alarm sounds,

461
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,079
你或你的搭档必须输入数字
either you or your partner must input the code.

462
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,027
而且你和你的搭档最好轮班
It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts.

463
00:42:57,027 --> 00:42:59,069
这样你们就可以时刻保持警觉
In this manner, you will both still stay as fresh and alert.

464
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:03,067
最重要的就是当警报响起时
It is most important that when the alarm sounds,

465
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:06,031
密码要准确并及时的输入电脑
the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion.

466
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:07,019
就是这儿了
Here it comes.

467
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,015
除了输入数字
Do not attempt to use the computer

468
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:13,002
不要尝试使用电脑做任何其他事情
for anything else other than the entering of the code.

469
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:15,057
它只有这么一个用途
This is its only function.

470
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:19,018
由于做3号站的工作而产生的隔绝感
The isolation that attends the duties associated with station 3,

471
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:21,037
会使你们试着利用电脑
may tempt you to try and utilize the computer
