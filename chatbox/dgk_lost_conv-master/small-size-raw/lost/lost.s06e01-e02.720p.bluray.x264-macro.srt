00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:31,291
好吧 这个... 也不是个烈性饮料
Well, it's... it's not a very strong drink.

32
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,380
- 谁也别告诉 - 这是我们的秘密

00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:44,383
白色闪光 头痛 听不见声音
White flash. Headache. Can't hear.

154
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,101
- 我以前也发生过 - Jack和其他人呢?
- Happened to me before. - What about Jack and everyone else?

155
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,835
- 他们也穿越时空了吗? - 我不知道
- Did they move through time, too? - I don't know.

156
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,600
他们开了另外一辆货车去工地了
They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.

157
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,696
接着我就听到了枪声...
And then I heard gunfire...

158
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,497
- 嘘! - 你说过我们的飞机再也不会坠到这个岛上的!
- Shh! - You said that our plane would never crash on this island!

159
00:14:55,497 --> 00:15:00,382
- 听到了吗 兄弟? 是Sawyer - 呆这儿陪着Sayid
- You hear that, dude? It's Sawyer. - Stay here with Sayid.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,285
炸弹肯定爆炸了
The bomb must've gone off.

161
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:09,205
你觉得原子弹爆炸了以后我们还能站在这儿?
You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!

162
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,263
我不懂
I don't know.

163
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:13,866
没错! 你不懂! 你终于承认不懂了!
That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!

164
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,337
Jack啊!
Jack!

165
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:18,047
Sayid需要帮助
Sayid needs help.

166
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,012
- 他在哪儿? - 在货车那儿 Hurley陪着他
- Where is he? - With Hurley at the van.

167
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,139
- 两分钟路程 - 救命
- Two minutes away. - Help.

168
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,309
他还在流血 我们不知道该怎么办
He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.

169
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,006
救命
Help me.

170
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,211
怎么说啊 医生?
So what do you say, doc?

171
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,382
又想到一个好主意来救Sayid了?
Got another great idea to save Sayid?

172
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,806
- 没准周围又埋了一颗核弹 - 嘿 闭嘴!
- Maybe there's a nuke laying around. - Hey, shut up!

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,622
救命
Help.

174
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,535
Juliet啊
Juliet!

175
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:50,864
James吗?
James?

176
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,860
噢 天呐
Oh, my god.

177
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,318
Juliet啊!
Juliet!

178
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,929
哦 天呐 哦 天呐 恶心死了
Oh, god. Oh, god, this is gross.

179
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,748
别担心 兄弟
Don't worry, dude.

180
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,562
一切都会好起来的
Everything's gonna be fine.

181
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,088
我死后...
When I die...

182
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:20,240
你觉得我会发生什么?
What do you think will happen to me?

183
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,336
别... 别说话了 哥们
Just... just try not to talk, dude.

184
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,495
我虐待过多少人自己都记不清了
I've tortured more people than I can remember.

185
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,936
我杀人
I murdered.

186
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,700
不管我去哪儿...
Wherever I'm going...

187
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,486
都不会是好地方
It can't be very pleasant.

188
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,465
- Sayid 行了 - 我活该
- Sayid, come on. - I deserve it.

189
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,505
谁?
Hello?

190
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,927
Jin吗?
Jin?

191
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,391
Jin啊
Jin!

192
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,457
我有枪的!
I've got a gun!

193
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:05,191
我也知道怎么用!
And I know how to shoot it!

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,868
你好 Hugo
Hello, Hugo.

195
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,989
有时间吗?
You got a minute?

196
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,598

你盯着他们干吗?

197
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,560

他们看起来挺开心的

198
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,712

把衣服扣上

199
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:16,484
你在浪费时间 伙计
You're wasting your time, man.

200
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,585
这架飞机要是在大海中间坠落的话
This plane goes down in the ocean way out here,

201
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:24,242
我想我们的生存几率绝对为零
I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.

202
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:28,517
实际上 平静的海面再加一个好的飞行员
Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot,

203
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,584
我们可以在水面迫降的
We could survive a water landing.

204
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,147
还有 嗯 燃料罐浮力很大的
And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough

205
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,618
完全可以支持到我们上救生筏
To keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts.

206
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,089
怎么了?
What?

207
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,175
没什么 你知道的可真不少
No, it's just impressive you know that.

208
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,647
你在澳大利亚干吗了?
What were you doing in Australia?

209
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,118
生意还是度假?
Business or pleasure?

210
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:48,454
度假 你呢?
Pleasure. You?

211
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:52,697
我去处理一下和我妹妹糟糕的关系
I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship

212
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,837
结果是她不买我的帐
That it turns out she didn't want to get out of.

213
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,401
如此...
So...

214
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,424
我就在这儿了
Here I am.

215
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:03,761
那么说 你是来澳洲度假的了?
So what, you were just down under for vacation?

216
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,576
实际上 我是来徒步旅行的
Actually, I went on a walkabout.

217
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,964
是吗?
Really?

218
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,977
就像... 像鳄鱼邓迪似的?
Like... like Crocodile Cundee?&

219
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,885
不 不太像
No, not exactly.

220
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,012
但... 但是 嗯 相当激烈了
But... but, uh, it was pretty intense.

221
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,932
我们... 我们在内陆呆了10天
We... we spent ten days in the outback

222
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,674
嗯 除了包和刀什么都不带
And, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives.

223
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:24,236
我们燃起篝火 在星空下入睡
We slept under the stars and made our own fires,

224
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:26,150
自己打猎
Hunted our own food.

225
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,045
哇
Wow.

226
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,737
我要是两天不带电话就活不了
I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.

227
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,741
你不是在跟我开玩笑吧 对吗?
You're not pulling my leg, are ya?

228
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,556
我为什么要跟你开玩笑呢?
Why would I pull your leg?

229
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:45,291
我的事完了之后 就跟你混一阵
This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.

230
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:21,160
你不用盯着火看了
You can stop staring at the fire.

231
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,415
Jacob死了
Jacob's gone.

232
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,683
他死了
He's gone.

233
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:31,227
他为什么不还手?
Why didn't he fight back?

234
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,752
他为什么让我杀他?
Why did he let me just kill him?

235
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,286
我想是他知道他已经被打败了
I guess he knew that he was beaten.

236
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,896
Ben啊...
Ben...

237
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,440
我要你出去
I want you to go outside

238
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,048
告诉Richard 我想跟他谈谈
And tell Richard that I need to talk to him.

239
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,072
跟他谈... 什么?
Talk to him about... What?

240
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:56,315
那是我和Richard的事
That's between me and Richard.

241
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:04,145
- 没有别的原因 - 不 事情不应该那样的
- There's no other reason. - No, that's not how it's gonna be.

242
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,856
- 你应该... - 你不能进去
- You have to... - you're not going in there.

243
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:10,370
听我说 我已经决定了 现在我要你...
Listen to me. I already did. Now I'm asking you to...

244
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,633
到那边去...
Body over by the...

245
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:16,043
只要退回去一点 好吗?
Just back up a little. Okay?

246
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,733
他们是谁?
Who are they?

247
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,818
除了那些
Other than the fact

248
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,634
和我们一起在Ajira航班上的人
that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us,

249
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,761
我所知道的就是 他们打晕了我
All I know is they knocked me out

250
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,638
把我关进了某个小屋
And dragged my ass to some cabin,

251
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,995
他们很快又把屋子给烧了 然后
Which they promptly burned, then...

252
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:35,248
把我和棺材里那个死人又带到了这里
Brought me here along with the dead guy in the box.

253
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:38,064
他们说他们是好人
They say they're the good guys.

254
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:43,379
我也不信
I'm not buying it either.

255
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,856
听我说 嘿! 听我说 给我仔细听着
Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully.

256
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:50,534
除非Jacob邀请 否则谁也不能进去
No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.

257
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:54,739
Richard 我们之所以来这里 就是因为Jacob邀请了我们
Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.

258
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,327
问我那该死的雕像下边有什么
Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue

259
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,598
- 并不代表你是头儿 - 那谁是呢?
- Doesn't mean you're in charge. - Then who is?

260
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,759
Richard啊
Richard.

261
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,068
嘿 Ben
Ben.

262
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,477
里面怎么了?
What happened in there?

263
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,249
一切都好
Everything's fine.

264
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,721
John想跟你谈谈
John wants to speak to you.

265
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:13,309
- Jacob还好吧? - 不好意思 你哪位?
- Is Jacob all right? - I'm sorry. Who are you?

266
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,437
- 回答她的问题 Ben - 哦 那当然 Jacob很好
- Answer her question, Ben. - Well, of course Jacob's all right.

267
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:20,545
他们两个都在里面 John想跟你谈谈
They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.

268
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,496
- John想跟我谈谈? - 是的
- John wants to talk to me? - That's right.

269
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,635
Richard 你干什么? 我不明白
Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.

270
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,142
哦 跟John谈话我很高兴
Well, I'm happy to talk to John.

271
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:32,338
但在我跟他谈之前 你最好先跟他谈谈
But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.

272
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,591
坚持住 Juliet! 我们马上到!
Hang on, Juliet! We're coming!

273
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,253
呃!
Uhh!

274
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:08,107
Jin 手电筒
Jin. Flashlight.

275
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:15,378
把这根柱子移开 我就能下去了
We can move this beam. Think I can get down there.

276
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:33,193
唉! 这太重了 得拿点东西把这个拉起来 Jin!
Uhh! Too heavy. We need something to pull it. Jin!

277
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:36,566
货车! 里面有条链子 拿过来!
The van! There's chains in it. Go get 'em!

278
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,767
老兄 你在干啥?
Where you going, dude?

279
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,284
你跑这儿干啥?
And what are you doing here?

280
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,707
我在计程车里见过你
I mean, I meet you in a taxi,

281
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,343
你知道我的一切
and you know everything about me,

282
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,695
你还给了我一张
and you give me a plane ticket,

283
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:56,805
刚好能把我送回岛上的机票
which just so happens to get me back on this island.

284
00:23:56,805 --> 00:24:00,234
你怎么知道将要发生的事?
How'd you know that was gonna happen?

285
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,028
听得到吗?
Hello?

286
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:10,593
能听得到吗? 为什么不回答我的问题?
Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?

287
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,501
我朋友Jin随时都可能回来
Look, my friend Jin's gonna be here any second,

288
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,537
- 你最好不要再忽略我了... - 你朋友Jin见不到我了
- So you better stop ignoring me... - Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.

289
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,180
为啥?
Why not?

290
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,241
因为我一小时前就死了
Because I died an hour ago.

291
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:24,024
抱歉 老兄 不好受吧
Sorry, dude. That sucks.

292
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,417
谢谢
Thanks.

293
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,461
怎么死的?
How'd you die?

294
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:31,791
被一个已经厌倦了我陪伴的老朋友杀的
I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.

295
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:39,107
你又想让我做什么疯狂的事了 是吧?
You want me to do something crazy again, don't you?

296
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:42,186
不 Hugo 我要你救活Sayid
No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.

297
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:45,736
- 所以Jin去找Jack 让他... - Jin帮不了的
- Well, that's why Jin went to go get Jack, to... - Jin can't help him.

298
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,763
你要把Sayid带到庙里
You need to take Sayid to the temple.

299
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:50,584
这是他活命的唯一机会
That's the only chance he's got.

300
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:52,545
其他的人在那也会安全的

这不是要困住你们 是防止他进来
This isn't to keep you in. It's to keep him out.

743
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:59,539
"他"是谁?

01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:37,061
你自己杀不了他
You couldn't kill him yourself,

750
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,028

01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:43,233
我没有骗你做任何事
I didn't make you do anything.

01:13:46,336 --> 01:13:48,194
你应该知道...
You should know...

753
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,003
当你杀他的时候 他很困惑

754
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:54,891
我难以相信Jacob会感到困惑
I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.

755
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:57,338
我不是说Jacob
I'm not talking about Jacob.

你想知道他那时在想什么吗 当你...

残忍地勒死他的时候 Benjamin?

759
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:14,025
他临死前头脑中想的是什么?
What the last thought that ran through his head was?

760
01:14:14,056 --> 01:14:17,965
"我不明白"
"I don't understand."

761
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:23,685
这是否是你听过的最可怜的事情?
Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard?

762
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:28,341
不过 从某方面看 这也讲得过去
But it's fitting in a way.

763
01:14:28,344 --> 01:14:31,232
因为John第一次踏上这小岛的时候
Because when John first came to the island,

764
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:33,849
他是一个内心极度悲伤的人
he was a very sad man.

765
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,653
一位受害者
A victim

766
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:38,854
在得知自己力有不及时 伤心欲绝...
shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do...

767
01:14:38,886 --> 01:14:40,981
即使这是事实
even though they were right.

768
01:14:42,013 --> 01:14:43,797
他软弱
He was weak

769
01:14:43,828 --> 01:14:48,605
可悲 内心支零破碎
and pathetic and irreparably broken.

770
01:14:49,436 --> 01:14:52,566
但是尽管如此
But despite all that,

771
01:14:52,597 --> 01:14:55,246
他仍有闪光之处
there was something admirable about him.

772
01:14:55,277 --> 01:14:59,698
他是众人中 唯一一个不愿离开小岛的人
He was the only one of them who didn't want to leave.

773
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,888
唯一一个意识到
The only one who realized

774
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:05,237
他已抛弃的岛外生活是
how pitiful the life he'd left behind

775
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:07,800
多么地可悲
actually was.

776
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,488
嗯
Hmm.

777
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,004
你想要什么?
What do you want?

778
01:15:18,846 --> 01:15:21,287
这个 极具讽刺意味 Ben
Well, that's the great irony here, Ben,

779
01:15:21,328 --> 01:15:22,337
因为...
because...

780
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:26,638
我想要的 是John Locke唯一不想要的
I want the one thing that John Locke didn't.

781
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:32,800
我要回家
I want to go home.

782
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,345
再见 兄弟
Goodbye, dude.

783
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:49,051
你要是想说会儿话
If you ever wanna talk,

784
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,538
我就在旁边
I'm around.

785
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:02,931
什么?
What?

786
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:06,850
没什么
Nothing.

787
01:16:21,966 --> 01:16:23,620
嘿
Hey.

788
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,634
我们在哪?
Where are we?

789
01:16:29,076 --> 01:16:31,065
在寺庙里
We're in a temple.

790
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:34,075
我们再次被The Others抓了
We got caught by The Others again.

791
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:34,966
是啊
Yeah.

792
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:39,093
只有这次 他们是在保护我们
Only this time, they're protecting us.

793
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:42,020
我这样认为
I think.

794
01:16:42,051 --> 01:16:43,351
当然了
Of course they are.

795
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:45,145
你还好吗?
You all right?

796
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,176
十分抱歉
I'm so sorry.

797
01:17:09,255 --> 01:17:11,757
你知道你在舱门那里说了什么吗?
You know what you said back at the hatch?

798
01:17:12,488 --> 01:17:14,828
他只是想帮助我们
He's just trying to help us.

799
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:18,821
我不会杀死Jack
I am not gonna kill Jack.

800
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,472
他理应坐在这块岩石上自我谴责
He deserves to suffer on this rock

801
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:26,621
和我们其余的人一样
just like the rest of us.

802
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:31,342
是啊
Yeah.

803
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:36,607
我知道 而且... 你以为我能预知这事的发生吗?
I know, and... you think I knew this was gonna happen?

804
01:17:37,048 --> 01:17:40,121
我这么快计划好 就是因为想要结束它
I scheduled it so soon because want to get it over with.

805
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:42,402
所有乘客请注意...
Attention all passengers...

806
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:44,008
我不知道 妈妈
I don't know, Mom.

807
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,379
他没在这里 所以我不知道让你跟他们如何解释
He's not here, so I can't tell you what to tell them,

808
01:17:46,452 --> 01:17:50,354
只能告诉你 我们没有他办不了事情
other than we can't have the service without him.

809
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:51,743
嗯
Yeah.

810
01:17:52,074 --> 01:17:55,488
如果有新消息 我会打电话给你的
I will call you if I hear anything.

811
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,818
你掉了什么?
What did you lose?

812
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:01,831
你说什么?
Excuse me?

813
01:18:02,123 --> 01:18:05,387
哦 他们弄丢了我一个包 你呢?
Oh, they lost one of my bags. What about you?

814
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:09,234
要是我告诉你 你肯定不会信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

815
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:10,903
试试呗
Try me.

816
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,299
他们弄丢了我爸爸
They lost my father.

817
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:17,762
什么?
I'm sorry?

818
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:19,839
他几天前在澳大利亚过世
He died in Australia a couple days ago,

819
01:18:19,901 --> 01:18:23,094
然后 呃 我坐飞机来接他的遗体
and, um, I flew down to get him.

820
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,868
节哀顺变
My condolences.

821
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:30,792
哎
Yo.

822
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:33,063
棺材本应在悉尼上机
The coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney,

823
01:18:33,094 --> 01:18:34,786
然而却没有
but it didn't.

824
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:36,308
显然 他被落在了运输途中
Apparently, he's somewhere in transit,

825
01:18:36,391 --> 01:18:37,359
他们敷衍说
which is their way of saying

826
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:40,491
他们不知道他究竟在哪里
they have no idea where the hell he is.

827
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:42,730
呃 他们怎么会知道呢?
Well, how could they know?

828
01:18:43,903 --> 01:18:45,482
是他们核准棺材登机的
They're the ones that checked him in.

829
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:47,286
我是说 他们肯定有什么追踪系统
I mean, they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.

830
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:49,069
不 我不是在说棺材
No, I'm not talking about the coffin.

831
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,051
我是说 他们怎么知道他在哪里?
I mean, how could they know where he is?

832
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:58,368
他们没弄丢你爸爸 他们只是弄丢了他的遗体
They didn't lose your father. They just lost his body.

833
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:13,024
不管怎样 你比我惨
Either way, your story beats the hell out of mine.

834
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:15,618
我包里不过是一捆刀
All that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives.

835
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:16,706
谢谢
Thanks.

836
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:18,461
你是推销员?
You some kind of salesman?

837
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:21,081
嗯 差不多
Yeah, somethin' like that.

838
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:27,379
呃 很高兴和你聊天 我... 我希望你能找到那具棺材
Well, it's nice talking to you. I... I hope you find that coffin.

839
01:19:28,121 --> 01:19:29,549
我希望你能找到你的刀
I hope you find your knives.

840
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:30,574
嗯 谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

841
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:33,776
介意我问下 你发生了什么事么?
Mind if I ask what happened to you?

842
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:38,350
抱歉 之所以有这一问 是因为我是个脊椎外科医生
I'm sorry. I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon.

843
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:39,340
我... 我不是想...
I... I didn't mean to...

844
01:19:39,403 --> 01:19:42,194
哦 不 别介意 呃...
Oh, no, don't worry about it. Uh...

845
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,692
呃 手术对我没用
Uh, surgery isn't gonna do anythg to help me.

846
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:47,580
呃 我这情况回天乏术
Uh, my condition is irreversible.

847
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:50,310
万事皆有转机
Nothing's irreversible.

848
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:57,760
呃...
Um...

849
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,414
如果你还想咨询一下的话... 就 呃 给我打个电话
If you ever want a consult... just, uh, give me a call.

850
01:20:06,082 --> 01:20:07,857
这是我家里的电话
It's on the house.

别开枪! 别杀他!
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!

858
01:21:03,975 --> 01:21:05,825
明明该眼见为实
I'm seein' it,

859
01:21:06,456 --> 01:21:08,827
但我却不敢置信
but I'm still not believin' it.

860
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,244

- 嗯 - 我们需要和你单独谈谈

867

如果你有话要跟我说 直说就是
If you've got something to say to me, then say it.

868
01:22:38,299 --> 01:22:39,875
否则 就别烦我
Otherwise, just leave me alone.

869
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:42,233
我想你还没搞明白状况
I don't think you're understanding me here.

870
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:44,497
我是礼貌相邀

因为我们得好好谈谈
Because we are going to have this conversation,

874
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:55,873
- 但不在这里谈 - 这样行了吧?

875
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:04,927
Jack啊!
