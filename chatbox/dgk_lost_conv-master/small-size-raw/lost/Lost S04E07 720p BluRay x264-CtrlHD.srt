这个和Minkowski一点关系也没有

船长对你们俩逃出医务室

进入我们的无线电室感到很不高兴

我们没想跑  那个门本来就是开着的
We didn't bust out. The door was left open.

40
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,035
我们觉得是你开的门

为什么他们还没有回来?
Why haven't they come back?

53
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,082
也许他们正和船一起回来
Perhaps they are returning with the ship.

54
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,086
来吧
Now come on...

现在讨论孩子的名字会带来厄运

我不想说名字的事

我想她不会想去解释

她为什么要去一个毒气工厂

Juliet告诉Jack说那是个发电站

他们为什么要去那里?

关掉它  关闭毒气

我猜他们是去赚女童子军学分

你觉得他们真的会救我们吗?

三天前

00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,004
到底是  还是不是?
Are you or are you not going to rescue us?

141
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,007

But when the camp split up,

317
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,021
我知道她肯定会跟着Locke走
I was sure that she'd want to go with locke.

318
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,074
她怎么会愿意冒再次生病得危险
Why would she want to leave the island

319
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,065
离开这座岛呢？
And risk getting sick again?

320
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,006
那你为什么还要Jack这边?
Uh, then why do you stay with jack?

321
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,099
因为这样做是对的
Because it was the right thing to do.

322
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,089
Locke?
Locke?

323
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,060
他是个杀人犯
He's a murderer.

324
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,088
看到了吧  这些全是因果报应  Jin
See, it's all about karma, jin.

325
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,000
你知道什么是因果报应吗
Do you know karma?

326
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,089
你做了不好的选择  不好的事情就会发生
You make bad choices, bad things happen to you.

327
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,029
但如果你做了正确的选择  好的事情就会发生
But you make good choices, and then good--

328
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,029
你钓到了一条
Hey! hey, hey, hey! you got one.

329
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,006
就在那儿  使劲拉
Yeah. here, pull it .

330
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:49,069
哇  看看
Wow, look at that!

331
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:52,059
看到了吗?  这就是因果报应
Ah, you see? now that's karma.

332
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:56,039
我们肯定都是好人  对吧
We must be the good guys, huh?

333
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,054
还要等多久啊？
How long's that gonna go on for, eh?

334
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:17,021
他妈的  他们就找出是什么故障原因吗？
Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?

335
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,023
那不是机器发出的声音
That sound is not mechanical.

336
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,086
什么  你认为是有人故意弄出的声音
What, you think somebody's doing that?

337
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,057
有人在那管子上敲来敲去？
Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?

338
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,082
就是这样
That's exactly what I think.

339
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,048
先生们
Gentlemen...

340
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,045
谢谢你们的耐心
Thanks for your patience.

341
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:35,086
船长现在能见你们了
The captain would like to see you now.

342
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,093
直升机哪去了?
Where's the helicopter?

343
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,002
Lapidus开去执行任务去了
Lapidus is running an errand.

344
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,089
什么任务
What kind of errand?

345
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:00,023
我只是个医生  我不知道他去哪儿了
I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.

346
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,091
他回岛上了?
Did he go to the island?

347
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:04,066
你认为他还有什么地方可以去吗
You know anywhere else he could land?

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,031
他去做什么
What's he going to do?

349
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,057
我说了  我只是个医生
I said I'm just a doctor.

350
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,013
Lapidus有留下什么话吗?
What did lapidus say?

351
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:15,066
-他什么都没说  -她在干什么
He didn't say anything. what is she doing?!

352
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,093
那个女人刚刚从船上跳下去了
That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!

353
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:28,025
别傻站在那  你们他妈的怎么了？
Don't just stand there! what's the matter with you people?!

354
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:32,017
拿绳子来  你们怎么都不动啊  拿绳子来
Get a rope! why aren'tou doing anything?! bring a rope!

355
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,024
绳子!  拿绳子!
Get a rope! get a pe!

356
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:36,083
-好了  -她刚刚跳下去了
Stop! she just jumped!

357
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,099
结束了  她已经死了
It's over. she's gone.

358
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,099
每个人都回到自己的岗位去
Everybody get back to your posts.

359
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,051
这是命令
That was an order.

360
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,022
我是Gault船长
I'm captain gault.

361
00:24:58,022 --> 00:25:00,013
我猜你们两个有点想不通吧
I suppose you two have a few questions.

362
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:10,050
-我有什么能帮你们  -什么?
So what can I do for you? what?

363
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:13,025
-你们说想跟我谈谈  -就从刚才那事说起
You boys said you wanted to speak with me. let's just start with

364
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:16,021
为什么一个女人跳海了却没有人去阻止她
Why a woman jumped over side of your ship,and you did nothing to stop it

365
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:19,047
我没有跳也没有命令我的船员跳
I didn't jump or order my crew to jump in

366
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:22,028
因为我不想再失去更多人
Because I didn't want to lose any more peoe.

367
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,081
这里到底发生了什么
What exactly is going on here?

368
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:30,098
我的一些船员感染了一种
Some of my crew has been dealing with...

369
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,096
怎么说呢
What might best be described

370
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,020
一种叫幽居病的病
As a heightened case of cabin fever.

371
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,098
我认为这跟靠近这个岛屿的原因有关
I think it's got something to do

372
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,007
那为什么你不掉头？
With the close proximity of the island. why don't you turn around, then?

373
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,078
我试过了  但是有个船上有个破坏者
I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board,

374
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:48,019
他在引擎上做了手脚
And he's de one hell a job on my engines.

375
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,021
我已经叫我的船员加班加点地去维修了
I've got my creworking around the clock to repair them.

376
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,013
然后你就会带我们的人回去？
And then you'll take our people home?

377
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,029
然后我们转移到安全的水域
Then we move to safer waters.

378
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,078
这是我所有的命令
That all are my orders.

379
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,033
你大概不会告诉我们  谁下了这些命令？
And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?

380
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,097
当然会  是Charles Widmore
Sure, I ll. charles widmore.

381
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:08,054
这是Charles Widmore的船？
This is charles widmore's boat?

382
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,006
对  你认识他的
That's right. you know him.

383
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,041
你们有人知道这是什么吗?
Do either of you know what this is?

384
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:34,057
是一个飞行数据记录器  就是俗话说的黑匣子
It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.

385
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:37,016
对  就是黑匣子
That's exactly what it is.

386
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,076
有意思的是
Now here's the funny thing.

387
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:44,060
这是大洋航空815航班上的黑匣子
This black box comes from oceanic flight 8-1-5.

388
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,038
一艘打捞船从海底打捞出来的
A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean.

389
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,072
Widmore先生耗费了大量的人力财力
It took a considerable amount of mr. widmore's resources

390
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:56,063
才搞到手
To procure it.

391
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,090
这个黑匣子是在一起空难中发现
It was found with the wreckage of the plane,

392
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:02,047
324名乘客全部死亡
Along with all 324 dead passengers.

393
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,088
然而故事还没完
That's not the complete story,

394
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,065
你们都清楚 Jarrah先生
As you are well aware, mr. jarrah,

395
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:12,082
你们活生生地站在这里
Given the fact that you're standing here, breathing.

396
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,044
那次空难很明显是计划好的
The wreckage was obviously staged.

397
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:21,030
现在你们可以想象一下
Now can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower

398
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,071
花了多少人力物力才制造了这个假象
Go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude?

399
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,039
空难的假象
Faking the recovery of a plane crash?

400
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:31,056
让324个家庭因为一个谎言
Putting 324 families through a grieving process

401
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,005
痛不欲生?
Based on a lie?

402
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,021
但是更烦人的事
But what's even more disturbing--

403
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,051
到底在哪里才能让一个人
Where exactly does one come across

404
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:42,010
发现324个人的尸体
324 dead bodies?

405
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,035
Jarrah先生  Hume先生
And that, mr. jarrah, mr. hume,

406
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,078
那  就是我们要找到Benjamin Linus
Is just one of the many reasons

407
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,069
的原因之一
We want benjamin linus.

408
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,057
对不起
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:10,066
我不得不想尽办法来阻止你
I had to stop you any way I could.

410
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:15,049
这不是你的地盘  你没权阻止我
It wasn't your place to stop us

411
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,041
我知道你不相信我
I know you don't trust me,

412
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:20,055
但是你需要离开这座岛  我们都需要
But you need tget off is island. we all do.

413
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:22,066
你想离开？
You want to leave?

414
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,019
做梦都想
More than anything.

415
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,080
我不知道那边那艘船能不能带我们离开
I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not,

416
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,094
但总有一丝希望
But it's something.

417
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,070
我需要回家

418

Sun
Sun...

420
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:42,067
再接下来的三周里

你会不断的出现想呕吐的现象

在那之后的一周里  你会感觉到呼吸急促
A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath

423
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,052

再之后  Sun  你会死的
And then, sun, you will die.

427
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,001
当你的心脏停止跳动时
And when your heart stops beating...

428
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,099
肚子里的孩子也活不了了
So will the baby's.

429
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,079
Sun  这就是我为什么要阻止你
And that, sun, is why it is my business,

430
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,040
因为你是我的病人
Because you are my patient.

431
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,035
如果你真的去了
If you go...

432
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:22,015
你会死的
You will die...

433

然后你的孩子就没了
And your baby will never be born.

434

不要
No

436

你不知道
You don't understand...

437
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:46,094
使用药物就很难顺产的
The medication makes a natural birth difficult

438
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:49,034
不  不行  要等到JIN...
No, no! Not until Jin

439
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,082
我们必须做手术了
We've got to get to surgery!

440

00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,085
出奇的友好
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

这船没动
Th ship isn't moving.

00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:03,080
那玩意儿怎么还在那  该死
