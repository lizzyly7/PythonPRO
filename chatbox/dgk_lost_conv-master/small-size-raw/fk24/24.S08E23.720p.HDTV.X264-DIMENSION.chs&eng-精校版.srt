00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,099
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,099
你在找谁
Who is it you're looking for?

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,058
一个能告诉我所有涉案人员名单的人
Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,011
如果我死了  我要你把真相公之于众
I need you to break the story in case I don't make it.

7
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,097
如果让达莉亚·哈桑发觉
If Dalia Hassan finds out

8
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:24,026
俄罗斯人跟她丈夫的死脱不了干系
that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband,

9
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,015
她决不会签署协议的
she'll never sign the agreement.

10
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:27,046
我需要跟你母亲通话
I need to speak to your mother.

11
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:29,080
此事关系到谋杀令尊的真凶
It's about the people who really murdered your father.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,032
我们知道凶手是谁
We know who is responsible.

13
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,015
但你不知道
What you don't know is,

14
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:35,074
这些凶手听命于一群俄罗斯间谍
those people were working under the orders of Russian agents.

15
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,051
鲍尔跟梅瑞狄斯·里德取得了联络
Bauer made contact with Meredith Reed.

16
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,096
-天哪  -您必须给她的出版商打电话
- My God. - You need to call her publisher

17
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:43,093
并要求他们不要报道此事
and demand that they do not run the story.

18
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:45,092
你在建议我封住媒体的嘴吗
You're suggesting muzzling the press?

19
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,083
如果您不动用白宫的力量
If you don't use the power of your office

20
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,077
阻止此事见报
to shut this story down,

21
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:53,046
损失的将不止是您的和平进程
your peace agreement won't be the only casualty.

22
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,056
我需要你与联邦调查局取得联系
I need you to contact the FBI.

23
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,010
让他们找到里德
Have them locate Reed

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,052
并截获她声称拥有的任何证据
and seize whatever evidence she purports to have.

25
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,053
梅瑞狄斯·里德  联邦调查局
Meredith Reed? FBI.

26
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:03,031
你被逮捕了
You're under arrest.

27
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,071
-我们走吧  -但我...
- Let's go. - But I...

28
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,022
你说的没错
You were right about Jack.

29
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:07,072
确实有人在帮助杰克
He is working with somebody.

30
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,075
是詹姆斯·理查尔  前中情局情报特工
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA Op.

31
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,066
我们已经找到他在梅瑟大街的住所
We found him living in a place on Mercer Street.

32
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:14,060
被我们挖出来  他一定不会高兴的
He's not gonna be happy we tracked him down.

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,081
我要你去跟他谈谈
I need you to talk to him.

34
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,046
让他说出杰克的下落
Get him to tell us where Jack is.

35
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:19,078
你能处理好吗  或者你还没想好该站哪边
Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides?

36
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:22,088
我跟你一样想让真相大白于天下  算上我
I want to expose this cover-up as much as you. I'm in.

37
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,022
那是杰克·鲍尔
That's Jack Bauer!

38
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,036
给我起来  否则我就地宰了你
Get up. I could just kill you right here.

39
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,064
你知道那个俄罗斯政府内部
You know the name of the person inside

40
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,029
负责此事的人的名字
the Russian government who's giving the orders.

41
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,022
告诉我那个名字
I want that name.

42
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:37,042
-杰克  -快告诉我名字
- Jack...  - Give me the name!

43
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,000
我说  我说  
I'll tell you.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,033
-4  3...  -是米哈伊尔·诺瓦科维奇
- Four. Three... - Mikhail Novakovich!

45
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,013
诺瓦科维奇在哪
Where's Novakovich?

46
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,044
他死了
He's dead.

47
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:45,023
鲍尔进来就开枪
Bauer just came in shooting.

48
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:48,055
米哈伊尔·诺瓦科维奇刚被杰克·鲍尔给杀了
Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer.

49
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,010
什么
What?

50
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,069
对鲍尔来说
As far as, uh, bauer is concerned,

51
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,054
做了诺瓦科维奇就完事了
the trail ended with Novakovich.

52
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:57,002
那么  鲍尔还不知道
Then Bauer has no idea

53
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:59,062
诺瓦科维奇是遵从我的命令行事的  对吗
that Novakovich was operating under my orders?

54
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,015
是的
None.

55
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,058
如果你这么担心鲍尔的话
If you're so worried about Bauer,

56
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:04,088
就不应该下令杀掉蕾妮·沃克
you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker.

57
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:11,075
以下事件发生于下午两点到三点间
The following takes place between 2:00 P.M. and 3:00 P.M.

58
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,027
事件实时发生
Events occur in real time.

59
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:28,045
阿洛
Arlo.

60
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,085
科尔  我刚得到一条初步的信息
Cole, I just picked up a preliminary flash.

61
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,075
杰克在诺瓦克维奇下榻的酒店里杀了他
Jack murdered Novakovich at his hotel,

62
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,061
以及他的六个保镖
and six of his security guards.

63
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:35,029
据一名目击者称
According to a witness,

64
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,026
杰克以一己之力做掉七人
Jack killed all seven men on his own.

65
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,084
然后就此从我们的视野里消失了
Then fell right back off the radar.

66
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:42,026
伊登找不到他的任何踪迹
Eden can't find any trace of him.

67
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,054
克罗伊知道这事吗
Does Chloe know about this?

68
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:44,047
我刚向她报告了此事
I just talked to her,

69
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,052
她应该马上就到联合国总部了
and she should be at the U.N. any minute.

70
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,056
科尔  我知道我们必须拿到杰克手上的证据
Cole, I know that we need this evidence that Jack has,

71
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:53,029
但这个凶案现场形同屠宰场
but this crime scene is a slaughterhouse.

72
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,092
克罗伊还坚持认为她能成功阻止事态发展吗
Does Chloe really still think she can pull this off?

73
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,088
如果还有人能说服杰克  那就只有克罗伊了
If anyone can talk Jack down, it's Chloe.

74
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,010
如果她办不到呢
And if she can't?

75
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,048
那我俩就得做好准备  不惜一切阻止他了
Then we're both prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him.

76
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,038
可连诺瓦科维奇那些保镖也阻止不了他
Even when Novakovich's whole security staff couldn't?

77
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,086
你还有什么好办法吗  阿洛
What do you want me to do, Arlo?

78
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,080
今天事件的真相得大白于天下
The truth about what went down today needs to get out,

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,096
但找不到杰克  一切都是枉然
and that's not going to happen unless we get to Jack.

80
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,040
我快到理查尔的公寓了
Look, I'm coming up on Ricker's apartment.

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,005
我准备硬闯了
I'm going in.

82
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,073
-科尔  -怎么了
- Cole. - What?

83
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:17,003
理查尔费尽周折才掩盖掉自己的行踪
Ricker went to a lot of trouble to disappear.

84
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,018
被你挖出来  他不会很高兴的
He's not going to like that you found him.

85
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,001
我也没指望他欢迎我
I'm not expecting him to.

86
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,066
您现在看到的是联合国广场花园以及演讲台
You're looking at the U.N. Plaza gardens and the podium

87
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,071
在那里签署和平协议的三方签署国
from which all three co-sponsors

88
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:38,019
在公开演讲结束后
of the peace treaty will address the public

89
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,052
各方将在联合国会议中心举行
following a private signing ceremony inside the U.N.'s

90
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,020
和平协议的签署仪式
Council Chamber.

91
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,098
俄罗斯总统尤里·萨瓦洛夫
Russian President Yuri Suvarov,

92
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,097
协议的第三方签署国
the third co-sponsor of the treaty,

93
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,062
正在前往联合国总部的途中
is en route to the U.N.

94
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,043
在那里  他将和泰勒总统
where he will join President Taylor

95
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:53,031
以及伊斯兰共和国代理总统达莉亚·哈桑一起...

理查尔先生  我是反恐小组的奥迪斯
Mr. Ricker, this is Agent Ortiz, CTU!

107
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,072
把门打开
Open that door.

108
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,025
在你开枪前
Before you pull that trigger,

109
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,079
你得知道些情况
there's something you ought to know.

110
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,069
如果我十五分钟内不打电话报告
I don't place a call in 15 minutes,

111
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,055
国内各个情报机构都将收到关于你的警报
every intelligence agency in the country gets alerted about you.

112
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:06,030
光被控军火交易就会让你在牢里待很长一段时间
Weapon charges alone will get you locked up for the duration,

113
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,044
或者你可以帮我们找到杰克·鲍尔
Or you can help us find Jack Bauer,

114
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,013
我们会对你的存在守口如瓶
and we'll keep our mouths shut.

115
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:17,023
你觉得自己是在保护他吗
You think you're protecting him?

116
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,082
对杰克·鲍尔的命令是格杀勿论
The order on Jack Bauer is shoot to kill.

117
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,050
他知道自己正惹上什么麻烦
He knew what he was getting himself into.

118
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,057
现在的杰克头脑并不清醒
Jack's not thinking straight.

119
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,075
我看过你的档案
Look, I read your file.

120
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,091
我知道杰克曾在大马士革救过你一命
I know Jack saved your life in Damascus.

121
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:36,008
而现在正是你报答他的时候
This is your opportunity to pay back that debt.

122
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,025
你知道这事会怎么收场  对吧
You know how this is gonna end, right?

123
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:48,089
如果今天杰克死了  都是你的错
If Jack dies today, it's on you.

124
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:02,025
等等
Wait a minute.

125
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,078
留步
Wait a minute.

126
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:17,091
谢谢  亚当
Thanks, Adam.

127
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:25,083
已被逮捕
Arrested

128
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,071
奥布赖恩主管  我是伯克探员
Director O'Brian, Agent Burke.

129
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,094
这里有一份修订后的安全评估给你
I have the revised security assessment for you.

130
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:31,043
长官  我注意到奥迪斯探员的名字
Ma'am, I noticed that Agent Ortiz's name

131
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,072
-出现在轮值表中  -没错
- was back on the duty roster. - That's right.

132
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,038
他不是因协助杰克·鲍尔被逮捕了吗
He was arrested for helping Jack Bauer.

133
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,059
他已获临时豁免来此协助我们工作
I got him a temporary clearance so he could help us out here.

134
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,071
他当初是设计联合国安保部署的主要负责人
He was the one who designed the U.N. protocols in the first place.

135
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,072
我们真的可以信任他吗
Do you really think we can trust him?

136
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,025
我不信任他就不会放他出来了
I wouldn't have gotten him a release if I didn't.

137
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,016
-明白  长官  -失陪了
- Yes, ma'am. - Excuse me.

138
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,047
-怎么了  -情况不妙  克罗伊
- What happened? - Not good, Chloe.

139
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,080
我觉得杰克正冲着萨瓦洛夫去了
I think Jack's targeting Suvarov.

140
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,067
-是理查尔说的吗  -是的
- Is that what Ricker said? - Yeah.

141
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,054
杰克在查尔斯·罗根身上放了个窃听器
Jack planted a bug on Charles Logan,

142
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:08,095
偷听到了他们俩的对话
overheard a conversation between the two men.

143
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,093
原来是萨瓦洛夫下令杀死蕾妮的
Turns out Suvarov's the one who gave the order for Renee to be killed.

144
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:15,023
理查尔有没有那次对话的录音
Does Ricker have a recording of that conversation?

145
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,065
没有  他一看见我过来
No. He wiped his system clean

146
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,069
就清空了系统
as soon as he saw me coming.

147
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,008
但他给杰克的监视设备录下了一切  作为备份
But the surveillance rig he gave Jack records everything to a backup,

148
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,033
所以杰克有一个副本
so Jack has a copy.

149
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,027
很好  我们会用到它的
Good. We're gonna need it.

150
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,053
白宫刚刚拘捕了梅瑞狄斯·里德
The White House just arrested Meredith Reed.

151
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:29,018
没收了她的数据卡
They confiscated a data card from her.

152
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,018
就是丹娜的证据
Dana's evidence.

153
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,008
没错  杰克现在手里的那份录音
Exactly. The recording that Jack has

154
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,021
是我们手里的唯一一份证据了
is the only proof we have now.

155
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:39,026
获取证据是我们的首要任务
that getting proof is our first priority anymore.

156
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,013
我们得发布一条关于杰克的警报
We have to put an alert out on Jack.

157
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:43,008
如果我们那么做的话  皮勒就会先下手
If we do that, then Pillar will get to him first.

158
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,038
他会杀了杰克  然后再毁掉录音
He'll kill Jack, and he'll destroy the recording.

159
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,051
克罗伊  我们不能就这么袖手旁观
Chloe, we can't stand by

160
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,091
任凭杰克刺杀俄罗斯总统
and let Jack assassinate the president of Russia.

161
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,055
当然不能  但是我们可以争取到时间
No, but we can buy ourselves time.

162
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,040
可以改变萨瓦洛夫的车队行驶路线
Can change Suvarov's motorcade route,

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,064
让他隐蔽在联合国总部内
sequester him in the U.N.

164
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,053
不给杰克得手的机会
Make it impossible for Jack to get to him.

165
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,092
只是萨瓦洛夫很快就要上演讲台了
Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna be standing at that podium soon,

166
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:04,037
而且一旦他的目标那么明显
and once he's exposed like that,

167
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,059
我们就没办法保护他了
we can't protect him.

168
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:08,002
还要一个多小时呢
That's not happening for over an hour.

169
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:09,004
如果到时候我们还没找到杰克
If we haven't found Jack by then,

170
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:10,019
那我们就可以发出警报了
then we can put out the alert.

171
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,011
这还是在冒很大的风险  克罗伊
It's still taking a big risk, Chloe.

172
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,026
好吧  改变萨瓦洛夫的行进路线
All right, get Suvarov's route changed.

173
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,081
但是他一到联合国总部
But you're putting me in charge of his security

174
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,055
你必须让我负责他的安全
as soon as he gets to the U.N.

175
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:19,069
你还有多远
How far out are you?

176
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,005
十分钟后到
I'll be there in ten.

177
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,003
好的
Okay.

178
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:44,009
长官  诺瓦科维奇的报道就要播出了
Sir, the flash about Novakovich is going out.

179
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,018
你说过你想在那之前要和总统谈谈
You wanted to speak with the president before that happened.

180
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,009
谢谢  杰森
Thank you, Jason.

181
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,083
有鲍尔的消息了吗
Do we know anything about Bauer?

182
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,049
没有
No. Nothing.

183
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,067
长官  如果您不介意我问个问题的话
If you don't mind me asking, sir.

184
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,010
您打算和总统怎么说
What are you going to tell the president?

185
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:04,079
我想是时候向总统坦白一切了
I think it's time she... she knows everything.

186
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,067
除了还在途中的萨瓦洛夫之外
All the delegates are present with the exception of Suvarov,

187
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,088
所有的代表都到了
who's still in transit.

188
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,031
他到之后就会马上告诉他详细的会议流程
He'll be given the details once he arrives.

189
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:22,042
等一下  蒂姆
Excuse me, Tim.

190
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,079
是  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,089
我马上就要开准备会了
I'm about to go into the protocol meeting.

192
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,008
出什么事了
What's going on?

193
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,026
我想让您先从我这里听说这条消息
I wanted you to hear this news from me first.

194
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:31,044
什么消息
What news?

195
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,084
我一直尽全力  让您与此事没有瓜葛
I tried to insulate you as long as I could,

196
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,052
保住您有推诿责任的余地  可...
preserve your plausible deniability, but...

197
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:38,040
你到底想要说什么  查尔斯
Just tell me what you're talking about, Charles.

198
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,007
杰克·鲍尔不只在
Jack Bauer isn't just trying to

199
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,014
搜集这次阴谋的证据
gather evidence about the conspiracy.

200
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,039
他要复仇
He's seeking retribution.

201
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,016
继续
Go on.

202
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:54,006
鲍尔刚谋杀了米哈伊尔·诺瓦科维奇
Bauer just murdered Mikhail Novakovich,

203
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,073
及其众多手下
along with a good number of his staff.

204
00:09:56,093 --> 00:10:00,061
那诺瓦科维奇是刺杀哈桑总统的幕后黑手吗
So Novakovich was responsible for the assassination of President Hassan?

205
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,011
是的  阁下
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

206
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,004
诺瓦科维奇是俄罗斯代表团的高级官员
Novakovich was the ranking member of the Russian Delegation.

207
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,074
萨瓦洛夫总统会要求给出解释
President Suvarov is going to demand an explanation.

208
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,094
实际上  他不会
Actually, he's not.

209
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,015
难道你想告诉我
Are you telling me

210
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:23,092
谋杀哈桑全都是萨瓦洛夫指使的吗
that Hassan's murder goes all the way up to Suvarov?

211
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:24,080
是的
Yes.

212
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:28,069
不过好消息是鲍尔还不知道这件事
But the good news is that Bauer doesn't know that.

213
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,073
你怎么能这么肯定
How can you be sure?

214
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:32,065
因为据一名目击者称
Because according to a witness,

215
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,073
鲍尔在诺瓦科维奇开口说话前
Bauer killed Novakovich

216
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,006
就把他杀了
before he could talk.

217
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,067
除了我以外  
And aside from me,

218
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,063
诺瓦科维奇是唯一一个知道
Novakavich is the only person who ever knew

219
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:43,026
萨瓦洛夫是幕后黑手的人
that Suvarov was calling the shots.

220
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:46,075
总统阁下  鲍尔已经达到了他的目的
Madam President, Bauer's finished what he started,

221
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:49,021
萨瓦洛夫也会很高兴解决了这个烫手的山芋
an-and Suvarov will be happy to sweep this under the rug.

222
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,050
和平协议可以按原计划进行下去了
An-and the peace agreement can go forward as planned.

223
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,067
这...
This is...

224
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:57,037
真的  我们不能再奢求更好的结果了
Really, we couldn't have asked for a better outcome.

225
00:10:57,037 --> 00:11:02,069
只是我要求达莉亚·哈桑和他的杀夫凶手握手
Except that I am asking Dalia Hassan to shake hands with her husband's murderer.

226
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,067
给萨瓦洛夫打电话
Call Suvarov.

227
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:07,068
告诉他我已经知道了他参与了这个阴谋
Tell him that I am aware of his involvement in this,

228
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,053
我会在签署仪式上和他见面
and that I will see him at the signing.

229
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:25,046
非常抱歉
My apologies.

230
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:31,007
让大家久等了
Thank you for waiting.

231
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,084
-电话怎么说的  -我已经告诉总统
- How did the call go? - I told the president

232
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:39,022
萨瓦洛夫也参与其中
about Suvarov's involvement, and, um...

233
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:42,082
而她也明白  自己没有别的选择
she understood-- not that she has an alternative.

234
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,082
是个好消息  长官
Well, that's good news, sir.

235
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:46,036
您的新特勤局侍卫队已经到了
Your new Secret Service detail's here

236
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:47,089
他们会护送您到联合国总部
to escort you to the U.N.

237
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,028
谢谢  杰森
Thank you, Jason.

238
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,093
长路漫漫  不过...
It's been a long road, but, uh...

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,037
曙光就在眼前
we're almost there.

240
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,069
有鲍尔的最新消息吗
Anything new on Bauer?

241
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,050
一个监控探头拍到了他离开诺瓦科维奇下榻的酒店
A security camera picked him up leaving Novakovich's hotel.

242
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,006
证实了伯科夫所说的
Confirmed what Berkov told us.

243
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,053
鲍尔在攻击时确实受伤了
Bauer was definitely wounded during the attack.

244
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,050
多严重
How badly?

245
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,062
严重到他需要接受治疗
Badly enough that he's gonna need treatment.

246
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:35,007
正在向医疗机构发布警报
Getting alerts out to medical facilities now.

247
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:36,094
好的  也让港务局和移民局知道
All right, also let Port Authority and INS know

248
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,070
鲍尔可能试图逃到国外去
Bauer might be trying to get out of the country.

249
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,034
我们会找到他的  这只不过是时间问题
We'll find him-- It's only a question of time.

250
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,014
也许会比你预想的还要快
Maybe a little quicker than you thought.

251
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,082
慢慢地拿出你的枪  递给我
Slowly, take your weapon out and pass it back to me.

252
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,015
慢点
Slowly.

253
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,050
开车
Start the car and drive.

254
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:02,073
你看见我对帕维尔做了什么了
You saw what I did to Pavel.

255
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,017
我没有太多时间和他纠缠
I didn't have a lot of time with him.

256
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,060
至于你  我有的是时间
You, I've got all the time in the world.

257
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,051
所以你要么照我说的做  要么我将你大卸八块
So you either do what I say, or I will take you apart piece by piece.

258
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,098
开车
Now, drive!

259
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:20,089
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

260
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,003
联合国总部
The U.N.

261
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,041
为什么去那  你已经得到你想要的了
Why? You already got what you wanted.

262
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,090
你杀了所有有牵连的人
You killed everyone involved.

263
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,001
别废话了
Save your breath.

264
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:33,042
我知道萨瓦洛夫总统也参与了
I know about President Suvarov.

265
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:48,000
您的代表团会在签署仪式结束后
Your delegations will be joining you at the reception

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,025
在招待会与您回合
after the post-signing ceremony.

267
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,063
最后  我谨代表联合国工作人员
And finally, on behalf of the U.N. Staff,

268
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:56,007
想说的是  能见证这一历史时刻
I would like to say that we are all honored

269
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,084
我们所有成员都感到非常荣幸
to be part of this historic occasion.

270
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:01,001
感谢各位的聆听
Thank you for your time.

271
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,099
您的女儿一直在外面等着  有事要对您说
Your daughter's been waiting outside to speak to you.

272
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,011
她说事关重大
She says it's important.

273
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,070
-告诉她我马上去找她  -是  阁下
- Let her know I'll be right there. - Yes, ma'am.

274
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:24,020
总统阁下
Madam President.

275
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,034
我有东西要给您
I have something for you.

276
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,091
是奥马赠送的
It's from Omar.

277
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:34,034
他原本打算在签署协议的时候给您用的
He wanted to give it to you to sign the agreement, and...

278
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:40,022
有幸我能代表他转交给您
I'm grateful that I can do so on his behalf.

279
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,029
上面写道  "所有的宗教信仰
It reads "All religions,

280
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:47,080
"一切的歌颂
"All this singing,

281
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,086
"皆为一愿
"One song,

282
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,096
愿真主[和平]与您同在" [双关语]
peace be with you."

283
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,010
当奥马谈到你们共同为之奋斗的事业时
It is a verse Omar would quote from Rumi

284
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:02,097
他总会引用鲁米的这首诗
when he was talking about what you and he were trying to achieve.

285
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,021
感谢您同我们一起共度难关
Thank you for seeing this through

286
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:09,064
并感谢您帮助我们重新认识了哈桑
and for helping us all do justice to his memory.

287
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,059
达莉亚  我...
Dalia, I am...

288
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:22,013
这是我的荣幸
I am honored.

289
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,013
我倍感荣幸
I'm very honored.

290
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,089
凯拉  怎么了
Kayla, what is it?

291
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:51,039
梅瑞狄斯·里德打过电话到您的住所找您
Meredith Reed called the residence looking for you.

292
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,066
我不想听那女人所谓的慰问
I am not interested in that woman's condolences.

293
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:55,029
她不是为这个打电话来的
That is not why she called.

294
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,016
她说她有杀害父亲幕后凶手的情报
She says she has information about the people who are behind father's murder.

295
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,073
但我们都知道谁是幕后凶手了
But we know who was behind your father's death--

296
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,047
是我们国家的极端主义分子
extremists in our country.

297
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:06,087
她声称他们有外国势力协助
She claims that they had outside help.

298
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:08,071
是俄罗斯人
That the Russians were involved.

299
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,054
她为什么会说这些
Why would she say such a thing?

300
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:12,046
她有证据吗  还是只是谣言
Does she have evidence, or is this just a rumor?

301
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:15,098
我不知道  但她也不会草率打电话给您的
I don't know, but it can't have been easy for her to call you.

302
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,065
我认为她不会因为一个谣言就来告诉我们
I don't think she would have done so because of a rumor.

303
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,048
她还说了什么
What else did she say?

304
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:23,029
在和您讲上话之前  她不愿再透露更多
She wouldn't say anything more until she talked to you.

305
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,052
她留了她的电话号码
She left her number.

306
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:31,016
我们回住所给她打电话
Let's call her from the residence.

307
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,041
安  萨瓦洛夫总统的车队因为路线改变
Ann, President Suvarov's motorcade is delayed

308
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,056
要晚五分钟  把这通知所有机构
five minutes because of the new route-- put out an all-agency.

309
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,008
机密等级如何设置
How do you want it coded?

310
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:51,025
绝密
Eyes only.

311
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,025
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,012
兰扎  确保伯克到这里报告的时候
Lanza, make sure Burke reports here

313
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,086
给奥迪斯探员带套战术装备
with a set of tactical gear for Agent Ortiz.

314
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,045
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,036
阿洛正在反恐组用面部识别软件
Arlo's at CTU, running the surveillance video

316
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:04,061
扫描监控录像
through facial recognition software.

317
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:07,023
-还是没有发现杰克  -我一直在想
- Still no sign of Jack. - Look, I've been thinking.

318
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,097
假如我们确实从杰克那里拿到了这个录音
Let's say we do get this recording from Jack.

319
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:10,027
我们要怎么处理它
What are we supposed to do with it?

320
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,000
我是说  总统既然决心扣押梅瑞狄斯...
I mean, if the president's willing to lock down Meredith Reed...

321
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,014
但她无法封上全球所有媒体的嘴
She can't shut down every media outlet in the world,

322
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:16,097
这意味着我们能把证据传出去
which is where we're gonna send this file.

323
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:19,098
我们还要把证据发给国内所有政府部门的公务员
We're also gonna send it to every government employee in the country.

324
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,049
包括立法机构  军方  以及司法部
Legislative, military, judiciary--

325
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,008
那就是十万多人
that's over a hundred thousand people.

326
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,035
我们怎么才能做到
How are we doing this?

327
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,062
通过反恐组的服务器
By using CTU servers,

328
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:27,098
我们能够把证据同时发给所有人
we can distribute it simultaneously to everyone.

329
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,054
真相终会大白  就算是泰勒总统也拦不住
President Taylor won't be able to stop the truth from getting out.

330
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,012
伯克
Burke.

331
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,059
-很高兴见到你  -长官
- Good to see you. - Sir.

332
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,088
你用了萨瓦洛夫总统到达路线的修改方案吗
Did you use the revised protocol for President Suvarov's arrival?

333
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,050
是的  长官
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,070
我们正让车队行驶到罗斯福大道的匝道上去
We're now bringing the motorcade into the FDR Drive ramp.

335
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,025
很好
Good.

336
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,064
确保奥迪斯探员拿到车队路线的修改方案
Make sure that Agent Ortiz has the revised protocols.

337
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:44,010
他已恢复外勤指挥权
He's back in charge.

338
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,025
去看看情况吧
Let's take a look.

339
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,077
我们要开到哈特大厦
We're going to the Hart Building.

340
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,074
我要你把车停到地下停车场
I want you to park underground.

341
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,041
这个守卫的命掌握在你手里
This guard's life is in your hands.

342
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,089
你敢乱来  我就杀了你们两个  明白吗
You make one move that I don't like, I'm gonna kill you both, you understand?

343
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,053
杰森·皮勒
Jason Pillar.

344
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:55,068
里面没人
There's no one inside.

345
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,061
他们在两小时前离开了大厦
They left the building two hours ago.

346
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,068
我只是进行最后的安检工作
Yeah, I'm just running a last-minute security check.

347
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,021
遵命  长官
Of course, sir.

348
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:08,059
还有什么问题吗  长官
Is there anything else, sir?

349
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,044
没有  谢谢
No. Thank you.

350
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,010
开车
Drive.

351
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:32,058
就在这停车
Pull in over here.

352
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:41,012
慢慢地  用你的右手
Slowly, with your right hand,

353
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:43,002
把车钥匙拔出来
take the keys out of the ignition

354
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:44,015
然后递给我
and pass them back.

355
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,069
下车
Get out of the car.

356
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,045
快点
Now!

357
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,084
关门
Close the door.

358
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:59,047
把手放在车顶上
Put your hands on the roof.

359
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,005
不许动
Don't you move.

360
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:06,058
萨瓦洛夫要再过一小时才会出现在演讲台上
Suvarov's not gonna be out on the podium for another hour.

361
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:07,074
按你流血的速度
You're not gonna make it that long,

362
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,081
你撑不到那个时候
not the way you're bleeding.

363
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,065
慢慢地
Slowly,

364
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:17,079
背着走向我
back up towards me.

365
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,050
停下  转过来
Stop. Turn around.

366
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,033
好
Good.

367
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,003
你帮我缝合伤口
You're gonna suture me up.

368
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:38,098
你要敢对我乱来
You try and make a move on me,

369
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,058
哪怕是很小的动作
the slightest twitch,

370
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:42,078
我就一枪崩了你
I will put a bullet in your brain.

371
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,095
你明白吗
You got it?

372
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,058
明白
Yes.

373
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,090
我有点不明白
I don't understand something.

374
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:04,053
你的整个职业生涯都在干着出格的事
You've spent your entire career working outside the system;

375
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,057
而你总有一个合理的原因
you've always had a good reason.

376
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:10,014
但这次...  纯粹是白白流血
But this... it's just blood lost.

377
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,084
你这是在葬送一个耗费了数年才得以实现的协议
You're destroying an agreement that took years to put together.

378
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:15,081
一个由凶手和骗子达成的协议吗
An agreement made by murderers and liars.

379
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,055
凶手
Murderers?

380
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,026
你才是杀人不眨眼的凶手吧
You're the one killing people in cold blood.

381
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:23,075
我杀的每个人都参与了今天的袭击
Everybody I took out had a hand in today's attack.

382
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:26,002
但是谁给你权力充当法官和陪审团
But who makes you judge and jury?

383
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,062
是泰勒总统
President Taylor,

384
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:29,089
就是当她同意掩盖真相的时候
when she agreed to the cover-up.

385
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,066
我本愿意接受通过法律途径裁决...
I would have accepted justice by law...

386
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:37,033
但你们这些人剥夺了我的这一正当途径
but that was taken away from me by people like you.

387
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,091
所以你说得对  我就是法官和陪审团
So you're right-- I am judge and jury.

388
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:42,089
现在  给我退后
Now, step back.

389
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,089
往车那边走
Start to move back towards the car.

390
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,004
我是在哈桑和蕾妮被杀后才参与进来的
Look, I came in after Hassan and Renee were killed.

391
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:52,077
这一切与我无关  你得相信我
I didn't have anything to do with that, you have to believe me.

392
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,037
给我跪下
Get on your knees!

393
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,090
求你了  鲍尔  我说的是实话
Please, Bauer, I'm telling you the truth.

394
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:56,094
我有个家  还有个女儿
I've got a family; I've got a little girl.

395
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,052
鲍尔  求你了...
Bauer, please...

396
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,096
求求你  别杀我  
Please, don't kill me.

397
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,096
求你  求你了
Please. Please.

398
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:57,004
还是没人接
Still no answer.

399
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:59,008
你确定这是梅瑞狄斯·里德的号码吗
Are you sure this is Meredith Reed's number?

400
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,050
-她给我留的就这号  -那她为什么不接
- It's the number she gave me. - Then why isn't she answering?

401
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,077
我刚和盖里·克劳斯纳谈过了  
I just spoked to Gary Klausner,

402
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,028
他是里德女士的编辑
Ms. Reed's editor.

403
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:07,042
他也不知道她的下落  也无法与她取得联系
He doesn't know where she is and has no way to reach her.

404
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,086
不过他好像急着挂电话
He seemed very anxious to get off the phone.

405
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,030
您要去哪
Where are you going?

406
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,088
泰勒总统和我将在不到一小时内
President Taylor and I are supposed to be sitting across the table

407
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:22,077
与尤里·萨瓦洛夫坐下会面了
from Yuri Suvarov in less than an hour.

408
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:25,006
如果他的政府与你父亲的死有关
If his government was involved in murdering your father,

409
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,066
那泰勒总统必须得知道
President Taylor needs to know.

410
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,045
伴随奥马·哈桑的死
Following the death of Omar Hassan,

411
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:37,092
据传萨瓦洛夫总统曾一度对和谈
President Suvarov was reportedly pessimistic

412
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,029
能否继续持悲观态度
about the viability of the peace treaty.

413
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,032
但关于俄罗斯方面要退出和谈的谣言
But rumors of a Russian withdrawal

414
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:44,054
很快就被白宫方面澄清

00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:47,040
萨瓦洛夫总统将即刻抵达联合国总部
and President Suvarov is expected to arrive at the U.N. Shortly.

416
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,074
请进

417
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,067
请恕打扰  总统阁下
Excuse me, Madam President.

418
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,031
是达莉亚·哈桑
It's Dalia Hassan.

419
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:54,011
我会给她回电的
I'll have to call her back.

420
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,061
她就在外面  总统阁下
She's outside, ma'am.

421
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,078
她说事情很紧急
She says it's urgent.

422
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,048
让她进来
Send her in.

423
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,067
总统阁下  请原谅
Madam President, forgive me.

424
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:24,057
我刚听到了让我非常不安的消息
I have just heard something that is very disturbing.

425
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,094
您听到了什么
What did you hear?

00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,006
俄罗斯政府
That the Russian government,

427
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,007
或者说是俄罗斯政府内部的人
or people within the Russian government,

00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:32,015
与我丈夫的死有关
were involved in the murder of my husband.

429
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,005
您从哪听到的
Where did you hear this?

430
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,078
我女儿接到了一个电话
My daughter received a phone call

431
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,098
来自梅瑞狄斯·里德  就是那个记者
from the journalist, Meredith Reed.

432
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:41,075
您亲自和她谈过吗
Have you spoken with her yourself?

433
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:42,034
没有
No.

434
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:44,027
我试过了一切方法
I've tried everything,

435
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,069
但还是无法与她取得联系
but I've been unable to reach her.

436
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:50,061
我来这是寻求您的帮助  帮我找寻里德小姐
I came here to ask for your help finding Miss Reed.

437
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:55,019
我要知道她所说的是否属实
I need to know if there is any truth in what she said.

438
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:57,030
达莉亚  我们也听到过
Dalia, we heard a rumor

439
00:24:57,036 --> 00:25:00,007
关于俄罗斯牵涉其中的一个谣言
about the Russians being involved as well.

440
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:02,074
而您却没有告诉我
And you didn't tell me?

441
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,041
没有  因为我们调查过了
No. Because we looked into it

442
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,049
发现这纯属谣言
and found that there was nothing backing it up.

443
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,062
只是个轻率的指控罢了
It was just a frivolous accusation.

444
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:10,097
且不说她其他方面的是非
Whatever else she may be,

445
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,043
梅瑞狄斯·里德可不是个轻率的人
Meredith Reed is not a frivolous woman.

446
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:14,093
她来找我
She came to me,

447
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:19,002
明知道我完全有理由来质疑她
someone she knew would have every reason to doubt her.

448
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:20,067
达莉亚
Dalia...

449
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,086
我知道你需要答案
I know that you want answers...

450
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:26,087
但再过不到一小时  我们就要签署和平协议了
but we are signing the agreement in less than an hour.

451
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:30,031
总统阁下  我想我说得不够清楚
Madam President, I feel like you're not listening to me.

452
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:34,052
在我和这个可能是我杀夫凶手的人签署协议前
Before I sign a treaty with people who may have murdered my husband,

453
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,099
必须得帮我找到这个女人
I need help finding this woman.

454
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:39,023
拜托了
Please.

455
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,011
我会在我们剩余的时间内尽全力去找的
I will do the best I can in the time that we have left.

456
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:45,027
我想我说得还不够清楚
I don't think I'm making myself clear.

457
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:48,034
在我没弄清她所言是否属实之前
Until I determine if her allegations are true,

458
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,028
我是不会签署这份协议的
I will not sign this treaty.

459
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,023
达莉亚
Dalia...

460
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,055
拜托  别意气用事
please, be reasonable.

461
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,032
这就是我的立场  总统阁下
This is my position, Madam President.

462
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,099
我意已决
I will not change my mind.

463
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:06,005
那么你...  让我没得选择
Then you... You leave me no choice.

464
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,097
是我下令逮捕了梅瑞狄斯·里德
I had Meredith Reed arrested.

465
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,046
为什么
Why?

466
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:20,023
因为她所说的话破坏性太强了
Because her allegations would be too damaging.

467
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:21,070
这也说不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

468
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:25,067
就算她所言非实  您也不会逮捕她吧
You wouldn't arrest someone for making false allegations.

469
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:30,084
除非她说的是真的
Unless they aren't false.

470
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:36,028
你早就知道了
You knew!

471
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:40,083
你早就知道俄罗斯政府是杀我丈夫的幕后黑手
You knew the Russians were behind my husband's death,

472
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,035
而你却缄口不言
and you said nothing?!

473
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,019
达莉亚
Dalia,

474
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,002
我非常抱歉
I am so sorry.

475
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:51,099
当时的处境根本让我没得选择
It-it was an im-impossible situation.

476
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,036
我是在设法保护你
I was trying to protect you.

477
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,077
保护我
Protect me?

478
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,000
你背叛了我
You betrayed me!

479
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,080
达莉亚  我们即将完成数代人的心血
Dalia, we are about to complete the most important

480
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,065
实现举世瞩目的外交壮举
diplomatic action in generations.

481
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:08,092
您丈夫为了保住这一协议牺牲了自己的生命...
Your husband sacrificed his life to preserve this treaty...

482
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,059
你还有脸提起我丈夫
How dare you invoke my husband!

483
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:12,079
他还活着的话  绝无可能容忍此事
He never would have stood for this!

484
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,044
之所以有这个协议是因为他信任你
This treaty happened because he trusted you.

485
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:24,071
即便是当时我迫切地想回家哀悼他
And even though every fiber in my being wanted to go home and grieve,

486
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,029
我还是选择继续  因为我信任你
I carried on because I trusted you.

487
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,065
但我再也不会信任你了
But not anymore.

488
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:30,078
我是绝对不会
I will not make peace

489
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:34,040
与谋杀我丈夫的人和谈  包括你
with the people who murdered my husband. Or with you.

490
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:36,056
不会再有什么和平协议
There will be no agreement.

491
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:43,042
我会向联合国提交一份正式的控诉
I will be entering a formal complaint with the United Nations,

492
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:45,043
要求你释放里德女士
demanding that you release Ms. Reed,

493
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:48,022
并公开一切你隐瞒我
and disclose whatever evidence you've kept from me

494
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:50,049
和世人的证据
and from the rest of the world!

495
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,090
站住
Stop!

496
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:05,016
一小时内  你会和我并肩出现在会议中心
In one hour, you will stand beside me in the council chamber,

497
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:08,044
你将签署你丈夫之前与我达成的和平协议
and you will sign the treaty your husband and I agreed to.

498
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:10,049
-做梦  -你会签的
- I will not! - You will!

499
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:13,072
因为如果你不签
Because if you don't,

500
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:17,089
我方政府将公开确凿而有力的证据
my administration will disclose hard, indisputable evidence

501
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:20,090
贵国情报部门的间谍
that agents inside your intelligence service

502
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:24,048
企图在我国领土引爆核弹
attempted to detonate a nuclear device on our soil,

503
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,088
这让我有一切所需的正当理由
which will give me all the justification I need

504
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,058
对伊斯兰共和国进行报复性打击
to retaliate against the IRK

505
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,071
打击将倾注美军全部军力
with the full force of the American military.

506
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:37,025
这将让贵国在数十年内无法恢复
It will be decades before your country recovers.

507
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,037
不过我们不必非要走到那一步
But it doesn't need to come to that.

508
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,035
你只需签署协议
All you have to do is sign the agreement.

509
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,013
达莉亚
Dalia?!

510
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,075
先是我丈夫遇刺身亡
First they murder my husband,

511
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:19,047
现在这个欺骗了我的女人又来威胁我的国家
and now this woman who has lied to me is threatening my country!

512
00:31:25,064 --> 00:31:28,005
我现在一筹莫展  总统阁下
I don't see a way out of this, Madam President.

513
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:34,010
我们可以向全世界揭露这些俄罗斯杂种干的好事
We can tell the world what these Russian bastards did,

514
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,068
而泰勒总统又是怎样护着他们的
and how President Taylor protected them.

515
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,086
我们可以直接上诉海牙国际法庭
We can take our case directly to The Hague.

516
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:39,088
罪名根本不成立
There is no case.

517
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:43,001
我们的任何一项指控都没有证据支持
No proof to support any of these accusations.

518
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:44,023
更重要的是
More important,

519
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:46,013
还要考虑泰勒总统对我国的威胁
there are President Taylor's threats to consider.

520
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,050
我们不能忽略这些因素
We cannot dismiss them.

521
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,079
我们的军队能保护我们不受侵犯
Our military can protect us from incursion.

522
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:53,051
如有必要  我们可以重启核子计划
And if necessary, we can reactivate our nuclear program!

523
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,071
这正中您丈夫敌人的下怀
Giving your husband's enemies exactly what they wanted in the first place.

524
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,075
也给了她更充足的借口
In addition to providing her with even more of an excuse

525
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:06,005
先行对我国发动军事打击
to launch a preemptive military strike against us.

526
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:09,049
我才不管泰勒说过什么  她没那胆子
I don't care what President Taylor said; she wouldn't dare.

527
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:13,044
您真的能冒那个险吗
Can you really take that chance?

528
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:24,057
请讲
Yes?

529
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:28,098
谢谢
Thank you.

530
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:36,077
尤里·萨瓦洛夫的代表团随时都会达到
Yuri Suvarov's delegation will be arriving any moment.

531
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,074
泰勒总统希望您去迎接他
President Taylor is expecting you there to greet him.

532
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,029
奥迪斯探员
Agent Ortiz?

533
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:01,083
我刚和阿洛通过话
I just spoke with Arlo.

534
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,090
他刚获得了杰克的脸部识别匹配图
He got a facial recognition hit on Jack.

535
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,003
在哪里
Where?

536
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,053
就在我们的警戒范围内
Inside our perimeter.

537
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,032
他就在这里  科尔
He's here, Cole.

538
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:13,019
他很谨慎  躲过了所有监控探头
He's been careful to avoid all the security cameras,

539
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,079
不过阿洛发现了这个
but Arlo found this.

540
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:18,029
是从联合国街对面的哈特大厦第22层拍到的
It's from the 22nd floor of the Hart Building across the street from the U.N.

541
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,030
软件系统识别出了他在玻璃中的样子
The software picked up his reflection.

542
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,016
他怎么进到大厦里去的
How did he get into the building?

543
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,077
根据记录  过去二十分钟内
According to the logs, the only person that entered the building

544
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:26,097
唯一进入那栋大厦的是皮勒
within the past 20 minutes was Pillar.

545
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:28,071
杰克一定已挟持了他
Jack must have taken him hostage.

546
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,003
透过大厦东边的窗户
The windows on the east side of the building

547
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:32,020
让他能清楚地看到演讲台
give him a clean line of sight down onto the podium.

548
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,072
我去找他
I'm going to go find him.

549
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,092
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

550
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,029
不行
You can't.

551
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,019
这样只会燃起"战火"
It would just cause a fight.

552
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,077
杰克只愿意听我的劝
I'm the only one that Jack will listen to.

553
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:40,094
如果他不听你的呢
And what if he doesn't?

554
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,031
给我二十分钟
Give me 20 minutes.

555
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,051
如果还没有我的消息
If you don't hear from me,

556
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:47,060
我们就按原计划进行
we'll follow through with our plan.

557
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,069
启动对杰克的警报  并保护萨瓦洛夫
Sound the alarm about Jack and secure Suvarov.

558
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:53,053
就二十分钟
20 minutes.

559
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:55,048
-好  -别关掉通讯器
- Okay. - And keep your comm open.

560
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,043
-我要掌握一切动态  -不行
- I want to know what's going on. - I can't.

561
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,017
反恐组正监控所有频率
CTU is monitoring all frequencies.

562
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,022
这样太冒险了
It's too risky.

563
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,074
好吧
All right.

564
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:05,065
那最起码带上这个
At least take this.

565
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,013
-谢谢  -要多加小心
- Thanks. - Be careful.

566
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:17,076
奥布赖恩去哪了
Where's O'Brian headed?

567
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,024
她要再最后清查一下警戒区
She's running a last-minute perimeter sweep.

568
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,003
她一个人干吗
By herself?

569
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:24,044
保持与萨瓦洛夫的保镖实时通讯和图像传输畅通
Keep a real-time uplink open with Suvarov's security people.

570
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:25,065
一切开始运作了就通知我
Let me know when it's up and running.

571
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:27,088
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

572
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:37,064
好
Okay.

573
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,093
就我所记得的
As long as I can remember,

574
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,041
过去每次我不得已和你谈话
every time I've had to talk to you,

575
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,086
似乎总是因各种原因
it seems, for one reason or another,

576
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:54,021
我总先以抱歉作为开场白
I've started out by telling you how sorry I am.

577
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:57,056
但今天我不会对你那么说了
I'm not going to do that to you now.

578
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:02,008
你将听到关于我今天行为的各种版本的说法
You're going to hear a lot of stories about what I've done today.

579
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,065
有些可能是事实
Some of them may even be true.

580
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:05,050
可没有人  我是说除我之外
But no one, and I mean no one

581
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:08,083
没人能告诉你  我为何那么干的原因
can tell you why I did what I did except for me.

582
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,053
今天很多好人丧生了
And a lot of good people died today.

583
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,068
不止是哈桑总统
Not just President Hassan.

584
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:19,015
反恐组的探员们  其他执法机构的工作人员们
Operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies.

585
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:24,020
还有蕾妮·沃克
Renee Walker.

586
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:28,080
她和我关系非常亲密
Who I was very close to.

587
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:44,037
请讲
Yes?

588
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:46,015
谢谢
Thank you.

589
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:51,000
萨瓦洛夫总统的车队快到了

你以为我会相信你吗
