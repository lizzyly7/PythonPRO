我没有转账
I didn't transfer the funds.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,086
没给他酬劳  他为什么还对霍奇斯下手呢
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?!

7
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:33,033
这正合你意啊  对吧
Because it's what you wanted, am I right?

杰克  我破解了托尼的定位数据

你不告诉我  我不会停手

把这条线连到你耳机上  让它一直开着

我要监听你说的每句话

你得帮助托尼·阿尔梅达脱身
You will help Tony Almeida escape

25
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,060
不然我的人会杀了你女儿

保护泰勒女士
Strict protocols be followed for Ms. Taylor's protection.

42
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,050
我为什么需要保护
Why would I need protecting?

43
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,060
用词不准确
A poor choice of words.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,043
只是这样  对你的询问仅是例行公事
I merely meant that, uh, your questioning is just a formality.

45
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:23,053
我们得对所有知道霍奇斯出事前行踪的人
We have to go through everyone who had knowledge of

46
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,096
进行调查

47
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,000
明白了

我让奥利维亚来参加这次通报会

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,076
-她在哪里  -抱歉  女士

52
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,043
她正跟司法部副部长在一起

接受霍奇斯谋杀一案的调查

54
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,016
他们查到谁泄露了霍奇斯所在地点了吗

55
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,033
还没有
Not yet.

56
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,000
但他们认为知道霍奇斯还活着
But they agree that the list of people

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,056
待在调查局的人很少
Who knew Hodges was alive and at FBI is short.

58
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,016
泄密人应该是内部人员
The leak had to come from inside.

59
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,053
早上好  各位
Good morning, everyone.

60
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,053
早上好  总统阁下
Morning, madam president.

61
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:02,020

请坐
Please take your seats.

63
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,086
我知道大家都很困顿
I realize that we are all in dire need of sleep.

64
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:12,050
但让各位及时了解
But I felt that it was vital to bring you all up to speed

65
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,056
过去几小时发生的事情

66
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:18,010
以及即将发生更大的危机  刻不容缓

67
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,063
不到30分钟前  调查局成功找到

68
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:24,060
最后一罐生化武器
The last canister of the bioweapon.

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,090
但恐怕危险还未解除
But I'm afraid that the danger is far from over.

70
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,013
在乔纳斯·霍奇斯被杀前  他说
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us

71
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:34,056
还有其他势力也参与了

72
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,023

75
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:45,020
勾结起来破坏我们国家的政府
Collaborating to undermine the government of this country.

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,063
不好意思  总统阁下
Excuse me, madam president.

77
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:48,033
我们说的是哪些军工企业
But which military firms are we talking about?

78
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,000
我们不知道  上将
We don't know, admiral.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,033
霍奇斯没有透露这些公司
Hodges gave us no names or idea

80
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,056
的名字或其他信息
Of which companies are involved.

81
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,080
但不管他们是谁
But whoever they are,

82
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,010
他们都是实实在在的威胁
They represent a very real and ongoing threat.

83
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:06,093
目前我们没有可靠情报
Now, we don't have much actionable intelligence at this point.

84
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:10,060
联邦调查局已经拘押了前反恐组成员
However, the FBI has apprehended former CTU operative

85
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,063
托尼·阿尔梅达

86
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,080
他是这次阴谋的关键人物
He is a key figure in this plot,

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,003
我们希望能通过他
And someone we hope will be able to help us

88
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,046
找到这些人
Uncover who these people are.

89
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,043
沃克探员  我是布拉沃三号空援组
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo Three.

90
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,030
我们已就位  你们的护卫队在视线范围

91
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,066
收到  布拉沃三号

在市区建立安全通道

00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,020
我们会带托尼·阿尔梅达
We'll be bringing Almeida into headquarters

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,026
从西大门进入总部
Through the west entrance.

96
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,020
鲍尔先生  是时候了
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer.

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,000
跟你一起的护卫队快下I-70洲际公路了
The convoy you're traveling with is about to get off on the I-70.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,030
在进入市区前你必须得行动
You need to break off before you reach the downtown exit

99
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,056
否则就没那么容易帮托尼逃走了
Or you'll lose your chance to facilitate an escape for Tony.

100
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,070
为了你女儿好
For your daughter's sake,

101
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,003
你不想这样的
You don't want that to happen.

102
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,096
现在好好给我听着
Now listen carefully.

103
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,076
你得控制这辆车
You'll need to commandeer the van

00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:58,090
开到约四英里外的塔夫特大街路口
And peel onto the taft street exit in about four miles.

105
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,040
到了后我再说怎么做
I'll direct you further once you've managed that.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,023
记住  我手下的人正看着你女儿
Remember, my operatives are with your daughter.

107
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,066
事实上  她的一举一动我都清楚
In fact, I'm looking at her right now.

108
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,046
别想逞英雄
So don't try to be a hero.

109
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,043
怎么了
Something wrong?

110

感觉飞机要满员了
It's just starting to look like the flight is gonna be full,

111

我只能做下一班

112
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,026
不不  你肯定能登机的
No, no, you're gonna get on.

113
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:34,023
昨天飞机差点相撞的事情
I mean, there have to be some people that are too spooked

114
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,083
肯定有人心有余悸不敢来了
To fly after those planes went down yesterday.

115
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,086
鲍勃
Bob.

116
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,020
提那事干嘛
Did you have to bring that up?

117
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,083
就是说说
I'm just saying.

118
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,010
他们做了预防措施
Look, I think it makes us safer.

119
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,020
会让我们更安心
They're gonna take extra precautions.

120
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
打扰一下
Excuse me.

121
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,086
这些是你的行李吗
Are those yours?

122
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,036
是的
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:51,066
能麻烦挪一下吗  为我妈妈腾个地方
Would you mind, so my mother could sit down, please?

124
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,060
当然
Oh, sure.

125
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,043
谢谢
Thanks.

126
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,093
你流血了
Oh, you're bleeding.

127
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,050
什么
What?

128
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,086
你脖子上有一个抓伤
You have a scratch on your neck.

129
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,043
亲爱的
Honey.

130
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,063
是不是你下出租时
Oh, that must have happened

131
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:08,080
碰到了门呀
When the door hit you getting out of the cab.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,073
哦
Oh, well, I'll just, uh,

133
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:12,036
我去报刊亭那边

134
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,013
看看有没有创可贴卖
And see if they have some band-aids.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,096
怎么了
What is it?

136
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:41,000
我有点担心
I'm getting worried.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,046
早晚特勤局探员尸体
It's only a matter of time before

138
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:44,030
会被发现
That FBI agent's body is discovered.

139
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,050
鲍尔的女儿好像在怀疑了
And I think Bauer's daughter is getting suspicious.

140
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,080
我给鲍尔限定的时间交出托尼
Look, I gave Bauer a short window to deliver Tony to me.

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
不会很久的
Won't be long.

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,066
好了我会通知你
Just stand by until you hear from me.

143
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,066
如果鲍尔的女儿在那之前发现我们了呢
And what if kim bauer makes us before then?

144
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:57,043
你不能冒险被抓
You can't allow yourselves to be taken.

145
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,080
你知道怎么做的
Do what you have to do.

146
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,033
沃克探员  看一下你的耳机
Agent walker, let me see your comm unit.

147
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,073
我要调试一下频率
I want to adjust this frequency.

00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,093

我按你的要求派弗兰克探员保护她

我们不需要人质  尤其是他

把他毙了  我们远走高飞

227
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,020
卡拉  你真是没有远见
You're not seeing the big picture, Cara.

228
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,053
你们组织将能发射生化武器

就和原计划一样

我们已经丢了毒气罐

232

病原体已经不在我们手中
We don't have the pathogen anymore.

233
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,023
我们有杰克就够
We have Jack.

234
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:26,013
病原体在他的血液里
The pathogen's in his blood,

235
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,016
就在他的器官里
It's in his organs.

236
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:31,070
我们可以从他体内摄取所有病原体
We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body.

237
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,036
你以为我让你派人马去盯着金·鲍尔干什么
Why do you think I had you put those operatives on Kim Bauer?

238
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:38,016
你们组织 仍需要证明杰克是活菌体
Your people are still going to need proof that Jack's viable.

239
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:41,083
派个生物学家在军事基地等我们
Have one of your biochemists meet us at the complex.

240
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,013
再次感谢你能赶来
Thank you again for coming.

241
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,056
皮尔斯探员
You can thank me, Agent Pierce,

242
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:12,036
你可以对我和盘托出  以表达对我的感激
By telling me what this is all about.

243
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,036
好  可是我们时间紧迫
All right, sir, but we don't have much time.

244
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:16,093
你暗示说这件事关系到奥利维亚·泰勒
You implied it had something to do with Olivia Taylor.

245
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,096
没错
Yes, sir.

246
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:19,063
几小时前
A few hours ago,

247
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:22,063
乔纳斯·霍奇斯在联调局总部外遇害
Jonas Hodges was killed outside FBI headquarters.

248
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,020
老天爷
My god.

249
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,000
当局相信他被害是因为
Now, authorities believe he was murdered to keep him

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,033
有人杀人灭口
From implicating others

251
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,033
以此保住牵扯进生化武器人物的秘密
Who were involved in the bioweapon attacks,

252
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,090
可我怀疑可能另有隐情
But I suspect there may be another scenario.

253
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,033
我有理由相信泰勒小姐
And I have reason to believe that Ms. Taylor

254
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,080
可能涉案
Might be involved.

255
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,020
真是骇人听闻的指控啊  皮尔斯探员
That is an outrageous accusation, Agent Pierce.

256
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,066
奥利维亚的确神通广大
Olivia is capable of many things,

257
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,030
-可我不相信她会杀人  -卡宁先生
- But I can't believe committing murder is one of them.- mr. kanin

258
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,096
请你听我把话说完
Please, just hear me out.

259
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,000
总统同意将霍奇斯
After the president agreed

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,003
列入证人保护计划后
To a witness protection deal for Hodges,

261
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:58,056
泰勒小姐对我说  她想要霍奇斯的命
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me about wanting to see Hodges dead.

262
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,083
是他害死了她弟弟
He was responsible for her brother's death.

263
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,086
她只是在泄愤而已
She was venting.

264
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,026
我也本这么以为
I thought so, too.

265
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:06,043
可后来她在办公室接见了一位老同事
Until she met in her office with an old colleague of hers,

266
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:08,010
名叫马丁·柯里尔
A man named Martin Collier.

267
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,066
我认识柯里尔
I know Collier.

268
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,053
那你应该知道他的作风
Then you know the sort of man he is.

269
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,086
对
I do.

270
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:15,023
可这也不能证明他们是共谋
But none of this constitutes proof of complicity.

271
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,076
对  先生  因此我需要您
No, sir. that's why I need you

272
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:18,066
登陆数字录音系统
To access the digital recording system.

273
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:21,066
看他们的谈话是否被录音
To see if their conversation was recorded.

274
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,003
你在唆使我闯入一间办公室
Agent, you're asking me to break into an office

275
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,020
而它已经不属于我
That's no longer mine.

276
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,050
然后进入代理联席幕僚长的分类录音系统
And access classified recordings of the acting chief of staff.

277
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,086
卡宁先生  如果我的怀疑没错
Mr. Kanin, if my suspicions prove correct,

278
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,006
你就会明白
You of all people understand

279
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,010
后果将不堪设想
How grave these consequences would be.

280
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,010
先生  泰勒小姐前几个小时的表现
Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior

281
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,090
反常至极
Over the past several hours has been erratic at best.

282
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,070
现在她正在接受司法部调查
Now she's with the justice department investigators now.

283
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,086
我们时间紧迫
We don't have much time.

284
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,036
先生  请你快决定是否愿意协助我调查
Sir, I need you to decide if you're going to help me.

285
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:27,030
泰勒小姐  您能否再回顾下
If you could just again review the records

286
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,030
屏幕下的这段记录
On the screen below, Ms. Taylor.

287
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,063
我想确认这段时间内
I want to confirm that during the timeline in question,

288
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,060
除了你上传给我们的这份
You had no outside contact other than

289
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,073
反映在电话记录和网页浏览记录的活动
What's reflected in the phone and internet logs

290
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,023
你没有和外界接触过
You uploaded to us.

291
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,073
第三次声明  情况属实
For the third time-- that's correct.

292
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:40,053
我们只是为确保调查彻底
We're just trying to be thorough, ma'am.

293
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,066
我们已经占用了你足够的宝贵时间
I think we've taken up enough of your valuable time,

294
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,096
泰勒小姐
Ms. Taylor.

她来了
She's on her way.

300
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,003
泰勒小姐
Ms. Taylor.

301
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,046
我之前想找您谈话
I tried to get word to you,

302
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,006
可他们告诉我您不方便
But was told you were not to be disturbed.

303
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,013
找我说什么
Word to me about what?

304
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,016
请听我解释
Let me explain.

Where is... yeah.

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
她叫泰莉
Her name's Teri.

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,086
她真可爱
She's adorable.

461
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,046
谢谢
Thank you.

462
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:26,026
那个是我的丈夫
That's my husband actually.

463
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,040
这个是
This is... ah...

464
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,046
干掉她
Take her.

465
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,040
不
No!

466
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,020
趴下  趴下
Get down! Get down!

467
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,040
都趴下
Everyone down!

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,083
二级警备  二级警备
Code two, code two!

469
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,013
疑犯持有武器
Suspects are armed!

470
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:54,020
趴下
Get down!

471
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,063
沃克
Walker.

472
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,033
我是金·鲍尔  保安都中枪了
It's Kim Bauer. Security's down.

473
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:42,046
-机场警察在哪里  -他们正赶去你那边
- Where are the airport police?! - They're mobilizing to you now.

474
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,060
那些雇佣兵怎么样了
What about the operatives?

475
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,050
那女的死了  男的正逃跑
The woman is dead. The man is getting away.

476
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,056
金  我们要通过他找到你父亲
Kim, we need him to find your father.

477
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,000
他朝那个方向走的
What direction is he headed?

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,023
沃克探员
Agent Walker?

479
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,096
见鬼
Damn it!

480
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:55,013
金  金
Kim? Kim?!

481
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,070
奥利维亚
Olivia.

482
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,046
我一直喜欢你这点  伊桑
I always liked that about you, Ethan.

483
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,003
就算是我小时候
Even when I was a little girl,

484
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,000
你也会在我进门时起立迎接
You always stood up when I came into the room.

485
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,026
恶习难改
Old habits die hard.

486
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,060
你从我的办公室带走了些东西
You removed something from my office.

487
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,000
我想要回来
I want it back.

488
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:38,030
我先前跟你说过  你随时可以拿回去
I told you before, you're welcome to them.

489
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,070
你非常清楚我不是在说那些文件
You know damn well I'm not talking about those files.

490
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,063
是吗
Do I?

491
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:46,060
伊桑  我发现那个电子录音机了
Ethan, I found the digital recorder.

492
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,033
现在把你拿走的还给我
Now give me what you took,

493
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,053
否则我会命令门外的安保警员
Or I'll order the security officers outside this door

494
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,023
对你进行光身检查
To strip search you.

495
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,090
好吧  我确实有录音
All right, I do have a recording.

496
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,050
不过是我过去在职那段时间的
It's a personal account of my last days

497
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,080
私人记录
In service to this administration

498
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,060
所以我觉得我有权拥有它
And I think I'm entitled to it.

499
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,050
没人有权利将敏感文件
No one is entitled to take sensitive material

500
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,006
带出白宫
Out of the White House.

501
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:13,073
那么你现在是在担心国家安全咯
Oh, now it's national security you're worried about?

502
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:17,006
事实上是的
As a matter of fact, yes.

503
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:20,046
我还保留着权限
Well, I still have my clearances.

504
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:22,066
为什么我们不在这里一起听这些录音呢
Why don't we listen to the recording together.

505
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:26,013
你现在没有职位来下达命令的  伊桑
You are in no position to dictate terms, Ethan.

506
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:28,083
你现在至少违反了10条联邦法条
You're in violation of at least ten federal laws.

507
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,096
你这么害怕的是什么  奥利维亚
What are you so afraid of, Olivia?

508
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:34,010
什么事有如此严重的指控
What's on there that's so incriminating?

509
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,006
我不是那个受到指控的人
I'm not the one facing incrimination.

510
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,050
你才是
You are.

511
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,043
但是如果你现在把录音交出来
But give me the recording right now

512
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,060
我会把那些指控都撤销
And I'll see to it that no charges are filed.

513
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,093
最后一次机会  伊桑
Last chance, Ethan.

514
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:02,053
在他身上找一个存储卡
Search him for a data card.

515
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:03,070
我被无故拘留
I'm being held without cause.

516
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,046
我要求和泰勒总统谈话
I demand to speak to president Taylor.

517
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,020
是总统阁下下达命令拘留你的
It was the president who ordered his detention.

518
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,033
如果是这样的话  我希望听她亲口说
If that's true, I want to hear it from her directly.

519
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,013
现在是犯罪事件
Well, this is a criminal matter now.

520
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:17,050
考虑到卡宁先生和总统阁下的私交
Considering her personal relationship

521
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,036
总统觉得介入调查
With Mr. Kanin, the president doesn't deem it appropriate

522
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,043
很不合适
To intrude on the investigation.

523
00:26:24,023 --> 00:26:28,020
请站起来  卡宁先生
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin.

524
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,046
胳臂抬起来
Arms up.

525
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,056
你将铸成大错
You're making a terrible mistake.

526
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:36,096
泰勒女士这是严重越权行事
Ms. Taylor is grossly overstepping her authority.

527
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,080
探员  谢谢你
Thank you, agent.

528
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,033
把他带走
Process him out.

529
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,080
卡宁先生  请跟我来
Come with me, Mr. Kanin.

530
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,023
你根本就不明白
I don't think you understand

531
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:01,096
你所作所为的严重性
The seriousness of what you're doing.

532
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:05,086
我可不认为你就明白
I don't think you do.

533
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:42,020
霍布森探员  剩下几步路我来吧
Agent Hobson, I can take him the rest of the way.

534
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,013
好的
Fine.

535
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,093
皮尔斯探员  她肯定隐瞒了什么
She's definitely hiding something, agent Pierce.

536
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:53,043
还好我早就猜到了
Lucky for us I'm a paranoid son of a bitch.

537
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:04,050
我能问一下另一张数据卡是什么吗
May I ask what was on the other data card?

538
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,040
什么都没有  是空白的
Nothing. It's blank.

539
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,060
我可以拿到通讯办公室的进入许可
Well, I can try to get you into the communications office

540
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,016
以便你听录音
So you can listen to that.

541
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:12,060
太冒险了  也没那个必要
Too risky, and unnecessary.

542
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,093
我车里就有一台录音机的播放设备
I have a companion device to the recorder in my car.

543
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:20,076
听起来像是你一直在  期待这件事发生
It sounds like you were... expecting this.

544
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:24,090
和奥利维亚打交道是需要未雨绸缪的
One has to be prepared when you're dealing with Olivia.

545
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,063
我一有发现就通知你
I'll let you know what I find.

546
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,050
你们要干什么
What are you doing?

547
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,026
你们要干什么
What are you doing?!

548
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,080
杰克  我们要利用你
We're gonna use you

549
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,010
来重新研制生化武器
To reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack.

550
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,056
脸朝下放在桌上
On the table facedown.

551
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,046
要花多长时间
How long till we know?

552
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,073
看情况吧
It depends.

553
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,026
什么情况
On what?

554
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,040
要根据他脊髓液里病原体的浓度来定
On the levels of pathogen in his spinal fluid.

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,080
给我一个大致时间
Give me a time frame.

556
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,063
15分钟
15 minutes.

557
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:54,033
好的  开始吧
Good. Get started.

558
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,066
托尼
Tony...

559
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,050
托尼
Tony!

560
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,076
-住手  -要先给他注射抗痉挛药物
- Don't! - Got to give him something to control the seizure.

561
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:01,086
让他一动不动的
I need him completely immobilized.

562
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:20,080
一知道鲍尔到底有没有用我会马上和组织联系
I'll contact the group as soon as we know if Bauer's viable.

563
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,026
没错  可我先要和你谈谈
Yeah, look, I need to talk to you first.

564
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,056
谈什么
What is it?

565
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,056
我想在组织里有更高的地位
I want a larger role in the organization.

566
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:29,040
而且我觉得现在是获得公认的最好时机
And I think this is a good time to make my case.

567
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,000
托尼  我们之前谈过的  是吧
Tony, we've gone over this before, okay?

568
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,010
这不合规定
It's not how it works.

569
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,026
你不能要求加入
You don't ask in.

570
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:34,043
只能是我们邀请你
You're invited in.

571
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:35,093
好吧  那帮我搞到一份邀请
All right, then get me an invitation.

572
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:37,093
听着  完成今天的任务后
Look, after what I've done today,

573
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,063
我认为那是我应得的
I think I've earned it.

574
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:43,076
你确实足智多谋
You have been resourceful, that's true.

575
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,010
但是
Still...

576
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,083
我知道你和上头直接联系
Look, I know you talk to the top guy.

577
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,003
我只是要你安排我们见一次面
All I'm asking is that you get us in the same room together.

578
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,026
我会毛遂自荐
I'll sell myself.

579
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:53,056
那不是个好方法
I don't think that would be the right approach.

580
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,043
-为什么不是  -因为他谨言慎行  托尼
- Why not? - Because he's careful to a fault, Tony.

581
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:58,026
而且他对他的匿名看的很重
And he's very protective of his anonymity.

582
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:00,056
我能理解
I can appreciate that.

583
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,083
但我也有底线
But the bottom line is,

584
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,096
没有我  就不会有这次行动
Without me, this operation never happens.

585
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:08,060
现在你能够影响他的决策
Now you have influence over him.

586
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,076
他相信你
He trusts you.

587
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,036
你可以说服他
You can convince him.

588
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,080
我以前见你做过
I've seen you do it before.

589
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,040
这次不同
This is different.

590
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,020
没错
That's right.

591
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,016
这次是不同
It is different.

592
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:21,096
这次是为了我
This time it's for me.

593
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,066
我准备好抽取脊髓液了
I'm ready to extract the spinal fluid.

594
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:33,000
按住他的头
Hold his head still.

595
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,030
马丁  我给你说  他知道了
He knows, Martin, I'm telling you.

596
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
不  奥利维亚  他不知道
No, Olivia, he doesn't.

597
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,050
最坏的情况会是  他产生了怀疑
Worst case, he has a suspicion.

598
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,087
我是说他根本没有时间
I mean he never actually had the time

599
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,016
去听那段录音
to listen to the recording.

600
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:05,063
是的
No.

601
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,023
好  而且他也没机会听了
Okay, and he never will,

602
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,070
因为你已经毁了数据卡  对吧
Because you destroyed the data card, right?

603
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,056
当然
Of course.

604
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,063
那么我们安全了  是吧
Then we're fine, all right?

605
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:14,000
只要你保持清晰的思路  别慌就行
So long as you keep thinking clearly and don't panic.

606
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,026
马丁  你忘了是我结束了他的职业生涯
You're forgetting I ended this man's career, Martin.

607
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,036
他不会错过扳倒我的任何机会  永远不会
He won't let me off the hook, ever.

608
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:21,040
你是总统的女儿  对吧
You're the president's daughter, okay?

609
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,020
相信我  在没有确凿证据前
Trust me, no one will come after you

610
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,040
没人会找你的麻烦
Without hard evidence.

611

我得挂了

614

总统在找你

619

在那边

623
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,026
你看见他去哪边了吗

624
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,023
一片混乱  到处都有人在跑
It was chaos. There were people running everywhere.

625
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
詹尼斯  我是蕾妮
Janis, It's Renee.

626
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
说

627

男嫌犯还在逃

628
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,050
金·鲍尔不见了

629
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,033
她不是去追他就是被挟持了
Either she went after him, or she's a hostage.

630
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,083
对所有通道发出优先警告

631
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,096
警官  我叫金·鲍尔

632
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:30,096
我正在追踪刚在航空集散站开枪的人
I'm following the man who shot up the terminal.

633
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:34,043
你得和调查局的蕾妮·沃克探员联系
You need to contact special agent Renee Walker with the FBI.

634
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,070
金  我是蕾妮  请讲
Kim, it's Renee. Go ahead.

635
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,070
我找到他了  他在南停车场车库
I've got him. he's in the south parking garage.

636
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,070
你现在是否看到他

637
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,013
没  他在我的楼上
No. He's on one of the upper levels

638
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,033
我在出口处

639

金

644
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,006
给你

645
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:23,015
你受伤了  我检查下你的手臂
You're hurt. Let me see your arm.

646
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,045
没事  听我说  蕾妮
No, listen to me, Renee.

647
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,068
那台笔记本上有摄像头
That laptop has the camera

648
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:27,009
他们用它来跟踪我
They were using to track me.

649
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:28,070
用的是D11反向路由器
With a D-11 inverse router,

650
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,009
我们也许能反追踪那个信号
We may be able to back trace the signal

651
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,042
从而找到绑架我爸爸的人
To the people that have my father.

652
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:34,049
我以前是反恐小组的系统分析员
I worked at CTU, systems analyst.

653
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,009
你们办公室有人可以帮我们吗
Is there anyone back at your office that can help us with this?

654
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:38,052
有  克罗伊?奥布赖恩
Yeah, I've got Chloe O'brian standing by.

655
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:40,062
和她通电话
Get her on the phone.

656
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,026
一旦你做了决定并一干到底
Once this happens, once it goes through,

657
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,057
就没有回头路可走了
You can never go back.

658
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,042
你后半生的日子恐怕就难过了
You will live with it for the rest of your life.

659
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,002
我不需要你们来给我训话
I don't need a lecture on conscience from you of all people.

660
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,029
我已认真考虑过此事
I have thought this through.

661
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:51,075
我不能忍受让那个畜生逍遥法外
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.

662
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:53,082
他必须为他所做的付出代价
He has to pay for what he did.

663
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:02,005
病毒含量比预期的要高
The virus load is even higher than we hoped for.

664
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:04,005
每单位脊髓液中含有十多个单位病毒
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone.

665
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,012
不足以重组病毒
Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen, of course.

666
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:09,029
我们需要他的器官
We'll still need his organs for that.

667
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,019
他看起来不太好
He doesn't look too good.

668
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,095
他还能活多长时间
How much longer does he have?

669
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:17,085
几个小时吧  具体时间不能确定
A couple of hours, give or take.

670
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,055
如果他在我们提取病毒以前死了怎么办
And what happens if he dies before we extract the pathogen?

671
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,085
最好是能保证病毒携带者存活
Obviously, it's optimal to keep the host alive,

672
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:30,085
但病原体可以在他死后多存活两小时
But the pathogen could survive up to two hours after death,

673
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,085
或者更久
Sometimes even longer.

674
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:33,065
事实上  唯一除掉病毒的方法
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it

675
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:34,068
就是放在500摄氏度的高温环境中
Is by exposure to extreme

676
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:37,022
需要五百摄氏度以上的高温
Temperatures above 500-degrees celsius.

677
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:40,078
务必把那写在报告中
Make sure you put that in your report.

678
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,082
我会的  我已经发到你电脑上去了
I have, and I've already uploaded it to your computer.

679
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:46,088
很好  准备转移他
Good. Get him ready to move.

680
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:49,058
拿担架
Get the stretcher.

681
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:54,025
鲍尔有利用价值  但你需要保证相应设备
Bauer is viable, But you'll need to secure a facility.

682
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:55,082
那个好说
That won't be a problem

683
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,065
你一直都非常清楚
As long as you're absolutely certain

684
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,049
这方面我们会搞定的
That we can accomplish this.

685
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,055
我们已经啃下最硬的骨头了  艾伦
We've already done the hard part, Alan.

686
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,021
据我所知
And from what I understand,

687
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,072
有了适用的设备  纯血样提取
With the proper equipment, the actual extraction

688
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:07,009
以及人工器官移植就不成问题了
And bioengineering is fairly straightforward.

689
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:11,032
好的卡拉  我会和其他人联系  干得好
Okay, Cara, I'll contact the others. Good work.

690
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:14,029
他们要知道  该谢的还有阿尔梅达
They should know they have Almeida to thank for this.

691
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,075
是他意识到鲍尔是个问题解决途径
He's the one who realized Bauer was a possible source.

692
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,049
转达我的谢意
Relay my gratitude.

693
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:21,068
我认为你可以考虑更长远一些
I think you should consider going farther than that.

694
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,045
什么意思   你有何高见
Farther? What did you have in mind?

695
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:28,035
托尼和我们一条心
Tony believes in what we're doing.

696
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,058
他想担当更重要的角色
He wants to play a larger role.

697
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:33,068
听起来有点不靠谱
That sounds premature to me.

698
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,095
事实上  艾伦
The thing is, Alan,

699
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:37,055
如果我们不礼贤下士的话
If we don't make a significant gesture,

700
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:39,078
恐怕我们会失去他这个人才
I'm afraid we may lose him.

701
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:42,025
我甚至都不了解他  卡拉
I don't even know this man, Cara.

702
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:45,039
那么你就该去了解他
Then you should get to know him.

703
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,005
你该不会是建议我和他见面吧
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

704
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:50,072
听着  我强调的是
Look, all I'm saying is

705
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:54,005
他会成为组织里振臂一呼  应者云集的人物
That he would be a very useful voice in the mix.

706
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,042
他的实战经验弥补了
His field experience fills a knowledge gap,

707
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,088
我们计划中理论上的不足
In regards to our logistics and planning.

708
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:01,052
你这么说  是要大力保举他咯
Well, coming from you, That's a hell of a recommendation.

709
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,075
他就是不二人选了  艾伦
There's no one better, alan.

710
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:05,018
你不能像你查清组织里
And it's not as if you haven't vetted

711
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,076
其他每个成员的底子那样办
every other member of the group.

712
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:10,062
也许是时候该和他见个面了
Maybe it is time that he and I met.

713
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:16,019
我半小时之内到你那里
I could be there where you are in the next half hour.

714
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,025
你过来
You're coming here?

715
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,019
我认为这会是个好点子
I think it would be a good idea

716
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,015
如果由我亲自监督转移鲍尔的事
If I supervised Bauer's transfer myself;

717
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,005
我会让别人觉得轻松点  不是吗
Make the others feel at ease, don't you think?

718
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,022
但是拉卡  我要亲眼见下阿尔梅达
But, Cara, I'll look Almeida in the eye,

719
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:31,092
如果他有哪点让我看得不爽
And if, for any reason, I don't like what I see,

720
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,029
你清楚后果
You understand.

721
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,092
我不会让他活着离开
I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive.

722
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,062
我知道
I understand.

723
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,025
他想见你
He wants to meet you.

724
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,025
他一会就到
He'll be here in little while.

725
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:53,092
谢谢
Thank you.

726
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,019
一切看你自己表现了
It's up to you now.

727
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:10,029
把轮床推过来点
Wheel the gurney closer.

728
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,068
他太虚弱了走不了那么远
He's too weak to have gotten very far.

729
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,055
掩护南边出口  我去这边
Cover the north exit. I'll go this way.

730
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:49,055
