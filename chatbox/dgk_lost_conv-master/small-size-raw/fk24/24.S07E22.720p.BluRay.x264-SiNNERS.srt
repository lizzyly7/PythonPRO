有一线希望  我可能救得了你

我快死了
I'm dying.

5

即便有能让我幸存的一线生机
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,096
我也决不愿承受  让你坐在我身边
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,083
看我死去时的那种切肤之痛
Sit there and watch me die.

-一直到袭击白宫  -什么

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,036
他还该为我弟弟的死负责
He's also responsible for the death of my brother.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,010
你要知道的就是霍奇斯拿到了协议
All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.

19

证人保护协议  我母亲批准了

20
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,087
然后他就会逍遥法外  除非有人出面干涉

21
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:02,026
我会给你联系方式  价钱

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,043
但没有谈成
But I couldn't go through with it.

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,016
吉布安  听我说
Listen to me, Jibraan.

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,066
如果你不照我说的做
If you don't do exactly as I say,

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,023
你会眼睁睁看着你弟弟死在你面前
You're going to watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.

33
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,043
你对我哥做了什么
What have you done to my brother?

34
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:37,003
你给他洗脑了吗  这根本就不是我哥
You've poisoned his mind! This isn't my brother!

35
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,083
我们在找一个在这里朝拜的人

他叫吉布安·阿尔扎利安  你认识他吗

我认识他  但他不是恐怖分子

我们来不是要和你争论这个问题

肆无忌惮的指控
An outrageous accusation,

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,013
没有合法的搜查令  还威胁我

44
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:57,026
我没有威胁你

暂时还没

46
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:01,000
但我们都知道接下来会发生什么
But we both know where this is going.

47
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,066
杰克  我是克罗伊  我发现

在6个月内总共存入了2百万美元
Was deposited into his account over a period of six months?

51
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,096
那不对  时间被提前了
Well, that wasn't right. They were backdated.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,070
他浏览过的那些极端分子网站呢

00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,023
网站访问时间是30分钟前被篡改提前的

55
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,020
吉布安很可能是无辜的

56
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,070

那是吉布安的弟弟  哈米德
That's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

62
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:30,013
他们以他来要挟  让吉布安唯命是从
They're using him as leverage to make Jibraan do what they want.

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,002

How can you be sure?

64
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,050
因为若是我也会这么干
Because that's what I would have done.

65
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,096

00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:03,016
只是保守数字

关于这次计划他知道多少
What's his level of awareness regarding the plan?

要到回天无力的地步他才会知道

你还没有告诉我到底要我做什么
You still haven't told me what you want me to do.

现在我只想让你搭地铁

吉布安  你现在唯一要担心的
Jibraan, the only person you need to worry about right now

00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,046
你让我联系的那个人说
The man you put me in touch with said

303
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,026
不收到钱他不会动手
He wouldn't act until he received payment.

304
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,010
如果没人给他酬劳
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges

305
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:01,040
他为什么还是下手干掉了霍奇斯呢
If he wasn't paid?

306
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,090
因为是我给他下的令
Because I told him to.

307
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,063
什么
What?

308
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,063
他打电话给我说
He called me and told me

309
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,090
钱还没到账
The money hadn't come through yet.

310
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:10,006
我告诉他你是懂规矩的  让他下手
I told him you were good for it and to proceed.

311
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,076
为什么  马丁  为什么这么做
Why, Martin? why would you do that?

312
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,086
霍奇斯马上就要进入证人保护计划
Hodges was going into Witness Protection,

313
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,030
这是最后下手的机会
There was a finite window of opportunity.

314
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,003
况且这正合你意啊
And because it's what you wanted.

315
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,040
对吧
Right?

316
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,070
尽管我再三警告你要三思
Despite all my warnings for you to reconsider,

317
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,020
你还是直视着我的眼睛
You looked me straight in the eye

318
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,090
告诉我你要霍奇斯死  非死不可
And you said you wanted Hodges dead, to make it happen.

319
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,093
我按你的意思做了  现在你梦想成真了
And I did, and he's dead.

320
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,030
天哪
Oh, my god...

321
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,080
可我的通话记录
But my phone records...

322
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,063
-电脑使用记录全都没清除   - 别操心
- M-my computer... everything...   - Don't worry about any of those.

323
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:40,036
我会给你传个程序  删除网页使用痕迹
I'll send you a program to erase your internet tracks.

324
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,066
你给我打的电话不会引起怀疑
The calls to me mean nothing.

325
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,083
奥利维亚  在你付诸行动之后
Olivia, the time to worry about your conscience

326
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:48,090
就没有良心谴责的后悔药可吃了
Was before you put this in motion.

327
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,076
如果你让这种不安控制了你
If you let this eat away at you,

328
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,010
别人就会注意到你的反常  并产生怀疑
People are going to notice and get suspicious.

329
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,083
你会把我们两个都拖下水
You will bring us both down...

330
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,063
还会殃及到你的母亲和她的政府
Destroy your mother and her administration.

331
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,013
想清楚  这是你想要的结果吗
Think about it. Is that what you want?

332
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,056
不是
No.

333
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,036
好  那就振作精神
Okay, then pull yourself together.

334
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,036
我答应你  你要是照我的话做
I promise you, this will all pass

335
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,010
我们都会相安无事
If you do what I say.

336
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,063
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

337
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,063
说
Say it.

338
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,026
我能做到
I can do it.

339
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,060
奥利维亚  你得先把钱汇过去
You need to transfer the funds, Olivia.

340
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,080
别让这个家伙对你不满
You do not want this man unhappy with you.

341
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,060
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

342
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,093
抱歉把你吵醒了
Sorry I woke you.

343
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,023
不不不  没关系
No, no, no, that's okay.

344
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,036
我被泰莉吵醒好多回了
I've been up with Teri a couple times anyway.

345
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,020
她一晚上都不得安宁
She's been having a rough night.

346
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,066
她应该是想妈妈了
I think she misses her mother.

347
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,046
听着
Oh, well, listen,

348
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,020
我打电话来是告诉你我的航班晚点了
I just called to let you know that my flight's been delayed.

349
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,076
好  晚了多久
Yeah, how long?

350
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,086
机场人员说是一个小时
Well, they're saying an hour.

351
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,020
实际可能晚点两个小时
Which probably means two.

352
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,063
好
Okay.

353
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,076
怎么了
What?

354
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,016
不知道  也许你该把这视为一种天意
I don't know, maybe you should see this as a sign.

355
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,053
天意
A sign?

356
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,053
暗示你该留在那里  努力说服你父亲
That you should stay there-- try to convince your father

357
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,046
就算他时日不多
That, uh, he should be spending whatever time

358
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,016
他也该和他的独生女一起度过
He has left with his only daughter.

359
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,040
尽管我很想陪他
As much as I want to,

360
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,016
他还是把话说得很清楚
He made it very clear

361
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,060
他不想让我陪在他身边看他死去
That he does not want me around to watch him die.

362
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:19,090
好吧
Okay, all right.

363
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,023
抱歉我谈起了令你不快的话题
Sorry I brought it up.

364
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,060
我和泰莉会去机场接你
Teri and I will be at the airport to pick you up.

365
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,023
我手机电量不足了
My battery is dying.

366
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:30,016
医院那边没意见吗
Is the hospital okay with that?

367
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,023
没  我和凯文谈过了
Yeah, I talked to Kevin.

368
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,050
他说会找人替我
He said he'd cover my rounds.

369
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,063
那真是  太好了
Well, that's-that's... that's great.

370
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,033
我等不及要见到你们了
Well, I can't wait to see you guys.

莎拉  登机证呢

我看到你放进大衣口袋了  亲爱的

杰克  我破解了托尼的定位数据

疑犯在一辆黑色货车里

一种移动电脑  但几乎全被他破坏了

这电脑和这次恐怖袭击一定有关

联系克罗伊  看有什么发现

那就试试恢复部分数据

看来我能修复超便携移动电脑
Looks like I can reconstruct the memory state

422
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,055
被破坏时的内存数据
of the UMPC at the time it was damaged.

423
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,016
不行  里面完好无损的数据不够

424
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,040
不  只读存储器模块里有

425
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,083
许多掌上设备都在那备份了内存数据
A lot of handheld devices back up their memory state there.

426
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:24,092
这不可能修复
That can't be done,

427
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:26,066
-没有文件头就不行  -真的吗

你不告诉我  我不会停手

我已一无所有
I have nothing left to lose.

438

你快告诉我毒气罐的位置  要不然
You either tell me where that canister is, or so help me god,

439
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,006
我现在就把你就地正法
I will lay you down right here, right now.

你觉得我还有什么可以失去呢  杰克
You think I've got anything left to lose, Jack?

441
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:45,092
开枪吧
Do it.

00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,006
大量的小程序已经运行
There were a number of applets running.

443
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:01,086

444
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,029
我正上传镜像文件给你

我不知道  但不管是谁
I can't tell. But whoever it is,

从另一边出来了
And out the other side.

452

你是说我们丧失了那个毒气罐

605
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,088
该死

我们将前功尽弃

你得把他干掉

613
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,075
我跟你讲  那根本没必要

托尼不会被长时间关押

是的  女士  我可以理解

我觉得需要有个人能倾听我的心事

What can I do for you?

678
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,031
卡宁先生  几年前
Mr. Kanin, some years ago,

679
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:22,095
当我在帕默尔总统身边当保镖时

00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:27,035
我注意到了一些参谋长办公室规程的变更
I was made aware of some modifications made to the chief of staff's office.

你的意思是在迈克·诺威克的任期中

682
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:34,041
是的  长官  尤其是录音监听系统
Yes, sir, specifically the installation of a voice-activated recording system.

683

使得联席会议会被录音存档

如果你问我是否使用了这套设备

回答是  是的我用了
The answer's yes.

686
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,011
长官  当你辞职并离开办公室的时候
Sir, did you disconnect it when you resigned

687
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,018
你关闭了装置吗
And left your office?

688
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,021
没有  怎么了
No. why you asking?

689
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,042
我请求现在暂不回答
I'd prefer not to answer that at this time.

690
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:53,025
我想知道如何进入数码录音设备
I need to know how to access the digital recorder.

691
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:56,095
你进不去的  有生物识别锁

00:37:56,098 --> 00:37:58,002
你需要我的指纹
You need my thumbprint.

693
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:00,055
亚伦  如果你需要我的帮助

694
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:03,068
你就先告诉我这是怎么回事
You're gonna have to tell me what this is about.

695
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:07,002
奥利维亚·泰勒还在使用我的办公室
Olivia Taylor's still using my office.

696
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:10,032
这和她有什么直接联系吗
Does this have to do with her?

697
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:13,018
电话里我真的没法讲清楚
I really can't talk about this over the phone right now.

698
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:17,042
我半小时之内到白宫来
I'll be at the White House within a half hour.

699
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,028
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

700
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,036
你不觉得你有些事需要和我说说吗
Do you have something you'd like to say to me?

701
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,075
什么事情
Like what?

702
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:54,075
我觉得你自己心知肚明
Oh, I think you know.

703
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,005
我不知道
I don't think I do.

704
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,087
不如对我说  "干得好  詹尼斯
How about "good job, Janice,

705
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:00,038
超便携电脑修复得很好"
on reconstructing the UMPC"?

706
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,098
或者说  "也许我早该想到
Or "just maybe I should have considered the possibility

707
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,038
你确有两把刷子的可能性"
That you actually know what you're doing."

708
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,008
你不了解我
Oh, you don't know me,

709
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,088
如果你了解了  你就会明白
But if you did, you would understand

710
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,055
那是你最后才需要确认的地方
That this is the last place you should look for any type of validation.

711
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,048
你怎么就死不认错呢
How about just acknowledging you were wrong?!

712
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:18,008
我们准备好出发了
We're almost ready to go.

713
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:20,008
好  是她吗
Okay. is this her?

714
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:24,005
是她  但我在首府警局看到她时
Uh, yes, but when I saw her in the Metro,

715
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:28,012
她戴着黑色假发  穿了件皮衣
she had on this dark wig and a leather jacket.

716

721
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,062
没有低咖啡因咖啡
Didn't have decaf,

722
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:06,018
所以我一直走到那边尽头去了
So I had to go all the way to the other end of the terminal,

723
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:10,028
总之搞到了
But I want you to know I got it.

我做不到你的要求
