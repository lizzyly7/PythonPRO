是国安局的鲍勃·科内尔打来的电话

还没确认  但CIP装置已被启用
Not yet, but they believe the cip device is being utilized.

7
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:28,066
我们必须假定杜巴库在酝酿另一次攻击

8
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,000

要么在一小时内照我说的做
Comply with my demands within the hour,

17
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:48,002
否则1万多美国人会因此丧命

沃克无足轻重

23
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:15,027
到这之前杀了她

拉里  这么做不值得
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.

25
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:17,074
已没有什么线索了
There's nothing here.

她还生死未卜呢
We don't know that she's dead yet!

30
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,081
我把我的一切都贡献给了调查局
I've devoted my life to the bureau

31
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,025
而你却要我相信
And you just expect me to believe

32
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,002
整个政府都腐朽不堪
That the entire government's been corrupted.

00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,039
也不全是
Not all of them.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,092
在找到主谋前  我们不能相信任何人
But until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,086
凭你们四个就能阻止这一切吗

00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,086
我们必须这么做

37
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,099

因为

54
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,053
马托波夫妇在我们手中  这才是关键

55

要是行不通的话我会立刻放弃
And I will drop it the minute it feels cold.

是你告诉我他和蕾妮的事

四十分钟前  我跟盖奇特工说过了

320
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,050
我觉得"愤怒"用得有点过了
I think the word "outrage" might be too strong

321
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,010

543

杰克  警察马上就到了

西恩  国家安全局和国土安全局

都搞不懂汲沦谷攻击为什么停止了

詹尼斯正在协助数码鉴证组

556
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:51,028
并把工厂的信息发给他们
That she sent over to the plant.

557
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:53,045
这讲不通啊
This doesn't make any sense.

558
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,041
为什么杜巴库突然停止了这次攻击
Why... why would dubaku suddenly stop an attack

559
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,082
他离成功只差几分钟了
When he was minutes away from causing mass casualties?

560
00:27:57,082 --> 00:28:00,015
或许CIP装置出问题了

561
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:02,032
不  我不要猜测  我只想知道事实

我不知道该说什么了  先生
I don't know what else to tell you, sir.

565

我知道您对蕾妮的事很不安

但是对我发脾气也是无济于事
But getting angry at me is not going to make it go any faster.

567
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:15,090
如果你认为我是因为沃克探员的事

568
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,087
而对你大喊大叫  那你就错了

00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,044

我要你和詹尼斯同国安局合作

找到CIP装置的具体位置

574
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:34,002
只要我们找到装置  就能找到杜巴库

谢谢您的来电

詹尼斯  拉里让你和国安局合作

工厂快速反应小组的负责人
The head of the response team at the plant.

581
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:02,031
他怎么说
What did he say?

00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,075
设备已经安全了
Facility's clean.

583
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,099
少量的化学气体发生了泄露
A trace amount of the chemical was released, but not enough

584
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,085
但不足以造成伤害  现场已经被保护起来了

585
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,002
很好

00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,039

我想通知布拉诺先生的家人
I'd like to track down mr. brunner's family.

593
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,083
我是最后一个和他通话的人
I was the last one to speak with him,

594
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,037
我认为应该让他们知道他是多么勇敢
And I feel they should know how brave he was.

595
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,067
我找找看
I'll see what I can find.

596
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:26,011
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,087
詹尼斯  在节哀之前

00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:31,018
你应该先找出CIP装置的具体位置

清理小组已经到达现场
Cleanup crews are already on site

601
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,036
我们正在进行工厂周围

602
00:29:57,037 --> 00:29:58,073
1英里的疏散撤离工作

603
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,099

604
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,050
实际死亡  只有一人 是工厂的经理
There was, in fact, one casualty, The plant manager.

剩余因化学品烧伤和吸入有毒气体

而受伤的13名工人已被送去急救

607
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,040
再就没有任何针对防火墙的入侵行动吗
And there haven't been any other intrusions in the firewall?

608
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,017
没有了  女士
No, ma'am.

609
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,091
看起来好像危机已经解除了
It appears the crisis has been averted.

610
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:14,044
除此以外  没人能解释
Except that no one's been able

611
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,018
防火墙为什么又安全了
To explain how the firewall break disengaged.

612
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,055
目前是的
Not yet.

613
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:20,025
联邦调查局也毫无头绪
The fbi has no idea how it happened... it just happened.

614
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,012
这讲不通
And that's not an explanation.

615
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,095
可能杜巴库正要发布另一个警告
Perhaps dubaku was firing another warning shot.

616
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:27,022
不可能  杜巴库已经弄下了两架飞机
No, dubaku's already down two planes.

617
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:28,099
他不会在乎死更多的人
He's not afraid to take more lives.

618
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,009
不管怎么说  我们现在安全了
In any event, we should be grateful.

619
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,056
除非知道真相  否则我是不会
I'm not one to accept good news

620
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:36,067
接受这样的好消息的
Unless I know where it comes from.

621
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,004
找出真相前  我要维持目前的安全等级
Until we have more answers, I want to maintain alert levels.

622
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,094
什么事
Yes?

623
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:45,041
总统阁下  史密斯上将在2号线
Madam president, I have admiral Smith on line two.

624
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:48,081
接进来  谢谢你  蒂姆
Put him through. thank you, tim.

625
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,054
上将
Admiral?

626
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:55,002
我一直在打盖奇探员的电话  但始终没人接
I've been trying to reach agent gedge, and he hasn't picked up.

627
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,049
是的  我确定号码没错
Yes, I'm sure I have the right number.

628
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,072
一小时前我刚跟他通过话
I just spoke to him over an hour ago.

629
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:02,049
他说他在萨曼莎·罗斯的公寓外面
He said he was outside samantha roth's apartment

630
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,099
在等第一先生
Waiting for the first gentleman.

631
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,033
找到他
Just find him.

632
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:11,037
我不管你派谁去
I don't care who you have to pull off shift.

633
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,080
还是联系不上盖奇
Still can't reach gedge.

634
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,068
特勤处也找不到他
The secret service doesn't know where he is either.

635
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:19,087
我需要告诉总统
I need to tell the president.

636
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,014
或许你得等等
Maybe you should hold off.

637
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,084
目前的危机又升级了
The domestic threat's been lifted for now

638
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:25,035
她正和史密斯上将通话
And she's on the phone with admiral smith.

639
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,002
我不能批准空中打击
I can't authorize the air strikes

640
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,002
除非我们出兵计划已经妥当
Until our post-invasion plans are in place.

641
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:36,032
在找到可行性方案之前
Finding a politically viable replacement, until that happens,

642
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:39,073
我要求军队全面戒备
You need to keep your forces at full readiness.

643
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:42,026
参谋长们已经等得不耐烦了
The joint chiefs are getting impatient.

644
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:46,061
总统阁下  我们需要谈谈您的丈夫
Madam president, we need to talk about your husband.

645
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:52,014
对于令郎的死
His theory about your son's death,

646
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:54,034
他还是难以释怀
He hasn't let it go.

647
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:57,001
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

648
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,092
他去质询罗杰的女友
He's been harassing roger's girlfriend,

649
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:04,029
认为她参与了罗杰的谋杀
Accusing her of complicity in the death of roger.

650
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,059
亨利和我跟着联调局
Henry and I went over it

651
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,012
一次又一次地调查
Again and again with the fbi,

652
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:10,043
后来他向我发誓 他不会再纠结于此了
And he swore to me He was past all that.

653
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,056
他找到了一个迎合他的
Well, he's found a private investigator who's feeding

654
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,076
谋杀理论的私人侦探
His conspiracy theory;

655
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:16,016
他在被人利用
Taking advantage of him.

656
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:18,008
请让亨利来听电话
Please get henry on the phone.

657
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:21,012
恐怕不行
I'm afraid I can't do that.

658
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,026
我联系不上他
Henry's unreachable.

659
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:28,036
什么意思
I don't understand.

660
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:30,086
盖奇探员的电话无人接听
Agent gedge hasn't been answering his phone.

661
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:34,063
我应该早点告诉你的
I probably should have told you before.

662
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:38,010
你是说我丈夫失踪了吗
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

663
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:42,031
特勤组已经发出通告
Secret service has put out an apb.

664
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:45,054
他们正在去罗斯小姐的家中
They're going to ms. roth's apartment.

665
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:50,026
无论发生了什么  我都会很快查清
Whatever's going on, I will find out soon enough.

666
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:58,096
这是代号 查理-0-查理的优先命令
This is a priority order code charlie zero charlie.

667
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:01,082
需要立即找到盖奇探员
We need an immediate 20 on agent gedge.

668
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,096
所有外勤探员立即出发
All available field agents proceed

669
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:09,000
至威尔金森路404号 代号 查理-0-查理
404 wilkinson drive. Code charlie zero charlie.

670
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,020
你正在犯错误
You're making a mistake.

671
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:23,069
好好想想
Think about it.

672
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,073
闭嘴
Shut up!

673
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:25,076
你没杀过人
You haven't killed anybody yet.

674
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:27,047
你没必要这么做
You don't need to do this.

675
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:31,077
盖奇陷害我的计划已经失败了
Gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.

676
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:34,020
如果你杀了我
If you kill me,

677
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,031
他们就会查出来这是谋杀
They'll know it was murder,

678
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,062
并会由此找到你
And they'll trace it back to you.

679
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,019
说
Go ahead.

680
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,079
盖奇探员去哪了  我联系不到他
Where's agent gedge? I can't reach him.

681
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,089
盖奇死了
Gedge is dead.

682
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,009
出什么事了
What happened?

683
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,043
本应按计划进行
Everything was going according to plan...

684
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:58,076
但还是了问题
But something went wrong.

685
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:01,024
泰勒杀了盖奇  我不知道他怎么做到的
Taylor killed gedge; I don't know how.

686
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,023
泰勒先生现在在哪里
Where's mr. taylor now?

687
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,060
在我旁边
He's right here.

688
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:07,064
别杀他  把他带到我这
Don't kill him, bring him to me.

689
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,025
明白
Yes, sir.

690
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:30,000
马托波总理  夫人  请跟我来
Prime minister matobo, ma'am, please come with me.

691
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,014
克罗伊  用卫星查看瑞特大厦
Chloe, pull up the ritter building on a satellite grid.

692
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:36,004
查看杜巴库离开留下的痕迹
Look for any sign of dubaku leaving the site.

693
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:37,051
我们必须找到他
We've got to find him.

694
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,088
我需要20分钟来设置卫星
It's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.

695
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,031
那就别浪费口舌
Then don't waste time talking about it.

696
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,081
调出卫星和交通摄像头
Pull up satellite and traffic cams,

697
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,018
监视街角和汽车站
Street corners and metro stations.

698
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,022
先干什么
What's the priority?

699
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,005
我一次只能做一件事情
I can only do one thing at a time.

700
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,065
-卫星  -好吧
- Satellite!  - fine.

701
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,009
比尔  我们必须重新考虑一下
Bill, we need to rethink this.

702
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:52,049
你什么意思
What do you mean?

703
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,092
你原计划监控一次卧底行动
You were set up to surveil an undercover operation.

704
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:55,099
现在卧底身份暴露了
Your cover's been blown.

705
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,039
警察还在找我们
The police are after us.

706
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,020
我们无法在百万人口的城市找一个人
We are not equipped to look for one man in a city of millions.

707
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,090
我们需要其它的资源
We need additional resources.

708
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,007
你有何建议
What are you suggesting?

709

是时候和外面部门联系了
It's time to contact outside agencies.

710
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,060
-政府吗  -是的
- The government?  - yes.

711
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,037
我记得你说过政府是不可信的
I thought you said the government couldn't be trusted.

712
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,054
现在  我们别无选择
Right now, we don't have a choice.

713
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:12,057
我们不能相信它
It can't be trusted.

714
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:13,074
我们不能信任任何人
We can't trust anybody,

715
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,004
这就是为什么我们独自行动
That's why we're working on the outside.

716
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,095
泰勒总统可以被信任
President taylor can be trusted.

717
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:18,071
我并不怀疑这点  总理
I'm not questioning that, prime minister.

718
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,072
而是她身边的人无法被信任
It's the people around her who can't be trusted.

719
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:23,012
布坎南先生  杰克是对的  我们需要帮助
Mr. buchanan, jack's right. we need help.

720
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,039
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

721
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,089
我们可以限制消息的去向
We can limit the flow of information.

722
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:28,072
总理可以帮我们
Prime minister matobo can get us past

723
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,089
直接向总统解释清楚
Explain to her why and what we're doing.

724
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,096
我觉得杰克是对的
I think jack's right.

725
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:34,083
我们在那栋楼里留下了太多的痕迹
We left a lot of clues in that building.

726
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,010
我们不能在冒险
We're vulnerable; we can't do this

727
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,023
单干下去了
On our own anymore.

728
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:39,030
难道我要和你们继续躲下去
Am I supposed to remain in hiding with you,

729
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,070
装成我和我夫人被绑架
Pretend that my wife and i

730
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,000
或被杀了吗
Are still being held hostage or dead?

731
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,048
我必须返回白宫
I need to return to the white house

732
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:48,054
帮助总统挽救我的国家
And help the president save what's left of my country.

733
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:50,011
让我的丈夫去吧
Let my husband do this.

734
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,008
让他给泰勒总统打电话
Let him call president taylor.

735
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,052
她会听他的
She will listen to him.

736
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,066
比尔  要想找到杜巴库  让他打电话
Bill, you want to find dubaku, make the call.

737
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:13,050
好吧
All right.

738
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,020
给我接白宫
Get me the white house.

739
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,098
博伊德化工厂的代表们
Representatives from boyd chemical

740
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:23,058
向当地政府部门保证
Have assured local authorities

741

当前危机已经过去了
That the immediate crisis has passed.

742
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:27,082
但这仍无法缓解汲沦谷镇
However, this has done little to calm the nerves

743
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:30,065
民众的紧张情绪
Of the citizens of kidron, ohio,

744
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:34,032
他们中的许多人跑到附近的社区避难
Many of whom have taken shelter in neighboring communities.

745
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,029
我们再次确认只有一人

你能追踪电话吗

00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,094
我们试了  总统阁下  但它是保密线路
