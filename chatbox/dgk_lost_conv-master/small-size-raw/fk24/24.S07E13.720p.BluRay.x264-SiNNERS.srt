副总统黑沃斯当时不在白宫内

据悉他已被转移到安全地带

联邦调查局已设置了九重警戒线

57
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,057
副总统阁下

00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,077
是莫斯探员
That was agent moss.

他仍然请求您下令实施营救行动
He's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation.

61
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,058
他有没有进一步关于里面情况的情报

但是设备受到静电干扰
but all they were able get static.

65
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,052
他们认为朱玛正使用某种干扰设备
They think juma's using some kind of jamming equipment.

66
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,090
我们在白宫周围每个可以监测到的角度

67
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,025

但仍然看不到里边的情况
But they haven't been able to see inside.

69
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:56,023
那我们还是搞不清朱玛是否抓到了总统
We still don't know whether juma has the president,

70
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:59,000
或者总统是否还躲在安全屋里
Or whether the president is lked inside the safe room?

71
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,020
是的  目前还不清楚
No, sir, we don't.

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,033
在我了解总统的处境之前
I will not authorize any action

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,067
不会下任何行动指令
Until i know the status of the president.

74
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,094
就这么回复莫斯探员
Relay that to agent moss.

75
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,007
是的  阁下
Yes, sir.

76

妈妈  我知道我伤透了您的心

77
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:21,052
对不起  是我拒您于千里之外
I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life.

78
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,009
-没关系  -不  不对
- It's okay - no, it isn't.

79
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:26,086
您把我从竞选里开除是对的
You were right to fire me off the campaign.

80
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:29,059
我当时觉得您抛弃了我  所以一直不理您
I felt so betrayed, i turned my back on you.

81
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,043
奥利维亚  别再想这些了
Olivia, don't worry about it.

82
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,056
现在想想  当时太傻了
It all seems so stupid now.

00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:36,033
希望您能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

亲爱的  我早就原谅你了
Darling, i forgave you a long time ago.

85
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,097
利维  听我说
Livy, you have to listen to me.

86
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,058
我们不会有事的
We really are going to be okay.

87
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,088
你只需睁大眼睛时刻准备好
Just keep your eyes open and be ready.

88
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:53,065
阿博
Abo.

89

别碰她
Leave her alone!

91
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,069
-离她远点儿  -回去
- Get away from her! - get back!

92
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,062
别碰她  求你了
I said leave her alone! please!

93
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,069
奥利维亚  没事的  亲爱的
Olivia, it's okay, darling. it's okay!

94
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,043
比尔  我们得有所行动了
Bill, we need to move

95
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,086
把总统救出来
To try to save the president.

96
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,086
怎么干
How?

97
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,020
在安全屋里
In the lockdown room,

98
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:11,010
有5瓶CH-4虑毒罐
There were five canisters of ch-4.

99
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,090
咱们向朱玛投降之前 我把瓶口打开
Before we surrendered ourselves over to juma, i open the mouth

100
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,024
五分钟之内
Within the next few minutes,

101
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,017
那个房间会充满天然气
That room is going to be saturated with natural gas.

102
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,089
有一点火花就会爆炸
It's going to take one spark to set it off.

103
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,061
爆炸足够干掉大多数朱玛的手下
I think the explosion is going to be large enough to take out most of juma's men.

104
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,045
那时候你就行动
That's when you can make your move

105
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,095
怎么引爆
How do we set it off?

106
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,068
我跑到安全屋那儿
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.

107
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,095
引开他们的火力
Try and draw their fire.

108
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,049
只要一个流弹就够了
All we need is one stray bullet.

109
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:32,072
那等于自杀  杰克
That's a suicide play, jack.

110
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,056
没得选了
We don't have a choice.

111
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,089
只要确保你能救出总统
Just make sure you can get to the president

带她从这儿逃出去

她知道这个计划  并时刻准备着

114

你们在搞什么阴谋诡计

115
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,007
是不是要行动了
Are you going to do something?

116

等我们行动时你就知道了  参议员

妈的  我要知道你们

00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,022
稍等
Hold on.

152
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,042
阁下  莫斯探员在视频会议上
Sir, it's agent  moss on teleconference.

153
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,055
接过来
Put him on.

154
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,039
阁下  你也看到那个视频了吧
Sir, are you getting this?

155
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:23,019
是的  全世界都看到了
Yes. so is the rest of the damn world.

156
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,093
副总统阁下  我相信朱玛来这里
Mr. vice president, i believe juma came here

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,083
是为了羞辱并在世人面前处决总统
To humiliate the president and stage a public execution.

158
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,043
营救行动已经准备好
We have a rescue operation in place.

159
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,087
就等您一声令下了
All we need is your authorization.

160
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,040
你根本就不知道朱玛究竟意欲何为
You don't know what juma's intentions are.

161
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,037
这可能只是他今后一系列条件的前奏
This could be a prelude to a set of demands.

162
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:36,091
他根本就不是来谈条件的  阁下
There are no demands here, sir.

163
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,061
他就是为了以牙还牙
This is about revenge.

164
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,078
朱玛知道他不可能活着走出白宫
Juma knows he'll never get out of the white house alive.

165
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,024
这只是你的推测  莫斯探员
You're speculating, agent moss.

166
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,088
我的顾问认为  最谨慎的做法
My advisor are telling me the most prudent course of action

167
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:48,005
就是和朱玛谈判
Is to try to initiate communication with juma.

168
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,059
我们已经试过了  他没有回应
We've been trying to do that. he hasn't responded.

169
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,052
阁下  朱玛根本没有谈判的打算
Sir, juma has no desire to negotiate anything.

170
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,076
他只图杀总统而后快
Hes going to kill the president.

171
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,073
阁下  我们的战术计划已经到位
Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.

172
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,019
我们会兵分两路
It's a two-pronged assault, and we're

173
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,040
肯定会杀朱玛一个措手不及
confident that it stands a good chance of catching juma off guard,

174
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,020
但时间不等人  现在必须开始行动
but we're losing time. We have to initiate now.

175
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,097
我不能授权可能会危及到
I cann authorize any action

176
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,064
总统生命的任何行动
At might result in the president's death.

177
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,063
继续想办法和朱玛对话
Keep trying to open dialogue with juma.

178
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:09,037
在他变卦前不许轻举妄动
hold your position until he told otherwise.

179
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,011
我会开着视频
I will keep this feed open.

180
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:13,094
"朱玛将军表明

准备好

杰克  听我说

朱玛不是单独行动的
Juma's not solely coordinating this attack.

185
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,022
什么意思
What do you mean?

186
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,052
我听见了他用卫星电话
I heard him talking on his sat phone.

187
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,072
和外面的人里应外合
He's coordinating with someone on the outside.

188
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,036
他们给朱玛实时情报
They were giving him real-time intel.

189
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,013
你认为那些是白宫内部人员吗
You think it's someone in the white house?

190
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,079
我不知道
I don't know.

191
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,083
但是就算我们制服朱玛
But even if we take juma down,

192
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,097
总统还是处在危险之中
The president may still be in danger.

193
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,050
你是我知道的
You're the only one I know

194
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,080
唯一一个可以做这件事的人  杰克
Who can do this, jack.

195
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,054
查出朱玛的同党是谁
Find out who juma's working with.

196
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,032
莫斯探员  白宫西翼发生了爆炸

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,065
如果情报不可靠他是不会信口开河的
He wouldn't have told me unless he were sure.

304
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,097
现在唯一的线索就是莱恩·伯内特
And right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.

305
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:02,007
他知道这次袭击是在白宫
He knew about the attack

306
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,051
他很有可能知道
On the white house, and chances are,

307
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,041
和朱玛通话的人是何方神圣
He's gonna know who juma was talking to.

308
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,098
好吧  好吧  我会和他谈谈这件事的
All right, all right, i'll talk to him.

309
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,061
不  总统已准备赦免他了
No, the president already offered him immunity.

310
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,088
他拒绝了
He turned it down.

311
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,052
他什么都不会告诉你
He's not gonna tell you anything,

312
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,075
但我能令他开口
But he will talk to me.

313
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,002
为什么  你难道又要给他用刑吗
Why is that, jack, 'cause you tortured him?

314
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,096
我不需要碰他  只要让他放明白点
I don't need to touch him. i just need him to think

315
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,019
我是不会善罢甘休的
I'm there to finish what i started.

316
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:21,039
我向你保证
And i promise you

317
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,009
他会对我们和盘托出
He will tell us everything we need to know.

318
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,073
拉里  拜托了
Larry, please,

319
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,086
这是比尔死前最后的遗愿
The last thing bill asked for before he died

320
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:30,067
他希望我能战斗到底  这是我欠他的
Was for me to follow this through. I owe him that.

321
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,054
我向你保证
Look, i give you my word.

322
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,084
我不会动伯内特一根汗毛
I will not touch burnett.

323
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,014
杰克  听着  我理解你的朋友
Jack, look, i understand about your friend,

324
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,061
真的  但总统命令我羁押你
I do, but i got standing orders from the president to take you into custody.

325
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:40,014
我必须得带你回调查局
I gotta get you back to fbi,

326
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,055
但我保证会调查的  好吗
But i promise you i'll look into this, all right?

327
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,055
鲍威尔探员  给鲍尔戴上手铐
Agent powell, handcuff mr. bauer.

328
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,078
带他去2号集结地
Take him down to staging area b.

329
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,022
先生  请把双手放到脑后
Sir, put your hands on top of your head.

330
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:49,075
-拉里  -如果你只想说他是对的
- Larry...  - if you're gonna tell me he's right about this

331
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,045
我不想听
I don't want to hear it.

332
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,038
这就是问题所在
Yes, that's the problem. you're not

333
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,012
你根本听不进他说的话
listening to what he said

334
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,062
你能不能别为他辩护了
When are you gonna stop defending this guy?

335
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:55,096
我不是在维护他
I'm not defending him,

336
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,079
我是觉得他说的是对的
I'm defending a good idea.

337
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:59,049
我说了我会调查的
I just said i will look into this!

干你的活儿  把这栋楼封锁起来

我要见总统  是紧急情况

-她们都安然无恙  -感谢上帝
- And they're in good condition.  - thank god.

349
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,040
我要尽快会见秘书处

350
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,007
和参谋长联席会议成员
And the joint chiefs as soon as possible.

351
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,006
除了总统那  白宫其他地方的通讯
We're routing all white house

352
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,007
正在恢复中
communications except the president

353
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,091
我们还建立了个临时指挥所
And we're setting up a temporary command post.

354
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,047
好
Good.

355
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,031
卡宁先生  我有事找你
Mr. kanin, i need to speak with you.

356
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,001
我要去见总统
I'm on my way to see the president.

357
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,095
我知道  但事情特别紧急
Yes, i know, sir, but it's extremely urgent.

358
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,048
只要耽搁您一会
It'll only take a few moments.

359
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,012
好吧
All right.

360
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,029
怎么了  沃克探员
What is it, agent walker?

361
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,075
我们注意到一些新的情报
Some new intel has just come to our attention

362
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:58,022
需要立即做出反应
And we need to act on it immediately.

363
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,092
我想找总统  但被挡住了
I tried to reach the president, but i couldn't get through.

364
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,041
-愿闻其详  -长官  对总统的威胁
- I'm listening.  - sir, the threat to

365
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,069
还没完全解除
the president may not be over.

366
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:05,096
我们有理由相信  朱玛背后有人撑腰
We've reason to believe that general juma was not acting alone.

367
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,040
比尔·布坎南死前
Before bill buchanan died,

368
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,073
他看到朱玛和某人用卫星电话联络
He saw general juma communicating With someone on a sat phone.

369
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,024
现在  我们能确定
At this point, we can confirm

370
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,037
调查局探员刚进入白宫
That fbi agents entered the white house moments ago,

371
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:21,034
有报告称听到持续的枪声
And there were reports of sustained gunfire.

372
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,065
看上去当局已经控制了白宫西翼
It appears that authorities are now in control of the west wing,

373
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:29,012
我们还在等待调查局有关人质的消息
And we are expecting word from our fbi source Of the status of the hostages.

374
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,075
目前没有任何官方的消息
While there has been no official comment...

375
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,092
有什么消息
So what have we got?

376
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,042
总统还活着
The president's alive.

377
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,013
你确定吗
Are you sure?

378
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,066
我们同时监视着不同部门的服务器
We've been monitoring interagency servers.

379
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:43,013
消息传出来   朱玛死了  泰勒还活着
Word just went out. juma's dead, taylor survived.

380
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,010
你猜发生什么了
What happened do you think?

381
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,057
细节还不清楚
We don't know any details yet,

382
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:51,061
但我们会继续监视的
But we'll keep monitoring.

383
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:57,045
你得佩服下那婊子
Well... you gotta admire the damn bitch.

384
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,015
她不会轻言放弃
She doesn't give up easily.

385
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,055
对不起  长官  我们
I'm sorry, sir. we, uh,

386
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:03,089
没能完全控制局面
Just didn't have enough control over the situation.

387
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:06,036
格雷格  你看上去很紧张
Greg, you look tense.

388
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,017
帮帮忙
Do me a favor.

389
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,028
喝点酒  放松下
Have a drink, relax.

390
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,075
朱玛遵守了诺言
Juma held up his part of the bargain.

391
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,025
我们的目的都达到了
We're getting what we wanted.

392
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:25,035
就我而言  一切还尽在掌握
As far as i'm concerned, everything's still on track.

393
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,086
武器在哪了
Where are the weapons now?

394
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:34,010
几个小时后我们就可以卸货了
A shipment should ready for pickup in the next couple of hours.

395
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,063
好  给查普曼打电话
Good. get chapman on the phone.

396
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,087
我想确定几个目标
I want to nail down some targets.

397
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,076
长官  你要的直升机已经过来了

398
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,016
10分钟内到
It'll be here in ten minutes.

399
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,076
你们要护送鲍尔回调查局
You'll be escorting Mr Bauer back to the FBI.

400
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,003
把他关在指挥中心
Hold him in the command center.

401
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,023
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,017
我是拉里 ·莫斯
This is larry moss.

403
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,043
我是伊桑·卡宁  我听说
This is ethan kanin. i understand

404
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,054
你要把杰克·鲍尔押回调查局
You're taking jack bauer back to fbi?

405
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,004
是的  长官  他将被审讯

406
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,067
并被遣送回联邦调查局候审
And remanded into federal custody.

407
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:16,037
我希望你能暂缓执行
I want you to put that on hold.

408
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,038
怎么了
Sir?

409
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,054
我刚和沃克探员谈过
I just spoke with agent walker.

410
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,065
她告诉我朱玛可能和别人
She told me juma may have been working with someone

411
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:23,045
暗中勾结  而且有可能
On the outside, and that there may be

412
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,009
还有对总统的其他威胁
An ongoing threat to the president.

413
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,059
是的
Yes, that's true.

414
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:32,005
我希望你能让杰克·鲍尔
I want you to send jack bauer

415
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,083
去审讯莱恩·伯内特
to question ryan burnett.

416
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,080
莫斯探员
Agent moss?

417
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,076
长官  我觉得那样不好
Sir, i think that's a mistake.

418
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,005
沃克探员和我说了你的顾忌
Yes, agent walker shared your concerns with me,

419
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,027
我也经过了深思熟虑
And i've given this some thought.

420
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:46,011
如果伯内特确实知道朱玛的同伙是谁
If burnett does know who juma was working with,

421
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:47,060
鲍尔的手段可能会是
Bauer's approach may be our best

422
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,007
得到情报的最好机会
chance to get that information

423
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,004
恕我直言  长官  鲍尔差点杀了他
With respect, sir, bauer almost killed this man.

424
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,085
我当时在现场  莫斯探员
I was there, agent moss,

425
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:56,055
但这次审讯是可以控制的
But this will be a controlled interrogation.

426
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,075
我们利用伯内特对鲍尔的恐惧心理
We're gonna play on burnett's fears.

427
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:01,025
鲍尔只要单独现身
Bauer's presence alone should be enough

428
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,035
就足够让他开口了
To intimidate him into talking.

429
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,072
长官  鲍尔是个不确定因素
Sir, bauer is a wild card.

430
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,016
他进屋见到伯内特之后
We have no idea what he'll do

431
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,052
不知道他会做出什么来
When he gets in that room with burnett.

432
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,013
我考虑到这事会有风险
I realize there's a risk.

433
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,040
所以此事得由我全权负责
That's why you're going to do this under my authority And my authority alone.

434
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,067
你不和总统说这事吗
You're not taking this to the president?

435
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,014
不  如有意外
No. if something does go wrong,

436
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,027
我希望总统不受牵连
I want to make sure the president is protected.

437
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,061
恕我直言  我觉得你不告诉总统
With respect, sir, i think you're not telling the president

438
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,078
是因为你知道她决不会批准
'cause you know she'd never allow this.

439
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,001
你的异议我清楚了  莫斯探员
You've made your objections clear, agent moss.

440
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,058
我们不要再争论此事了
I'm not going to debate this with you.

441
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:32,032
我让你带鲍尔去审讯伯内特
I want you to take bauer to question burnett.

442
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,009
这是命令  你明白吗
That's a direct order. do you understand?

443
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:36,039
明白
I understand.

444
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,076
我希望你能对此次审讯全程监控
And i'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation.

445
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,009
我期待事成之后  你能有份完整报告
I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done.

446
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,013
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

447
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:54,061
我希望能够亲自和死者家属谈话
I want to speak personally to the families of everyone we lost tonight, so...

448
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,094
通知到他们后和我说一声
Keep me informed as they're notified.

449
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,044
没问题  总统阁下
Absolutely, madam president.

450
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,081
安吉拉·纳尔逊到的时候
And the minute angela nelson

451
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,045
直接带她来见我
Gets here, send her straight up to me.

452
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:06,012
需要准备对全国民众的讲话稿
We need to start working on the speech to the country.

453
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,065
当然  总统阁下
Of course, madam president.

454
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,046
帕特里克

455
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:16,036
你刚经历了一场严酷的考验
You have just been through a terrible ordeal.

456
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,063
你确定没事吗
Are you sure you're okay?

457
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,020
我没事的
I'll be fine.

458
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,054
这事对专心工作有帮助
It helps to focus on work.

459
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
我理解
I understand.

460
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:31,031
谢谢你  帕特里克
Thank you, patrick.

461
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,015
感谢上帝你没事
Thank god you're all right.

462
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,046
你感觉如何
How you feeling?

463
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:47,099
仿佛刚从噩梦中醒来
Like i just woke up from a nightmare.

464
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:50,003
真难以置信  伊桑
It was unbelievable, ethan.

465
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,070
确实不堪回想  奥利维亚还好吗
I can't even imagine it. how's olivia?

466
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:55,063
她被吓到了  但会好起来的
She's shaken up, but she's going to be okay.

467
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,020
听到这我很欣慰
I'm glad to hear it.

468
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:59,030
伊桑  今晚我们牺牲了很多好战友
We lost some good people tonight, ethan.

469
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:02,001
要竭尽所能多方寻求帮手
We're going to need all the help we can get.

470
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:05,048
我考虑让奥利维亚加入进来
I'm thinking about bringing olivia on

471
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:08,045
担任特别顾问
As a special advisor.

472
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:09,098
总统阁下
Madam president,

473
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,055
经过此次事件  您不愿与女儿分开
I can understand your not wanting to be separated

474
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,032
这我能理解
From your daughter after what's happened.

475
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,012
正是因为发生了这次事件
Especially after what's happened,

476
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,046
我们需要有能力的人加入
We need people who can do the job.

477
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,042
我对奥利维亚的能力无可置疑
I'm not disputing olivia's competence,

478
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,076
但她也是个政治负担
but she's also a political Liability.

479
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,043
大选时她的所为大家都还历历在目
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign,

480
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,073
她对媒体散布谣言
Leaking damaging personal information

481
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,033
诽谤您的竞选对手
About your opponent to the press.

482
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,034
奥利维亚知错了
Olivia knows what she did was wrong.

483
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,077
她差点毁掉您的竞选
She almost cost you the election.

484
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:34,027
她已经变了
She's changed.

485
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:36,071
伊桑  我们有谈过此事
We talked about it, ethan,

486
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:38,094
她也表示自己将负全责
And she is accepting full responsibility.

487
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,088
她已经吸取教训了
She has learned from her mistakes.

488
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:45,062
我希望忘掉过去的种种  放眼未来
I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead.

489
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:47,002
我还是认为此事不妥
I still think it's a mistake.

490
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,012
我不在乎你怎么认为
I don't care what you think!

491
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:58,020
抱歉 伊桑
I am so sorry, ethan.

492
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,067
你知道我也不想这样
You know i don't mean that.

493
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,044
但我意已决
But i've made up my mind.

494
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,064
我要奥利维亚加入我的幕僚之中
I want olivia to join my administration.

495
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,001
并且我希望由你来发起
And i want it to come from you.

496
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,081
我
Me?

497
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:13,011
由你亲自任命她职务
Your offering her this position

498
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,058
能有助于你们俩化干戈为玉帛
Would be a good way to extend an olive branch.

499
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:21,069
我要你们俩相安无事
I need the two of you to make peace.

500
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,076
遵命  总统阁下
All right, madam president.

501
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:27,043
我会和她谈的
I'll talk to her.

502
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,079
谢谢你  伊桑
Thank you, ethan.

503
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:33,050
我听说沃克探员之前找我
I understand agent walker was trying to reach me.

504
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,043
对  我联系了她
That's right, but i spoke to her.

505
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,010
她有何事
What did she want?

506
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,070
这是一些琐碎公事  总统阁下
Just some procedural matters, madam president.

507
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,041
我已处理了
I took care of it.

508
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,067
拉里  你找我吗
Larry, you wanted to see me?

509
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:19,031
我刚接到伊桑·卡宁的电话
I just got off the phone with ethan kanin.

510
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,065
听着  我不想背着你做事
Look, i didn't want to go behind your back,

511
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,095
但是是你让我没有选择余地的
But you didn't leave me any choice.

512
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,059
我不给你留余地吗
I didn't leave you a...?

513
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,046
你怎么就不能选择服从命令听指挥呢
How about you choose to follow orders?

514
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,019
我很抱歉  拉里
I'm sorry, larry.

515
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:33,066
不  我觉得你不会
No. i don't think you are.

516
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,000
拉里  今天我亲眼目睹了杰克的作为
Larry, i've seen jack do some terrible things today.

517
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,080
粗暴之极  我仍不敢苟同
Things that i still can't justify.

518
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:40,030
但结果却每次都证明他是对的
But he has been right every time.

519
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,080
知道吗  我不禁在想
And you know what? i can't help but think

520
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:43,030
如果我们能让他放手去干
That maybe if we had just stayed out of his way,

521
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:44,070
或许这些悲剧都不会发生
None of this would have happened.

522
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:47,064
听着  我很抱歉
Look, i am sorry

523
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,084
不该背着你做事
That i went behind your back,

524
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:51,008
但我向你保证  伯内特的处置方式
But i... i promise you this play with burnett

525
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,005
一定得按杰克的意思办
Will go down just the way jack says.

526
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,038
如果你觉得自己和杰克一条战线
If you think you're going with bauer,

527
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,065
那你一定是疯了
You are out of your mind.

528
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:00,019
就算你有能耐
You may have gotten

529
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,012
让白宫发令  可我仍是行动指挥
A white house order, but i'm still running this operation.

530
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,086
我会带杰克去见伯内特
I'll take bauer to see Burnett.

531
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:07,079
你回调查局
You're going back to fbi.

532
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:10,090
我会把你扫地出门
I want you to clean out your office

533
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,056
并收回你的联邦探员徽章
And hand in your badge.

534
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:15,023
我要将你无限期停职
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

535
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,080
好吧  我知道你很不爽  但事情还没完
Okay. i know that you're upset larry, but this isn't over.

536
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,000
你仍然需要我
You're going to need me.

537
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:21,021
我需要的是能让我信任的人
What i need are people that i can trust.

538
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,024
我原以为你就是
I thought that was you.

539
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,090
听好了  你别以为自己得偿所愿了
Look, you may think you got what you wanted,

540
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,047
让蕾妮背着我行事
Getting renee to go behind my back,

541
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:54,021
但伊桑命令我  让你去审问伯内特
But ethan kanin ordered me to let you question burnett.

542
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,051
你审问时  我都会全程死死盯住你
I'm going to be watching you every second you're in there.

543
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:58,018
你胆敢让我不爽  你就死定了
You do one thing i don't like, you're finished.

544
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,065
-听懂了吗  -明白
You understand me? understood.

545
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,088
你不该因此牵连蕾妮
You should leave renee out of this.

546
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:07,025
她也只是做自己认为对的事情
She was just doing what she thought was right.

547
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:09,019
是吗  她可能会因此丢了饭碗
Yeah? well, she may lose her job over it.

548
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,089
她是你手下最棒的探员
She's the best agent you've got.

549
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,022
她无视我的权威
She circumvented my authority.

550
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,043
对此我不能置之不理
I can't just ignore that.

551
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,033
我认识她9年了
I've known this woman for nine years,

552
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,030
从未见过她做事会像
And i've never seen her do the kind of things she's done

553
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,093
过去9小时所做的那样
In the last nine hours.

554
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:48,018
我们已将目标缩小到 12个东部沿海城市
We've narrowed the list down To 12 targets along the eastern seaboard.

555
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,021
都在发射基地300公里半径范围以内
They're all within 300 kilometers of the base.

556
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,055
有多少人
How many people?

557
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,075
每个目标区大概1至1.5万人
10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone.

558
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:55,006
死亡率估计会是多少
And our kill ratio would be what?

559
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:56,040
我们选择的城市
Well, we've chosen these areas

560
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,072
都是人口密度最高的
for maximum population density

561
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,096
按此估算估计高达80%
So the ratio could be as high as 80%.

562
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,020
希望我们永远都不必真去确证这个结果
Let's hope we never have to find out.

563
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:04,097
把这些坐标传到战术行动组去
Get these coordinates down to the boys in tac-ops.

564
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,013
-让他们运作起来  -遵命  长官
Have them start programming them in. Yes, sir.

565
00:28:13,014 --> 00:28:16,054
我们刚拦截到调查局的一条信息
We just intercepted a flash memo from the fbi.

566
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:20,028
杰克·鲍尔正在去肯尼迪纪念医院的路上
Jack bauer is on his way to kennedy memorial hospital

567
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,078
准备去审问伯内特
To question burnett.

568
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:24,058
鲍尔已被拘捕了  怎么可能还去审问
Bauer was arrested. how is this possible?

569
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,022
白宫下达了总统行政命令
There was an executive order from the white house

570
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,042
让鲍尔有权审问伯内特
Giving bauer access to burnett.

571
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,056
鲍尔是不到黄河心不死的
Bauer will finish what he started.

572
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,016
伯内特早晚会和盘托出
Burnett will tell him everything.

573
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,029
不  长官  他不会的
No, he won't, sir.

574
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:36,083
我已派人去医院干掉伯内特
I have already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with burnett.

575
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,063
到时候将一并干掉鲍尔
He can take care of bauer at the same time.

576
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,017
你派谁去的
Who did you send?

577
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,067
奎恩
Quinn.

578
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,097
奎恩身手不错
Oh. quinn's good.

579
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:47,061
鲍尔也不好对付
Bauer's good, too.

580
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:50,058
莫斯探员  我们已经封锁了整个楼层
Agent moss, we've locked down the entire floor.

581
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,068
在伯内特房间
We equipped burnett's room

582
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,065
我们安装了两组监视器和窃听器
With two cameras and audio surveillance.

583
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,078
他在哪
Where is he?

584
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:56,002
大厅尽头
Down the hall.

585
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,048
稍等一会
It's going to be a moment.

586
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:58,062
大夫要让他苏醒过来
Doctor has to revive him.

587
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,062
为什么  发生什么事了
Why? what happened?

588
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,042
我们给他注射了强效镇定剂
He was given a heavy sedative.

589
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,076
刚到时他情况很糟糕
He was in pretty bad shape when he got here.

590
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:05,089
温顿大夫  联邦探员拉里·莫斯
Dr. wyndam, special agent Larry moss,

591
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,079
杰克·鲍尔
jack bauer.

592
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:07,099
我知道你们到这
I understand youe here

593
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,016
-是要审问我的病人  -没错
To interrogate my patient. that's right.

594
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,083
上次审问后  目前他仍处在恢复状态
Well, he's still recovering from his last Interrogation,

595
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,047
所以  如果你们又要来虐待他
so if you're here to brutalize him again,

596

政府遭受了巨大的损失
This administration has just suffered some terrible losses,

656
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,018
我们需要你的帮助
And we need help.

657
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:04,085
总统和我想让你加入内阁
The president and i would like you to consider coming on board

担任总统的特别顾问
As special advisor to the president.

659
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,052
我
I, uh...

660
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:15,026
不得不承认  我有点吃惊
I have to say i'm a little surprised.

661
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:17,066
-吃惊  -我是说  竟是你正式批准的
- Surprised? - oh, that you'd sign off on this.

662
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:21,030
你妈妈说已决定冰释前嫌
You mother said she's ready to put the past behind her...

663
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,037
我也会这么做
And so am i.

664
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,075
竞选的时候  我做事过于激进
I overstepped my bounds in the campaign

665
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:29,014
我大错特错了
and i was wrong.

666
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,018
你能认识到这点  太好了
I'm glad you see it that way.

667
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:33,081
但是让我困扰的不是过去  伊桑
But it's not the past that concerns me, ethan.

668
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:36,008
而是现在发生的一切
It's what's happening right now,

669
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,085
是从我妈妈接管政府以后  发生的一切
And what's been happening ever since my mother took office.

670
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:42,009
你什么意思
Excuse me?

671
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,082
如果有个称职的首席顾问
Do you think any of this would have happened

672
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,046
你觉得这一切的一切
If my mother had a chief advisor

673
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:48,053
还会发生吗
Who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?

674
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,090
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

675
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:52,077
整个政府上下都被腐化了
Her government was corrupted on every level,

676
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,080
而这一切居然就在你的眼皮底下发生
And it all happened right under your nose.

677
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:59,034
即使你自己也觉得这种失败让你良心不安
Even you have to admit, it's an unconscionable failure on your part.

678
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:03,008
坦白地说
Frankly, i'm surprised

679
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:04,091
我不明白为什么你还不辞职
You haven't tendered your resignation.

680
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:08,081
你这样对我说话太放肆了
You have no right to speak to me that way.

681
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:11,065
说话要实事求是
You don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,049
你有证据吗
You don't have the facts.

683
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,079
我正要找证据呢
I intend to get the facts.

684
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:19,093
我会找出是谁辜负了我妈妈
I'm going to find out exactly who failed my mother,

685
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:24,066
我会确保让他再也坐不回原来的位置
And i am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again.

686
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:29,007
失陪
Excuse me.

687
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,043
好  进去吧
Okay, let's go.

688
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,073
我会在这盯着你的
I'll be watching.

689
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,070
你动他一根汗毛  就别想再继续了
You lay one finger on him, it's over.

690
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:02,071
好
Right.

691
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,027
他恢复知觉了
He's coming around.

692
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:32,034

00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:11,017
你来这干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

698

我刚从白宫赶过来啊

朱玛的阴谋破产了
Juma's attack failed.

700
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:17,031
他跟他的同党都死翘翘了

你不能这么做  你无权这么做

这样便神不知鬼不觉了
So, nobody will know That we were involved.

749
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,019
妙计
Good.

750
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,053
那当然

我没有杀伯内特
I didn't kill burnett.

756
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:34,084
-我是被陷害的  -陷害
- i'm being set up. - set up?

757
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,042
有人在屋里释放了神经毒气
A man released some kind of nerve agent into the room.

758
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,067
让我动弹不得

他从天花板上下来  杀了伯内特

你知道我不能回去的

如果你是清白的  你就可以回来

764
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:47,057
他们这样陷害我  而不杀我
Look, there is a reason why they

765
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:49,005
其中定有隐情
wanted me framed and didn't kill me

766
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:51,019
这样就能利用我来让你分心
They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with me

767
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,086
他们好趁机继续不可告人的秘密
So they can finish what they started.

768
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,046
别让他们侥幸成功

恐怖袭击还没有结束
