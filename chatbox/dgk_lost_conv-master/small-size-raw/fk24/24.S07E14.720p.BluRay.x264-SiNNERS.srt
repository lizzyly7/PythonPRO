我跑到安全屋那儿

那儿有5个装有甲烷的罐子

只要一个流弹就够了

朱玛一伙还有同党

现在唯一的线索就是莱恩·伯内特

他知道这次袭击的目标是白宫

我不计较过去

称职的首席顾问  你觉得

听着  我不想背着你做事

35
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,003
你给我回办公室收拾铺盖卷儿

你动他一根汗毛  就别想再继续了

鲍尔从联邦调查局跑了
Bauer got away from the fbi.

158
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,065
怎么回事
How?

159

鲍尔是名身手不凡的探员

160
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,089
这点不用你来提醒我
You don't have to tell me that.

161
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,079
联邦调查局正在全力抓捕他
But the fbi has launched a major effort to apprehend him.

162
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,006
他撑不了多久的
He won't be able to avoid them for long.

163
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,023

是的  先生
Yes,sir.

166
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,020
如果鲍尔把我们和朱玛联系上
If bauer connects us to juma,

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,035
会严重阻碍这次行动
It could seriously impede this operation.

00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,084
没错

169

那就没问题了
Then I don't foresee a problem.

172
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,085
一旦武器部署到位
Once the weapons are deployed,

173
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:48,048
鲍尔和其他人知道与否就无关紧要了
Then it doesn't matter what mr. bauer or anyone else knows.

174
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,042
还有问题吗
Something wrong?

175
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,002

No,sir.

176
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,003
西顿先生  想到这么多人会命丧我手
Mr. seaton,I get no pleasure

177
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:03,083
我也深感内疚和痛苦
From the knowledge that people will die at our hands.

178
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,087
死去的每一个人  对我来说都是一场悲剧
One single soul,the loss of one soul is tragic to me,

179
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,027
更别说是这么大的一个伤亡数字
Let alone the numbers we're talking about!

180
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:12,031
但你不要忘了

00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,054
任何战争都会有附带伤亡的
Worth fighting involves collateral damage.

182
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:16,034
而且我们现在做的事
And what we're doing

183
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,075
从根本意义上来说是绝对必要的
Is fundamentally and absolutely necessary!

184
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,075
我希望你清楚这点
And I know you understand that!

00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,045
当然

告诉他们带上睡衣和牙刷

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,057
今夜会很漫长

196
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,069
国防部的顾问公司吗

00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,013
是的  他们开始只是搞咨询服务
Uh,yeah,they started out as consultants,

198
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,003
但在过去你身处异国他乡的几年里

199
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,063
五角大楼外包了许多

人力资源输出

203
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,073
斯塔克伍德公司本质上就是一支私人军队
Starkwood's basically a private army.

204
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,044
他们从世界各地

招募了许多退役士兵和反恐特警

206
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:19,011
雇佣他们组成军事安保小组
Then they hire them back to the military security teams.

207
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:21,098
成千上万的特警驻扎在国内外

斯塔克伍德和朱玛是一伙的吗

209
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:25,031
即使是  也根本无案可查

210
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,035
但若有人知情  就一定是迈尔参议员
But,you know,if anyone knows,it's senator mayer.

211
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,079
为什么是他

解散了反恐小组之后

213

他又开始了一系列的调查

指控的罪名是什么

听证会是保密的
The hearings are classified,but

217
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:41,010
但想必迈尔该有足够的证据搞垮他们

218
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,073
好的  我现在就去找他谈

能否查下紧急事件反应小组的记录

288
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,081
在白宫遇袭之后
Just after the attack on the white house,

289
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,024
杰克·鲍尔提供了
Jack bauer came forward

290
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,085
一个令人堪忧的情报
With a disturbing claim.

291
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,055
他说还有一些涉案人员
He said there were people

292
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,042
仍然逍遥法外
Still at large who were involved in the conspiracy--

鲍尔有证据吗

00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,086
没有确凿的证据

但他认为莱恩·伯内特

是我们找出这些人的最佳机会

299
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:39,080
鲍尔要求我授权去审讯他

300
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,090
情况本该在掌控之中

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,057
本打算设计让他威胁伯内特如实招供

302
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:53,031
所以我同意了鲍尔的请求
So,I granted bauer's request.

303
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,045
但我铸成了大错
It was a terrible mistake.

304
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,079
伊桑  发生什么事了
What happened,ethan?

305
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,049
伯内特死了
Burnett is dead.

306
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,026
天哪
My god...

307
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:06,026
证据表明  他是被鲍尔所杀
The evidence suggests that he was killed by bauer.

308
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,006
我不相信
I don't believe it!

309
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:11,016
他声称参与这次阴谋的另有其人
His claim of another party being involved in the attacks

310
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,017
这话看起来是一个谎言
Appear to have been a fabrication.

311
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,057
谎言
A fabrication.

312
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:17,014
这可能与比尔·布坎南的死有关
It may have something to do with bill buchanan's death;

313
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,047
没人知道
No one knows.

314
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,084
但是总统阁下
But madam president,

315
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,024
我将对我的行为承担全部责任
I take full responsibility.

316
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:24,039
我试图不告诉您是因为
I was trying to insulate you.

317
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,098
万一出了岔子  您可以推诿说不知情
To provide you with deniability in case anything went wrong.

318
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:30,052
或是因为你认为总统会反对你的做法吧
Or was it because you thought the president would say no?

319
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,062
奥利维亚
Olivia.

320
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,086
鲍尔现在在哪里
Where is bauer now?

321
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,039
依旧在逃
At large.

322
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,043
调查局正全力追捕他
The fbi is devoting its full resources to the manhunt.

323
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,036
一旦找到他  马上向我汇报
Let me know the minute they find him.

324
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:46,027
好的  阁下
Yes,ma'am.

325
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,087
总统阁下
Madam president...

326
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,064
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,029
看起来东西都齐了
Looks like everything.

328
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,083
她要走了
She's on the move.

329
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,041
鲍尔在哪里
Where's bauer?

330
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,064
我不知道
I don't know.

331
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,068
不要对我撒谎
Don't you lie to me.

332
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,038
我们追踪到你给一个
We traced two calls from your cell

333
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,088
挂失的手机打了两通电话
To a phone that was reported stolen.

334
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,085
我们也查出你进入了政府机密数据库
And we know you accessed a classified government database

335
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,052
还把某人的姓名和地址发给鲍尔
And sent someone's name and address to bauer.

336
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:42,072
蕾妮  这样一来你成了事后从犯了
Renee,that makes you an accessory after the fact.

337
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,093
告诉我他在哪
Now tell me where he is.

338
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,076
我做不到
I can't.

339
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,090
-该死  -我还是不信是他干的
- Damn it! - I still don't believe that he did this.

340
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,023
那解释下他为什么不自首
Then explain to me why he's not turning himself in,

341
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:54,050
让我们帮他找到那莫须有的第三方
And letting us help him find this mysterious third party.

342
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,007
因为他被陷害而且他不相信
Because he was framed and he doesn't trust

343
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,044
我们能为他洗脱罪名
Our ability to work through it.

344
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,031
在我们对他那般地不公后
And,you know,after what we've put him through,

345
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,034
我们怎能再责备他呢
How can you blame him?

346
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:05,031
你真愿为保全他而牺牲一切吗
You're actually willing to sacrifice everything to protect him.

347
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,008
杰克找到证据后  他会给我们打电话的
Once jack finds the evidence,he will call us.

348
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:13,059
詹尼斯在破译你发出的信息
You know,janis is decrpyting what you sent.

349
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,059
用不了多久
It's not going to take her a long time.

350
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,006
我们就会找到他的
We are going to find him.

351
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,076
蕾妮  告诉我你发的是谁的资料
Renee,tell me whose information you sent.

352
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:22,095
我会告诉司法部长  你很合作
I'll let the A.G. know that you're cooperating.

353
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,023
抱歉  拉里
I'm sorry,larry.

354
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:28,077
把她关起来
Put her in holding.

355
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:31,060
告知她所享有的合法权利
Mirandize her.

356
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,076
晚安  先生
Good night,sir.

357
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:55,039
明早见
See you in the morning.

358
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:46,078
有人吗
Hello?

359
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,069
把你的手放在我看得到的地方   参议员
Keep your hands where i can see them,senator.

360
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,049
鲍尔
Bauer.

361
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,072
坐下
Take a seat.

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,083
我知道你对莱恩·伯内特都做了什么
I know what you did to ryan burnett.

363
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,057
我不会让你那样杀了我的
I'm not going to let you butcher me like you did him.

364
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:10,084
你想我死的话  鲍尔
You want me dead,bauer,

365
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,047
那你就在这动手吧
You'll have to kill me where i stand.

366
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,094
参议员  如果我想杀你 你早就死了
If i wanted to kill you,senator, You'd be dead already.

367
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,074
给我坐下
Now take a seat!

368
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,026
你真让人费解  鲍尔
You're a real enigma,bauer.

369
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,036
在你把总统从恐怖分子魔掌中救出的1小时后
An hour after you save the president from terrorists,

370
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,086
你却残忍地杀害了一名联邦证人
You murder a federal witness in cold blood.

371
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,070
我没杀伯内特
I didn't kill burnett.

372
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,007
是他干的
This man did.

373
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,057
你知道他是谁吗
Do you know who he is?

374
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,067
不知道
No.

375
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,034
他叫约翰·奎恩
His name is john quinn.

376
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,084
他为斯塔克伍德公司卖命
He works for starkwood.

377
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,067
这和斯塔克伍德公司有什么联系
What in the world does starkwood have to do with this?

378
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,084
我还不清楚
I don't know yet.

379
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,086
但我知道他们派人杀了伯内特
But i do know they sent someone to kill burnett

380
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,026
并陷害我来掩盖他们
And frame me to cover up their involvement

381
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,077
今天所策划的一切阴谋诡计
In everything that's happened today,

382
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,061
包括这次对白宫的袭击
Including the attack on the white house.

383
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:58,042
鲍尔  这简直是天方夜谭
That's a hell of a theory,bauer.

384
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,079
但如果你妄想以此洗脱罪名的话
But you'll have to spin a better story than that

385
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,062
那你还得给我编个更好的故事吧
If you expect it to get you off the hook.

386
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,056
参议员  我不是来为自己证明清白的
Senator,i did not come here to clear my name.

387
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,039
我只想搞清楚
I'm trying to understand

388
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,056
朱玛和斯塔克伍德之间的联系
The connection between juma and starkwood.

389
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,073
没有任何联系
There isn't one.

390
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:16,070
我花了6个月的时间来调查斯塔克伍德
I've spent the better part of six months investigating starkwood.

391
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,066
如果和朱玛或桑加拉有关的话
If there was a connection to juma or sangala,

392
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,047
我早就知道了
I would know it.

393
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,078
我想看下你们所有相关的调查文件
I want to see every file you have concerning that investigation.

394
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,064
听着
Look...

395
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,068
斯塔克伍德公司纵容其安保队
Starkwood has let their security teams run amok

396
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:33,049
在全世界胡作非为  却坐视不管
All over the world,with no oversight.

397
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,012
他们试图以贿赂取得大项目的订单
They've bribed their way into large contracts,

398
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:38,027
他们试图干涉外交政策来为己所用
They've tried to influence foreign policy to their own benefit--

399
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,043
这就是为什么这个国家不该把军事行动
all good reasons Why this country should not be outsourcing

400
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:45,063
外包给私人企业的原因
Its military operations to private corporations.

401
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:49,067
我会让他们关门大吉的
And i am going to shut them down.

402
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:53,011
但没有任何证据表明
But there is nothing to remotely suggest

403
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,051
他们和本次针对祖国的恐怖袭击有牵连
They'd be involved in terrorist attacks on their own country

404
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:58,038
他们绝不会为钱出卖国家
For any amount of money.

405
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,095
他们帮助朱玛可能另有所图
Maybe they have different reasons for helping juma.

406
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,055
图什么
Like what?

407
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,005
我不知道
I don't know.

408
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,029
先生  我相信这个国家还会受到攻击
Sir,i believe this country is still under attack,

409
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,082
而这一切一定有一个合理的解释
And there has to be a reason.

410
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:11,092
难道我该相信一个绑架我的人的鬼话吗
And i'm supposed to believe this, coming from a man who's holding me hostage?

411
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,083
我要查看那些文件
I need access to those files.

412
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:22,030
如果朱玛和斯塔克伍德之间没有牵连
And if the connection Between juma and starkwood isn't there,

413
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,060
你愿意自首吗
Will you turn yourself in,then?

414
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,008
打开文件  先生
Just open the files,sir.

415
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:48,086
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

416
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,098
总统今晚会发表一个简短的讲话
The president will be making a brief statement tonight.

417
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,010
祝你好运  妈

418
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,029
我相信你们会理解  基于今天发生的事件
I'm sure you'll understand, based on the events of today,

419
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,096
讲话后没有提问的环节
There will be no opportunity for follow-up questions.

420
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,033
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

421
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:05,061
总统阁下驾到
The president of the united states.

谢谢

424
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,002
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,082
亲爱的美国同胞们  约翰·亚当斯
My fellow americans,john adams,

426
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:33,016
第一位在白宫居住的总统
The first president to take up residence in the white house,

427
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,039
曾向上苍祈福
Once prayed for heaven to bestow

428
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
祈祷白宫永享太平
Its blessings on this place.

429
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
今晚  上天保佑  让我们从
Tonight,those blessings have seen us through

430
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:44,057
一群玩命之徒的袭击中化险为夷
A brutal attack by a desperate tyrant.

431
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:47,057
我们失去了朋友和所爱的人
We have lost friends and loved ones here,

432
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:50,027
但我们胜利了
But we have prevailed.

433
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,061
我已经命令执法机构
I have commanded law enforcement agencies,

434
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,071
突发事件处理部门及其反应小组
Emergency services and first responders

435
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,001
时刻准备着
To keep their deployment level...

436
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,035
卡宁先生  我是肯·德奥  CNB的记者
Mr. kanin,ken dellao,cnb.

437
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:01,015
你能否确认下我刚收到的一条消息
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information I received a short time ago?

438
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,085
肯  现在真不是时候
Ken,this is clearly not the time...

439
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:06,039
我想在今晚的报道中播出
Yeah,i'm,i'm going to be reporting in this evening's broadcast

440
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,036
一名叫杰克·鲍尔的前联邦探员

涉嫌谋杀了莱恩·伯内特

442
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:15,003

443
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:16,020
那些牺牲的生命...
The lives we lost...

444
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:17,050
你从哪听到的
Where did you get this?

445
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,044
这么说是真的了
So,it's true,then?

446
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:21,011
我没这么说
I'm not confirming anything.

447
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:24,061
我还会报道  是您授权释放了鲍尔

450
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,079
但他们夺不走我们的灵魂

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,062
没错  今天的袭击

453
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:41,022
卡宁先生
Mr. kanin.

454
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,053
我说过  无可奉告
I said no comment.

455
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:45,030
但美国绝不会那么轻易屈服
But america is not so easily broken.

456
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:49,053
我们在桑加拉的军事行动已大获全胜

457
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,095
此时此刻  我们的部队

已经控制了桑加拉

我们赢了

看来你又在耍老把戏了
I see you're back to your old tactics.

461
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:01,081
你把伯内特的死
You leaked the story of burnett's murder

462
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,035
还有我的介入都透露给了媒体
And my involvement to the press.

463
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:06,045
伊桑  我不知道你在说什么
Ethan,i don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,069
奥利维亚  别想抵赖了
Olivia,don't bother denying it.

465
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,010
知道我授权释放鲍尔的人屈指可数
I can count on one hand the number of people who knew i'd authorized bauer's release.

466
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:22,023
那么你的又一次判断失误
So another one of your errors in judgment

467
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:23,043
让你搬起石头砸了自己的脚
bites you on the ass.

468
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:26,097
你还妄想把责任推到我身上

469
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,080
你知道这么做的后果吗
Do you realize what you've done?

470
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,004
为了伤害我
In trying to hurt me,

471
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:34,028
你会严重地伤害你母亲
You'll have caused tremendous damage to your mother.

472
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:36,078
总统一向是公开反对
The president has gone on record

473
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,029
任何情况下的刑讯逼供的
That torture is unacceptable under any circumstances.

474
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,012
这事一旦曝光  看上去鲍尔
When this gets out,it will look like bauer was sent

475
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:45,019
就是被派去折磨犯人的
Exactly for that.

476
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,079
这将成为一场政治浩劫
It'll be a political disaster.

477
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,036
你这次玩过头了
You've gone too far this time.

478
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,036
我受够你的唠叨了
I'm not listening to you anymore.

479
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,006
我不会让你轻易得逞的
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

480
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,007
把你的手放开
Get your hands off me.

481
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:58,076
作为美国人  我们应该同舟共济
As americans, We should stand together

482
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:00,057
为我们的成就感到自豪

感谢那些今晚  在我们祖国大地上

我们的人民可以安然入睡了

因为自由的荣光仍在闪耀

488
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,053
没有  东北区域不见鲍尔的踪影
No,there's been no sign of bauer in the northeast sector,

489
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:27,020
把警戒线范围扩展到25英里标记处
So expand your cordon to the 25-mile mark.

490
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:29,027
做好支援首府警局的准备
And be prepared to back up metro.

491
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,097
我正叫他们在全城随机抽查过往车辆

我把蕾妮传给鲍尔的数据分离出来了

494
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:38,061
但文件标题后的内容我就进不去了

495
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,001
什么意思
What does that mean?

她把姓名地址都加密了
She encrypted the name and address she used,

497
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,045
我解不开
And i can't seem to crack it.

498
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,075
-解不开吗  -她用的是她的个人电脑
- You can't? - she used her personal computer.

499
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,022
这个加密非常复杂
This is very serious encryption.

500
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:50,086
-只有一些高手才能做到  -谁能
- I mean,there are some high-level people who can do it. - like who?

501

是的  他正等着见你呢

档案上显示他也是六级分析员
According to her file,he's a level-six analyst,too.

506
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:06,014
我不知道还要在这里待多久

没问题

你们凭什么关她
What the bloody hell are you holding her for?

514
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:33,000
妨碍公务  篡改证据

帮我们找到杰克·鲍尔

518
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,074

我很难相信
I find that hard to believe.

525
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,088
当前最重要的是

你妻子会因跟鲍尔串谋而被起诉

除非你帮我们找到他

528
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:57,082
奥布赖恩先生
Mr. o'brian,

我们判断杰克应该是去那了

但你太太的这个案子是铁证如山

你太太面临的是至少15年的监禁

他为什么这么做

因为过去的6个月以来

迈尔一直想让鲍尔在狱中度过余生

他训练有素  经验老道

但我的孩子跟婚姻是第一位的
But my child and my marriage comes first,

597
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,036
你也应该这么想
And it should for you,too.

598
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:22,086
克罗伊  你帮杰克够多了
Chloe,love,you've helped jack enough.

599
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:24,073
真的
You have.

600
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:30,040
你不能再自作主张牺牲自己了
And you can't go deciding to make this sacrifice on your own any more.

601
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,017
但他并没有干过他们说的那些事啊
But he didn't do what they're saying he did.

602
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,094
那么他被捕后可以再证明自己清白
Then he can prove that when they take him into custody.

603
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:38,091
那也要他们给他机会才行
If they give him the chance.

604
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:56,026
今早的听证会上
At the hearing this morning,

605
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:59,077
你说你对自己的所作所为无怨无悔
you said you had no regrets about what you've done.

606
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:03,074
但我看到的是一个极度悔恨的人
But what i saw was a man full of regret.

607
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:06,047
参议员  我当然有悔恨的事
Of course i have regrets,senator.

608
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,008
我悔恨失去了家庭
I regret losing my family.

609
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:15,008
我妻子被杀是因为我负责保护
My wife was murdered because i was responsible

610
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:19,048
戴维·帕默尔免遭刺杀
For protecting david palmer during an assassination attempt.

611
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,029
我的女儿现在甚至都不能看我一眼
My daughter can't even look at me.

612
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,026
每天  我都后悔瞥见的那一双双世人的眼睛
Every day,i regret looking into the eyes of men,women and children,

613
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,066
我深知  或许就在下一刻
Knowing that,any moment,

614
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,080
他们就会被当做牺牲品
Their lives might be deemed expendable

615
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
只为维护那更高的利益
In an effort to protect the greater good.

616
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,064
我后悔每一个造成
I regret every decision or mistake i might have made

617
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:41,051
无辜生命死亡的决定或错误
That resulted in the loss of a single innocent life.

618
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:44,068
但你知道我最后悔的是什么吗
But you know what i regret the most?

619
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:48,068
是这个世界还需要像我这样的人
Is that this world even needs people like me.

620
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:52,025
所以你觉得我会天真到去相信
So you think i'm naive to believe

621
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:54,059
我们要为一个更高的标准而战斗吗
We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard of combat?

622
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,059
我怎么想不重要  参议员
Doesn't even matter what i think,senator.

623
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,029
你只需要理解我工作的地方
You just need to understand where i work,

624
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,029
比你的国会要肮脏得多
Things get a lot messier than where you work on the hill.

625
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:07,037
鲍尔  你遭受的那些是个悲剧
What you've lost,mr. bauer,is tragic.

626
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,040
以拯救无辜生命之名
What you've been compelled to do

627
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,004
你被迫所做的一切都是悲剧
In the name of saving innocent life is tragic.

628
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:18,031
有时候我们需要经受最可怕的炼狱
Sometimes we need to incur the most horrible losses

629
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:20,051
就为了坚持理想
In order to uphold the ideals

630
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,048
这些理想是我们国家的基石
That this country was founded on.

631
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,035
要是我们不以身作则
How can we presume to lead the world

632
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:28,032
怎么还有脸引领世界
Unless we set an example?

633
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,086
你说得轻巧
You make it sound so simple.

634
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,079
也许就是比你想的简单
Well,maybe it's simpler than you think.

635
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,035
也许你所看到的和你所做的一切
Maybe all the things that you've seen and all the things that you've done

636
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,013
已经蒙蔽了你的双眼
have clouded your vision.

637
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,094
看这个
Look at this.

638
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,038
给我说说这起车祸
Tell me about this car accident.

639
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,048
这跟朱玛没关系
That has nothing to do with juma.

640
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:52,078
受害者是谁
Who was the victim?

641
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,048
一个安插在斯塔克伍德里的线人
A source inside of starkwood. A whistle-blower.

642
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,095
不幸的是  他还是个酒鬼
Unfortunately,he was also a drunk.

643
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:59,005
在他从大西洋城回家的路上
He was killed when he wrecked his car

644
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,049
出车祸死了
On the way home from atlantic city.

645
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,015
血液酒精含量超标
Blood alcohol off the charts.

646
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,070
参议员  这绝对不是事故
Senator,this was no accident.

647
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,073
杀你线人的跟今晚
Your informant was murdered by the same man

648
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,040
杀伯内特的是同一个人
Who took ryan burnett out this evening.

649
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,080
这意味着什么呢  鲍尔
What does this mean,bauer?

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,007
他们怕他泄密
They were scared of what he had to say.

651
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:18,060
你的线人到底知道斯塔克伍德什么秘密
What does your informant have on starkwood?

652
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,094
他提出过很多轻率的指控
He made a lot of wild accusations,

653
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:21,098
但是没一次是可以告倒他们的
But not a single one of them panned out.

654
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:23,054
或许是因为你查得不够深
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.

655
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,054
参议员  我要知道他究竟告诉你什么了
Senator,i need to know exactly what he told you.

656
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:27,071
他声称斯塔克伍德
He alleged that starkwood

657
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,038
在勒索五角大楼的官员
Was blackmailing pentagon officials.

658
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,075
说他们涉嫌暗杀
That they were involved in assassination plots.

659
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,035
甚至说他们企图得到大规模杀伤性武器
Even that they were seeking to acquire their own wmds.

660
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,069
具体的是什么
Specifically what?

661
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,042
我记不清了  但我确信
Well,i don't remember,but i'm sure

662
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,065
电脑里应该有和他接头时的记录
That his interview transcript should be there.

663
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,076
好的  我找到了
Okay,i got it.

664
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:46,003
天哪
Oh,my god.

665
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,020
这就是了
That's it.

666
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,033
什么
What?

667
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,006
你的线人声称斯塔克伍德公司
Your informant claims that starkwood

668
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,020
企图获得生化武器
Was trying to acquire a bioweapon.

669
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,061
这就能联系上朱玛了
That's your connection to juma.

670
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,064
我不明白
I don't understand.

671
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:55,041
朱玛掌权的时候  传闻他在
When juma was in power,it was rumored

672
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,048
实施一项研制非法武器的计划
That he was running an illegal weapons program.

673
00:32:57,048 --> 00:32:59,025
他在研发一种生化武器
He was developing a bioweapon,

674
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:00,045
但没有人能证明
But nobody could prove it.

675
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,036
但是我在桑加拉时认识的人
But the people that i knew in sangala

676
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,092
坚信朱玛在拿自己的国民做实验
Believed he was testing these weapons on his own population.

677
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:08,013
他在一个偏僻的山村里释放了一种病菌
He used a remote village, Released some kind of pathogen.

678
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,086
那里所有的人变得痴呆
Everyone there was struck with dementia,

679
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,013
然后瘫痪  直至死亡
Paralysis and eventually died.

680
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:13,073
为什么没人追究
Why wasn't this pursued?

681
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,072
因为朱玛毁灭了所有的证据
'cause juma destroyed all the evidence.

682
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,071
他抢先一步  用燃烧弹把那里夷为了平地
He firebombed the village  before anyone could get there,

683
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:20,080
联合国的官员也总是很难相信
and UN officials had a hard time believing that juma had the technology

684
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,094
朱玛有技术和专长造出这样的武器
Or expertise to develop such a weapon.

685
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:25,057
但斯塔克伍德公司则是二者兼备
But starkwood... they had both.

686
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:27,067
技术和专长
The technology and the expertise.

687
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:29,088
那朱玛得给他们提供什么呢
And what did juma have to offer starkwood?

688
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,081
研发武器的安全场所
A safe haven to develop the weapon

689
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:34,061
和取之不尽的实验品
And an endless supply of victims to test it on.

690
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:37,095
即使这些都是真的
Even if all this was true,why in the world

691
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,022
那斯塔克伍德公司要生化武器干嘛
Would starkwood want a bioweapon?

692
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:42,099
参议员  过去的6个月
Senator,you've been trying to dismantle starkwood

693
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,062
你都在努力关闭斯塔克伍德公司
For the last six months.

694
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:46,066
这可能就是他们所策划的反击
Maybe they planned on fighting back.

695
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,076
但不管怎样  如果他们拥有这样的武器
But regardless,if they have a weapon like this,

696
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,056
你最好做好他们可能使用它的思想准备
You better believe they intend to use it.

697
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,093
迈尔参议员
Senator mayer!

698
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:55,061
我是首府警察
This is metro pd!

699
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:57,024
别动
Don't you move.

700
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,051
等等  等等
Hold on. hold on!

701
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:06,021
很明显  你发现了些线索
You're obviously on to something.

702
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,075
他们能帮你找到证明你清白的证据
They can help you find the evidence you need to prove your case.

703
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,015
现在他们都以为是我杀了伯内特
Right now everyone thinks i killed ryan burnett.

704
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:14,029
-没人会听我的  -我能保护你
- No one's gonna listen to me. - i can protect you.

705
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,079
我可以命令他们来帮助我们
I can order them to help us.

706
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,084
斯塔克伍德已经渗透到白宫了
Starkwood infiltrated the white house.

707
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:19,049
一旦他们发现你在追查他们研发
As soon as they find out you're going after them

708
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:22,005
生化武器一事  就会马上销毁证据的
For a bioweapon,they'll bury the evidence.

709
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,096
那么我们就让知道的人越少越好
Then we'll keep the circle small.

710
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:25,090
我可以做到的
I can make this happen.

711
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,037
你牺牲了这么多来保护政府
It's time for you to start trusting the institutions

712
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:31,087
该是你相信它一回的时候了
That you've sacrificed so much to protect.

713
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,087
信任可不是我最大的优点
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

714
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,078
孩子  你总要有所转变
Son,you have to start somewhere.

715
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,068
参议员
Senator!

716
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:41,041
我是首府警察
This is metro pd!

717
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,062
你真的认为你能做到吗
You really think you can do this?

718
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:45,072
我对自己有信心
I know i can.

719
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,069
让他们进来吧
Let 'em in.

720
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,090
不
No!

721
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,078
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

722
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,011
是的  利维
Yes,livy.

723
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:09,065
伊桑刚报告给我一件很恼人的事情
Ethan just come to me with something very disturbing.

724
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:12,082
我想是有关向媒体透露杰克消息的事吧
I assume it's about the press leak regarding jack bauer.

725
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:17,022
伊桑觉得你跟这事有关
Ethan seems to think you had something to do with it.

726
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:18,063
不是我干的
I didn't.

727
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:20,033
我已经告诉过他了
I already told him that.

728
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:24,059
鉴于你俩之前的过节  他不相信你
Well,given the past experience between the two of you,he's not convinced.

729
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,050
你怎么认为呢
And what do you think?

730
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,040
我想听听你怎么说
I think i need to hear what you have to say.

731
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,034
她没什么好辩解的  总统阁下
There's nothing she can say,madam president.

732
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,017
只有几个人知道详情
She was one of the few people

733
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:34,074
她是其中之一
Who knew all the details.

734
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:37,068
知道的人  比你想象得要多
More people knew than you think.

735
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,042
我刚和CNB电视台的
I just got off the phone

736
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:42,042
白宫栏目制片人通过电话
with the white house segment producer at CNB.

737
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,002
他不愿透露线人的名字
He won't give me the source's name,

738
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,025
但是他愿意证明
But he's willing to confirm

739
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,089
是联邦执法办里的人走漏了消息
That the leak came from someone inside the Federal Marshal's office.

740
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:51,043
他担保消息既不是从白宫散布出去的
He'll guarantee it didn't come from the white house,

741
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,013
也不是从我这泄露出去的
Or from me.

742
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:56,053
可以证明给我看吗
This is verifiable?

743
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:00,010
制片人的名字叫查理·艾萨克森
Producer's name is charlie isakson.

744
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,080
这是他的电话
Here's his number.

745
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,087
不信的话  你可以亲自打给他
