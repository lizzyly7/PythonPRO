在我们查出杜巴库的内线之前

79
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:29,018
这要等见了医生才知道
We're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him.

80
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,065
阁下  我不得不告诉您  他失血严重
Ma'am,i have to warn you, he has lost a lot of blood.

81

没有  他在我们到之前就离开了

83
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,065
总统阁下
Madame president,

84
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,079
既然您丈夫是杜巴库
Since your husband was the only leverage

85
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,035
留在这里的唯一筹码  那么
That dubaku had left, it's safe to say

86
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,092
他现在应该准备离开这个国家了
That he is trying to leave the country now.

87
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:43,086
你认为他下一步准备做什么呢

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,056
他的人在这次行动中都死了

沃克探员和我将继续追踪

我们将搜索整个地区
We'll continue to search the area.

92
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:51,073
我们不得不假设杜巴库已经计划好了
We have to assume that dubaku has an exit strategy

93
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,083
撤退的方案
Already in place.

94
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,010
无论如何我们都要抓到他

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,090
而且必须要快
We're going to ha to do it fast.

104
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,003
阁下  这恐怕不行
Ma'am,that's not possible.

105
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,013
您正在指挥一场军事行动

没有我在  将军们也能胜任这次行动

特勤局有内鬼的事实
The secret service has been compromised

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,074
我们无法保证您在
There's no way we can ensure your safety outside

110
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,017
-白宫外的安全  -我不在乎
the white house. I don't give a damn.

111
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,014
我不想在我丈夫生命垂危的时刻
I am not going to be held prisoner in this office

112
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,008
还把自己关在这间办公室里
while my husband is fighting for his life.

113
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,078
现在  要么找人
Now,either find some one

114
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:39,055
送我去医院  要么我自己开车去
To take me to the hospital or I'll drive there myself.

115
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:42,082
总统阁下  您了解我的工作履历
Madame president, you know my record of service.

116
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,079
如果您同意的话

00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,029
我愿意担当您的保护工作
To assume responsibility for your security.

118
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,029
比尔  你已经不在职了
Bill,you're no longer credentialed.

119
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,076
你没有这个权限
You don't have the authority.

120
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,073
除非我们抓到杜巴库并审讯他
Until we capture dubaku and interrogate him,

121
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,076
不然我们根本不知道政府中还有谁
We have no idea who in the government is working

122
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,080
为他工作
For him.

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,073
您不知道可以信任谁
You do not know who you can trust.

124
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,057
但我可以信任你
But I can trust you.

125
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,043
是我告知了您这次危机
I brought this conspiracy to your attention,

126
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,000
总统阁下
Madame president.

127

我希望您能让我把它解决
I would hope that I could end it.

128
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,091
你需要我做什么
What do you need from me?

允许我清查白宫全体官员

131
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,028
并让我的人进入联邦调查局

132
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,079
给拉里·莫斯提供战术支持

133
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,029
你想带谁进入

00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,049
克罗伊·奥布赖恩

我可以保证  她是最佳人选
I can vouch for her; shs the best there is.

136
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:24,079
她的权限在反恐小组被解散时被收回了
Her clearances were also revoked when ctu was decommissioned.

137
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,026
除了她以外我们就没有
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these duties

138
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,043
别的人能胜任这项工作了吗
Without our having to reinstate her?

139
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:32,033
调查局里有人为杜巴库工作
Someone in the bureau is on dubaku's payroll.

140
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,043
除非我们找出这个人
Until we find out who it is,

141
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,067
否则拉里·莫斯是不会
Larry moss can't take the chance

142
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,070
冒险把他的人

送去调查的
Into a manhunt for dubaku.

144
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:40,007
好吧
All right.

145
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,081
白宫特勤局的负责人是
The director of white house secret service operations

146
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,095
霍维斯探员
Is agent hovis.

我会命令他把安全协议转交给你
I'll order him to turn over security protocols to you.

148
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,012
我了解霍维斯  总统阁下

他可不喜欢这样  他会给我们找麻烦

152
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,049
我才不在乎他乐意与否
I don't give a damn what he likes.

恐怕移民局的人正在抓我

玛丽卡  我们谈过这事

她需要我  我是唯一能照顾她的人

我们的计划  至少现在不行
Of our plans, at least not yet.

210
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,031
我必须告诉她  我不能就这样一走了之
I have to; I can't just run off.

211
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:56,074
不  不行  她会给我们找麻烦

安排一条航道挺麻烦的

朱玛将军要是知道你放弃了任务

00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,019

布坎南告诉我  你和鲍尔跟他们交火了

我就是暂时参与下调查局的技术活

341
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,087

抓到他后  希望他能交出

00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,096
如果有什么意外发生
On my way out of the country--

460
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:17,089
事故或者蓄意谋杀
An accident or an assassination attempt,anything--

461
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,066
比如你慷慨捐赠的飞机
If the plane that you

462
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,070
爆炸了的话
Were so generous to donate decides to explode,

463
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,083
所有与我相关的人员和银行交易记录

464
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,017
都会被送到司法部查处
Of all those involved will be sent to the justice department.

465
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,094
完全没有这个必要
That is completely unnecessary.

466
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:30,017
上面所说一切
The same holds true

467
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,014
同样适用于玛丽卡·道诺索
If anything should happen to marika donoso.

468
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,081
我发誓  她对此事一无所知
I swear to you, she knows nothing of this.

469
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,038
她不会威胁到你们
She is no threat to you.

470
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,018
别忘了提醒你的司机
Make sure your driver knows this before he brings her to me.

471
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,055
明白我的意思吗
Do you understand what I am saying?

472
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,042
我需要一个肯定的答复
I want you to tell me that you understand

473
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,032
这样才能确保
What I am saying to you, so there

474
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,032
万无一失
Will be no mistakes.

475
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,076
明白了
I understand.

476
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,086
很好
Good.

477
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,043
伯纳特先生  同雇佣兵合作
The one thing I have learned

478
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:57,013
我学到一件事  就是他们
In the company of mercenaries, mr. burnett,is that ultimately,

479
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:59,050
只管自己的死活
They care about nothing but their own survival.

480
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,004
好运
Good day.

481
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,072

I was right.

482
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:16,069
杜巴库猜到我们要干掉他
Dubaku suspected we were gonna take him out,and apparently,

483
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,059
他收集了证据来保护自己
He assembled evidence to use as an insurance policy.

484
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,086
我们得让他顺利地离开
We need to make sure he gets out of the country

485
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:21,096
踏上逃亡之路
And safely into exile.

486
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,036
不然我们就完蛋了
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

487
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,046
我去做下安排
I'll make the calls.

488
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:32,000

塞缪尔向我坦白了
Samuel told me the truth.

496
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,042
如你所料  他是非法移民
He's an illegal, just like you thought.

497
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,069
他必须得离开
He has to leave the country,

498

511
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,075
你为什么就不让我和他在一起
Why can't you let me have this?

512
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,011
我不相信他
I don't trust him.

513
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,085
任何喜欢我的男人
Oh,well, you never liked any man

每次我的幸福来临时

合同里写的明明白白

你已经退休了  皮尔斯先生
You've retired, mr. pierce.

或许没人通知您
Perhaps no one informed you

791
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:10,022
几个月前  我拒绝了特勤局的保护
I refused secret service protection months ago.

792

00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:29,017
非要在做生意的时候找我
For my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

801
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:30,065
这我不便透露  女士
I'm not at liberty to say,ma'am.

802

事关机密

00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,002
除非你告诉我什么事
I'm not going anywhere with you

808
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:47,070
否则我不会和你走
Until you tell me what this is about.

809

是防火墙评测之类的事
Something to do with the firewall assessment

要是拉里想要  为什么不直接找我

我觉得拉里把克洛伊·奥布莱恩

826

这女人带来顶替我

我只想知道 他们在干什么

我只想让她知道除我们外
I wanted her to know there was another option

864
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,031
她还有别的选择
Than waiting for us to swoop in.

如果想找到杜巴库  就别无选择

拜托  你也指挥过这样的行动

这次完全没有战术支持
Not without full tactical support,

869

至少要有两组人作为后背增援
And at least two backup units on the scene.

870

她没有丝毫保障  杰克  我不赞成

好人没好报  这就是现实

至少她选择参与这件事

876
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:13,090
做正确的事
To be involved, to do the right thing.

877
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,013
单就这点
Which is a lot more

878
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,080
就比杜巴库其他的帮凶强
Than I can say for dubaku's other victims.

879
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,037
我们只有一个任务  就是找到杜巴库
We have one job here-- that's to get dubaku.

880

其他的事  不要多想

继续向西行进  穿过罕布什尔大街
Continuing west on our street, crossing hampshire avenue.

896
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,076

才窃听到他的电话

你能切断他们的

为什么还在帮他

他威胁说会利用手中的名单

不可能
That's impossible.

玛丽卡不会这么做
Marika would never do this.

上校  我说了  他们在跟踪她
