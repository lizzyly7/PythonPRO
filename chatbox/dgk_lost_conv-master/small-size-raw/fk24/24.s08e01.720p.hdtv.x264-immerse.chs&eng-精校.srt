小乖乖  我们商量过了  记得吗
Sweetheart, we already talked about this, remember?

33
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,080
你得叫我外公
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa."

34
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:22,038
但你看起来不像个外公呀
You don't look like a grandpa.

35
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,098
其实我也这么觉得
Couldn't agree with you more.

36
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:28,013
这卡通真没意思
The cartoon I turned on is boring.

37
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,013
好吧  那我们换个台
Okay. We'll find another one.

38
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,074
这是当代最大胆的外交提议
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation.

39
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:38,092
也许能为整个区域
It could finally lay a foundation for real peace

40
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:40,026
奠定全面和平的基础
throughout the entire region.

41
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,081
鲍勃  总统可谓是在这次谈判上
Well, you know, Bob, the president's certainly betting her legacy

42
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,027
赌上了她的政治生涯
on the success of these negotiations...

43
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:48,018
外公  这不是卡通片
Grandpa! This isn't a cartoon!

44
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,016
好吧
Okay, okay.

45
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:53,003
一群白熊
A sloth of bears...

46
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,012
就看这个  我喜欢这部
This one! I like this one!

47
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:57,061

喂
Yeah?

50
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,078
老爸  抱歉我们晚了
Hi, dad. Sorry we're late.

51
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:09,079
路过联合国大厦必须绕行
They're redirecting everyone around the UN.

52
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,056
没关系  我们相处很好
It's all right. We're doing fine.

53
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,001
动物园之行如何
How was the zoo?

54
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,011
实话说
Well, to be honest with you,

55
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,074
我们基本是在不断地奔波于
we spent most of our time just going back and forth

56
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,086
黑熊与北极熊之间
between the black bears and the polar bears.

57
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,074
我忘记跟你说  她正在熊熊热
I forgot to mention that she's going through a bear phase.

58
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,055
她明白自己所爱那是最好
Well, she certainly knows what she wants.

59
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,096
她让我想起你
She reminds me of you.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,013
真有趣
Well, that's funny.

61
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,088
我常对斯蒂芬说  她让我想起你
I always tell Stephen how much she reminds me of you.

62
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,083
我们过几分钟就到
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.

63
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,028
收到  别担心
Okay. Don't worry.

64
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,053
到时在大厅见
We'll meet you in the lobby.

65
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:35,081
好的
Great.

66
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,060
听起来他们处得不错
Sounds like they had fun.

67
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:40,073
当然啦
They always do.

68
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,067
怎么了
What's wrong?

69
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:46,053
刚来时  我跟他提过搬去洛杉矶的事
We talked to him about moving to LA the night we got here.

70
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,023
嗯  他说要考虑一下
Yeah. He said he'd think about it.

71
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:50,031
之后  他对此事只字不提
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned one word about it since.

72
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,048
今晚我们都要走了
And we leave tonight.

73
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:53,037
或许他还得定期就医
Well, maybe he has to check with his doctors.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,093
不是  医院两周前就让他出院了
No, they cleared him two weeks ago.

75
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:57,017
他的治疗已经结束了
He's finished with treatment.

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,009
搞不清楚
I don't know.

77
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,057
我父亲独自生活时间太久
My father has been on his own for so long.

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,080
也许他已经忘记了如何与人相处
Maybe he doesn't know how to live any other way.

79
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,049
你怎么不再问他一次
Why don't you just ask him again?

80
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,053
我父亲可不喜欢被人问两次
My father is not the type of person you ask twice.

81
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,056
我可以替你问他
If you want, I can do it.

82
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,063
联合国前方为您报道
Here at the United Nations,

83
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,026
白宫发言人刚刚确认
a white house spokesman just confirmed

稍后将立即召开联合新闻发布会

86
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:28,015
众人广为期待哈桑总统

87
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:31,072
将宣布撤除其国的核武器项目

88
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:35,055
哈桑总统发表声明说  此次谈判
President Hassan has stated that he considers these negotiations

89
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:38,088
是历史性的成功  是其国家的新纪元
a historic success and a new beginning for his country

90
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:41,010
也是整个中东地区的新纪元
and the entire mideast region.

91
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,088
我相信我们已经达成了共识
I believe that that is a reasonable compromise.

92
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:48,012
总统先生  我们还有一些问题需要澄清
Now, Mr. President, let's move on to the issue of verification.

93
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,077
您最新提案的文字有些语意含糊
The language in your latest proposal is vague.

94
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,072
我来说清楚
Let me be clear.

95
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:58,084
我的国家同意放弃核武器的开发研制
My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons

96
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,080
并愿意接受国际原子能组织的监督
with full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,083
总统先生  我们的条件
But our terms, Mr. President,

98
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:07,073
是要由美国派出监督团队
were that the inspectors themselves would be American,

99
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,023
而非国际原子能组织
not IAEA.

100
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,087
恕我直言  总统阁下
With respect, Madam President,

101
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:13,087
贵方一再要求这点  但我们从未让步
your side pushed the point, but we never conceded.

102
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,046
也恕我直言
With respect,

103
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:19,027
贵方在这点上从未显示过诚意
your side has refused to negotiate the point in good faith.

104
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,089
若没有美方人员在场
Without Americans on the ground--

105
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,060
我们当然不会让一个几百人的团体
Surely, we're not going to let the nationality of a few hundred men--

106
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,037
我们不想引发争论
Verification has no teeth.

107
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:27,054
只有美国是可信的  是吗
So, only the United States can be trusted,

108
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:28,052
国务卿先生
Mr. Secretary?

109
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,054
这就是你向全世界传达的信息
This is the message that you sent to the rest of the world

110
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:32,065
你还问我们为什么不想协商
and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate.

111
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,027
法哈德
Farhad.

112
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,010
总统阁下
Madam President,

113
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,065
请原谅我弟弟的莽撞
please excuse my brother's passion.

114
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,066
他只是为我们的国家考虑
He only wants what is best for our country.

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,037
可以理解
I understand.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
但此问题解决之前  无法继续讨论其他事项
But we need to resolve this issue before we can move forward.

117
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:49,007
新闻发布会即将召开
And ideally, before the press conference,

118
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,037
我们只剩下不到一小时了
which gives us less than an hour.

119
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,055
总统阁下
Madame President...

120
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,000
如果我的革命卫士
what would your congress say

121
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:57,096
驻扎在您的国土上
if my revolutionary guard

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,049
国会会有什么反应呢
was stationed on your soil?

123
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,070
我国国会也持同样的态度
It's the same with my national assembly.

124
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:09,025
即便我同意了  我国议会也不会批准
Even if I agreed to this, they would not ratify it.

125
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:11,092
毕竟  我不是皇帝
After all, I'm not a king.

126
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,012
我也不是女皇
Nor I a queen.

127
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,075
真是太不幸了
Too bad for both of us.

128
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:19,096
我提议暂时休会
I'd like to adjourn

129
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:22,080
我们与各自团队商议一下
and discuss this issue with our respective teams.

130
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,047
没问题
Of course.

131
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:39,079
你知道  他在从政之前是做推销的
You are aware he was a salesman before entering politics.

132
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,063
卖家用电器
Household appliances.

133
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:45,016
他肯定卖掉了不少电冰箱
You want to bet he sold a lot of refrigerators?

134
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:49,062
想个办法  满足他的要求
Find a way to give him what he wants.

135
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,027
总统阁下
Madam President...

136
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,076
我意已决
You heard me.

137
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:55,003
想办法让监管计划得以施行
Try to make the inspections work.

138
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,062
他是个难得的领袖
This man is a once in a lifetime leader.

139
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:02,008
他已经停止了对恐怖组织的支持
And he has already suspended his support for terrorist organizations,

140
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,067
私下里  他还拥护两国方案
and privately, he's advocating for a two-state solution.

141
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:08,059
我们还能再指望他冒多大风险
How much further can we expect him to stick his neck out?

142
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:27,064
到这儿来
Hey, come here.

143
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:29,027
-你给他取名了吗  -熊熊
- Did you name him yet? - Bear.

144
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,007
-熊熊  -她在那里
- "Bear".  - There she is.

145
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:39,073
我听说你跟外公刚才和小熊一起玩呢
I heard that you and grandpa were hanging out with the bears.

146
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,090
我们还吃了冰激凌
Then we had ice cream,

147
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,020
但我不喜欢我的那个
But I didn't like mine,

148
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,012
外公就把他的给我了
So grandpa gave me his.

149
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,022
-真棒  -我来抱她
- That's nice. - Here, I got her.

150
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,031
-谢谢你能照顾她  杰克  -不客气
- Thanks for watching her, Jack.  - Of course.

151
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:53,047
我们之前谈的事  我想了很多
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about.

152
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,058
我已经决定了
And I've made up my mind.

153
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:59,021
我想要和你一起搬回洛杉矶
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

154
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,060
-真的吗  -真的
- Really?  - Yeah.

155
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,070
我有个朋友  开了家私人安保公司
I got a friend who's got a private security firm.

156
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,000
他答应给我份咨询的工作
Said he'd give me some consulting work.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,062
我还可以租他的房子
He's also got a place I can rent.

158
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,031
爸爸  我都不知说什么好了
Dad, I don't know what to say.

159
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:08,096
过来抱抱
Come here.

160
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,019
你什么都不用说
You don't have to say anything.

161
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,079
今晚接我去机场就行了
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight.

162
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,030
你想今晚和我们一起走吗
Wait, you're coming with us tonight?

163
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,063
如果方便的话
If it's okay.

164
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,067
斯蒂芬
Stephen.

165
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,011
他今晚和我们一起走
He's coming with us tonight.

166
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,055
我还有一点东西要打包
And I've just got a few more things to pack.

167
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:20,070
我本来东西就不多
I don't have very much.

168
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,046
一小时后  我就可以去酒店找你们
I can be at your hotel in about an hour.

169
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,080
太棒了  我们现在就回去打包
That's perfect. We can get back and finish packing ourselves.

170
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,006
外公和你一起飞回洛杉矶  好不好啊
It'll be all right if I fly back to Los Angeles with you?

171
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,083

175
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:41,090
-好的  -我们要上车了
- Okay.  - We're going in the car.

176
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,090
我帮你系好安全带
Get your belt done up...

177
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:57,011
爸爸  我真高兴你能答应
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.

178
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,007
我也高兴
Me, too.

179
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,099
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you.  - Love you.

180
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,019
伙计们  一小时后见
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour.

181
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,083
-再见  -再见  小乖乖
- See you.  - Bye, sweetheart.

182
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,089
再见
Bye!

183
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,040
各位下午好
Good afternoon, everyone.

184
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,007
下午好
Good afternoon.

185
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,008
记者会召开之前  我有几件事宣布一下
All right, just a few things before we get started here.

186
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,019
泰勒总统和哈桑总统在秘书长的引荐后
Presidents Taylor and Hassan will each make a statement

187
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,077
将各自签署一项声明
after they've been introduced by the secretary-general.

188
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,073
随后是提问环节
The Q&A will follow,

189
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,037
希望各位严格围绕相关问题提问
but I want you to keep your questions strictly on topic.

190
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:54,046
显而易见  会议将在高度安保措施下进行
For obvious reasons, we're all operating under heightened security measures,

191
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,085
所以  除非你特想尝尝锁喉的感觉
so, unless you've been dying to know what a chokehold feels like,

192
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,076
请一定将证件放在身上醒目位置
keep your credentials visible at all times. All right?

193
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,023
就说这些了
That's all for now.

194
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,046
梅瑞狄斯·里德  记者
Meredith Reed, press.

195
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,045
您的证件无效
It's invalid.

196
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,038
什么
What?

197
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,006
不可能
It can't be invalid.

198
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,091
你能再检查一遍吗
Can you double check?

199
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:21,043
我已试过了  女士  你的证件被注销了
I did, ma'am. Your credentials have been revoked.

200
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:22,095
谁注销的
Revoked by whom?

201
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,060
这我无法得知
I don't have that information.

202
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,080
肯定是有地方弄错了
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.

203
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,070
你认得我  我天天都来参加此会议的
You do remember me. I've been here every day.

204
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,042
请退到一边  女士
Please step aside, ma'am.

205
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,013
国务卿卡宁刚才来找我
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.

206
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:47,073
他同意由国际原子能组织监察
He's agreed to IAEA inspectors.

207
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,087
好消息
That's good news.

208
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,022
有个附加条件
There is a condition attached.

209
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,013
他们坚持
They're insisting that

210
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,000
监察小组的领导要由美国人担任
the head of the verification team be an American.

211
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,072
我觉得这条可以接受  你认为呢
I think we can live with that, don't you?

212
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,038
你知道我的立场
You know where I stand.

213
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,018
为和平之名  我们已牺牲太多
We've already surrendered too much in the name of peace.

214
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,053
说"牺牲"太极端了  法哈德
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad.

215
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,006
我们牺牲了什么
And what have we surrendered really,

216
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,072
不过是对核武器的野心
apart from our nuclear ambition?

217
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:13,009
这还不够吗
Isn't that enough?

218
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,064
运作六千台离心机的确能带来政治筹码
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges is good for political maneuvering,

219
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:19,011
但也会拖垮我国的经济
but it's helping to bankrupt our country.

220
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,052
事实上
The truth is,

221
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:22,078
真正慷慨的不是我们
we are not the ones being so generous.

222
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,049
泰勒总统正准备取消经济制裁
President Taylor is lifting economic sanctions,

223
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:28,030
并愿意提供几十亿美元的援助项目
and offering an aid package worth billions of dollars.

224
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,052
我们的目的都已达到  法哈德
We got everything we wanted, Farhad.

225
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:32,035
但愿这不是骗局
As long as it's not a trick.

226
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,024
你好
Hello.

227
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:44,001
你好  很抱歉为这种小事烦扰你
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you with something so mundane,

228
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,078
我被拒之门外了
but I'm stuck outside.

229
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,092
被拒了
Stuck?

230
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,090
我的新闻采访资格证被注销了
My press credentials have been revoked.

231
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,007
我也不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happened.

232
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,040
我会解决的
I'll take care of it.

233
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,081
你确定
Are you sure?

234
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,006
当然
Of course.

235
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,014
谢谢
Thank you.

236
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:01,026
晚些时候  你还有空接受采访吗
Will you, uh, will you still have time for the interview later?

237
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,096
可以  新闻发布会后
Yes. After the press conference.

238
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,065
我非常期待  总统先生
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President.

239
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:07,015
我也一样
So am I.

240
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,091
恢复里德小姐的安检通行证
Reinstate miss Reed's clearance.

241
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,089
我只是
I was only...

242
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,005
照做就是
Just do it.

243
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,044
奥马
Omar,

244
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,047
人们已经开始谈论你和这记者的事
people are starting to talk about you and this reporter.

245
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:23,008
他们说什么
And saying what?

246
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:26,091
里德小姐作为记者  为报社做我的专访
Miss Reed is a journalist and she's profiling me for her newspaper.

247
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,009
你对她有感情了
But you have feelings for her.

248
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,013
我对她很友好而已
I'm friendly with her.

249
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,095
随你怎么想
Think whatever you like.

250
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:35,024
这女人对我或对和平进程  没有任何威胁
This woman poses no threat to me or the peace process.

251
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:37,002
在这里或许没有
Not here maybe,

252
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,064
但在我们国家  你会因此声名狼藉
but back in our country you'll be torn apart.

253
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:42,085
毛拉会说  你被西方腐蚀了
The Mullahs will say that you have been corrupted by the west.

254
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,056
你怎么看  法哈德
What do you say, Farhad?

255
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,061
我有吗
Have I?

256
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,012
我有被西方所腐蚀吗
Have I been corrupted by the west?

257
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:50,056
你知道我不会相信的
You know I don't believe that.

258
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,030
但你要记住自己是已婚
But you are married.

259
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,045
达莉亚很久以前  就不是我妻子了
Dalia hasn't been a wife to me for a long time.

260
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,011
这不是行为不检的理由
That's no excuse to be reckless.

261
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,001
我没有任何行为不检
I've done nothing reckless.

262
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,045
我没做过
I've done nothing reckless.

263
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:07,032
去恢复里德小姐的安检通行证吧
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.

264
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:11,017
我会的
I'll see to it.

265
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,022
维克多
Victor.

266
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,061
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

267
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,089
你怎么找到我的
How the hell did you find me?

268
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,056
我一向消息灵通  杰克
I was always resourceful, Jack.

269
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,015
你也是你欣赏我的地方
That's what you liked about me.

270
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:46,056
赶紧进来
Get in here.

271
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,058
坐好
Take a seat.

272
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,062
发生了什么
What happened?

273
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,068
我需要你的帮助
I need help.

274
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,095
你需要的是救护车
You need an ambulance.

275
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:53,090
不  别打电话
No, no, don't call.

276
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,097
这样正中他们下怀
That's what he's waiting for.

277
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:57,060
-有人监听着急救频道  -谁
- He's listening to the emergency channels.  - Who?

278
00:15:57,063 --> 00:16:00,032
听说我  杰克  我有重要情报
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information.

279
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,049
我唯一能帮你的  就是给你叫辆救护车
The best I can do for you, Victor, is get you an ambulance.

280
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,059
我早不干了  不再为政府工作了
I'm out. I don't work for the government anymore.

281
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,021
我这情报  你绝对想听
Oh, this you're going to want to hear.

282
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:08,007
为什么
Why?

283
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:11,045
为什么  因为你总能做出正确的选择
Why? Because you're the guy who always does the right thing.

284
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,035
有人策划了一项重大刺杀行动
There's a big hit going down.

285
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,032
刺杀谁
On who?

286
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,072
联合国大厦里的哈桑总统
President Hassan at the UN.

287
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,004
他即将遇刺
He's getting taken out.

288
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:20,087
-几时  -今天
- When?  - Today.

289
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,088
在他和泰勒总统签下条约之前
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

290
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,043
你瞧  我就说你会感兴趣
You see? I told you you'd be interested.

291
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,086
你怎么知道这些的
How do you know this?

292
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,079
是我负责把杀手偷渡入境的
I'm the one that got the hitter into the country.

293
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,048
我安顿好了他的一切
I've been setting him up with what he needs.

294
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:34,019
现在他打算干掉你
And then he tried to take you out.

295
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:38,009
杰克  反恐小组里只有你和我打过交道
Look, Jack, you're the only one at CTU I ever did business with.

296
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:39,052
我要你给他们打电话  为我担保
I need you to call them, vouch for me,

297
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,056
帮我和他们达成协议
so I can cut a deal.

298
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,013
帮帮忙  杰克
Come on, Jack.

299
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,020
给我坐好
Keep your seat.

300
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:45,070
我发誓  这事千真万确
Look, I swear, this is real.

301
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,023
有人试图阻止
Someone is trying to make sure

302
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,019
这份和平协议的签订
that this peace agreement does not happen.

303
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,009
先把枪给我  再说别的
I'm not doing anything until you give me your weapon.

304
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,084
你最好别给我耍花招
Better not be screwing with me.

305
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,007
我没有  我发誓
I'm not. I swear, I'm not.

306
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,065
杀手是谁  叫什么名字
Who's the hitter? What's his name?

307
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,092
杀手是谁
Who's the hitter?!

308
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,068
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

309
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,054
-好像是俄罗斯人  -不够
- He's Russian or something.  - Not good enough.

310
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:07,095
-杀手是谁  -听我说
- Who is the hitter?! - Look.

311
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,071
我知道怎么在刺杀行动前找到并阻止他
I know how to find him and stop him before he makes the hit.

312
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:15,016
但达成协议之前  我不会透露半个字
But I'm not saying another word until I make my deal.

313
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,045
你该庆幸我退休了
You're lucky I'm retired.

314
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,038
我是科尔·奥迪斯
This is Cole Ortiz.

315
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,028
叫辛格小队移动到东北角
Move Singer's team to the northeast quadrant,

316
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,021
告诉他  从现在起
and tell him, from now on,

317
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:49,003
每15分钟给我汇报一次情况
I want updates every quarter hour.

318
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:51,017
确认后打给我
Get back to me with confirmations.

319
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,037
黑斯廷斯要你把联合国大厦的巡逻范围
Hastings wants you to expand the patrol perimeter around the UN

320
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,053
再增加400米
another quarter mile.

321
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,049
我很高兴他这么想
I'm glad that's what he wants,

322
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,087
但我的人手只勉强够覆盖目前的巡逻范围
but I barely have enough men to cover the perimeter now.

323
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,068
我想法找纽约警察来帮忙巡逻
I'll see if I can get NYPD to help you cover.

324
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,004
丹娜
Uh, Dana?

325
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,092
我姐姐说  她给你留言了好几次
My sister.. She said she left you a couple of messages.

326
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,056
商量伴娘礼服的事
Something about bridesmaids' dresses.

327
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,097
我告诉她  你的语音信箱可能出了点问题
I told her there was probably something wrong with your voicemail.

328
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:10,082
我收到留言了
I got her messages.

329
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:13,048
只是没时间回复  这加班加的
I just haven't had a chance. These double shifts...

330
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,078
我修改了联合国大厦的巡逻方案
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN.

331
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,098
下发任务前  先给你过目
Thought you might like to take a look at it before I distributed it.

332
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,016
好  我看看
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

333
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,007
我会给你姐姐回电话的  我保证
I will call your sister back, I promise.

334
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,094
该死  到底是什么问题
Damn it, what is the problem?

335
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,021
冲击维护
Percussive maintenance?

336
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,074
我的网络应用程序教授
That's what my network apps professor

337
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:35,055
看到我砸电脑时  给起的名
called it when I hit my computer.

338
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:36,069
能帮忙吗
Can I help?

339
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:39,001
我刚拿到最新修订的发布会出席名单
I just got the revised attendee list for the press conference.

340
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,080
来不及完成面部识别
I can't get the facial recognition done in time.

341
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,062
你单独一个个地扫描
Oh, you're running each person through individually.

342
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,096
其实可以批量识别
You can do them in a batch.

343
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:47,015
但是资料格式不匹配
Not if the data's in different formats.

344
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,008
老黄历了  现在改进了
Well, that used to be true, but here.

345
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,078
我说过  向他人求助并不丢脸
Like I said, there's no reason to be shy about asking for help. Okay?

346
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,074
别着急  你很快就能跟上  你行的
Don't worry. You'll catch up. You're doing great.

347
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,021
不好意思
Excuse me.

348
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,091
我是奥布赖恩
O'brian.

349
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,008
克罗伊  是我杰克
Chloe, it's jack.

350
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,064
金好吗  你告诉她洛杉矶的事了吗
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA?

351
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,007
谈过  我现在没法细说
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now.

352
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,099
我要跟头儿讲话
I need to speak to the director.

353
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,094
黑斯廷斯先生正在通话中
Mr. Hastings is on the phone,

354
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:17,003
他很讨厌被别人打断
and he really doesn't like to be interrupted.

355
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:19,050
告诉他事关刺杀哈桑总统
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot to assassinate president Hassan.

356
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,038
看看能否引起他的关注
See if that gets his attention.

357
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,038
好的  稍等
Okay, hold on.

358
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:34,020
给我联合国大厦的层图  西侧视角
All right, now, give me an overlay on the UN, view from the west.

359
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:38,028
再给我安全控管小组的分布图

给我事件报告与卫星图像的比对结果
Now, give me a comp with incident reports and Satellite imaging.

362
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,080
打搅一下  黑斯廷斯先生
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

363
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,078
盖瑞  稍等一下
Gary, hold on for a second.

364
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:51,043
杰克·鲍尔在三线  他说有事向您报告

365
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,012

00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:54,055
事关暗杀哈桑总统

367
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,050
我想您会接听这个电话
I thought you'd want to take the call.

368
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,058
盖瑞  我等下再打给你
Gary, I'll call you back.

369
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,050
鲍尔先生  我是布赖恩·黑斯廷斯
Mr. Bauer, this is Brian Hastings.

370
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,080
黑斯廷斯先生  我以前的线人说
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an informant that I used to run who's claiming

371
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,067
他有关于刺杀哈桑总统行动的情报
he's got intel on an assassination attempt on president Hassan.

372
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,026
而且行动就在今天
He says it's going to take place today.

373
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,097
我们已接获多起关于威胁和平会谈的举报
We've received several threats in regard to the peace conference.

374
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,020
可以想象
I can only imagine.

375
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,091
我的线人名叫维克多·阿鲁兹
My informant's name is Victor Aruz.

376
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,021
他是我在撒拉扎尔行动中的线人
I used him in the Salazar op.

377
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,081
-你应该能找到他的档案  -查一下
- You should be able to pull his file.  - Pull it up.

378
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,006
他手臂中枪  说是暗杀者干的
He's been shot in the arm-- he claims by the assassin.

379
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:25,015
我认为这事决不能等闲视之
Look, I don't think this is something you should take lightly.

380
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:28,067
阿鲁兹先生想要怎样的回报
And what does Mr. Aruz want in return for his information?

381

反恐小组的保护以及豁免权

382
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:32,082
他太贪了  鲍尔先生
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.

383
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,066
你调出他的档案了吗
Have you pulled his file yet?

384
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,042
没有
No.

385
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,015
黑斯廷先生  我了解这混蛋
Mr. Hastings, I know this son of a bitch,

386
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,032
直觉告诉我  你需要对此事引起警觉
and my instinct is telling me that you need to pay attention to this.

387
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,094
光凭你的直觉还不够  鲍尔先生
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer.

388
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:46,053
这里不再是你熟知的反恐小组了
CTU isn't the organization you knew.

389
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,033
也罢  但你听好了
Okay, fine, but understand this:

390
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,000
倘若哈桑总统有什么不测
if anything happens to president Hassan,

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,002
我有责任向泰勒总统报告

392
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,035
告诉她  我曾向你提供此情报
and tell her that I tried to provide you with this intel,

393
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,057
但却被你无视了
and you ignored it.

394
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,014
调个档案怎么要这么久
What is taking so long for the file?

395
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,041
抱歉  我还在搜索卷宗
Sorry. I'm still searching through the archives.

396
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,040
黑斯廷斯先生  你现在就得答复我
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now.

397
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,074
你打算询问阿鲁兹吗
Are you bringing Aruz in or not?

398
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,055
让我跟他说话
Let me talk to him.

399
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:13,028
我打开免提
I'll put you on speaker.

00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,031
说吧
Go ahead.

401
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:16,038
阿鲁兹先生
Mr. Aruz,

402
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,009
我需要更多细节以证实你的情报
I'm gonna need some other details to corroborate your story.

00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,048
暗杀者干掉了我的两个手下

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,074
你会被开除的
you're gonna be out of a job.

427
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:21,016

根据杰克·鲍尔所说  很准确
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very.

443

452
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:08,011
阿洛  安排一架无人机跟着直升机
Arlo, scramble a drone alongside the chopper.

453
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,069
全方位保护降落地点
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone

454
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,083
包括空中范围
as well as the air corridor.

455
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,060
明白
Done.

456
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,063
安全  快走
We're clear. Come on.

457
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,065
调度  我是2354组
Dispatch, this is unit 2354.

458
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:52,058
请讲  2354
Go ahead, 2354.

459
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,034
发现与被盗车辆牌照一致的车辆
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.

460
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:05,045
车牌号为S-N-E-1-5-C-5
Plate Sierra, November, Echo, one, five, Charlie, five.

461
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:08,028
车身和挡风玻璃上有弹孔
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body.

462
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,031
就是他
That's him.

463
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,082
收到  你的位置在哪
Roger that. What's your location?

464
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:14,076
车停在18大道  9大道西侧
Vehicle's parked on 18th, just west of Ninth Avenue.

465
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,071
我们会处理好
We'll take care of it.

466
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:18,004
你可以吗
Will you?

467
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,077
或者还是我亲自来动手
Or am I going to have to step in?

468
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,075
你最好现在就告诉我
Now would be the time to tell me.

469
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:26,065
阿鲁兹死定了
Aruz is a dead man, sir.

470
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,073
-我向你保证  -很好
- You have my word.  - Good.

471
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,021
谢谢
Thank you.

472
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,099
打扰了  总统阁下
Excuse me, madam president.

473
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:05,001
哈桑总统接受了我们关于监察的反提案
President Hassan accepted our counterproposals on inspections.

474
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,070
真是好消息啊
That is great news.

475
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,045
下一场会议结束时
By the end of this next session,

476
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:10,048
应该就能签订协议了
we may have a signed agreement.

477
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,044
此举成就不凡  艾莉森
It's an extraordinary accomplishment, Allison.

478
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:21,028
有什么问题吗
Is something wrong?

479
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,042
我在想亨利
I was thinking about Henry.

480
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:28,083
与伊斯兰共和国达成和平共识
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement with the Islamic Republic

481
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,033
是我和他多年前的共同梦想
was something that he and I talked about years ago.

482
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:37,048
真希望他能在此共襄盛举
I wish that he were here to share the moment.

483
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:42,071
你很惊讶吗
You surprised?

484
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:46,058
鉴于他要求离婚时的行为
Considering his behavior during the divorce,

485
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,011
是的  我很惊讶
Yes, I am surprised.

486
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,096
他做得太过分了
He went out of his way to hurt you,

487
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:51,015
尤其是在媒体面前
especially in the press.

488
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:52,046
他很生气  伊桑
He was angry, Ethan.

489
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:54,023
我把我们的女儿送进了监狱
I sent our daughter to prison.

490
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:56,066
你只是拒绝掩盖一起谋杀
You refused to cover up a murder.

491
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:59,043
奥利维亚理应为其行为负责
Olivia was responsible for what happened--

492
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,027
与他人无关
No one else.

493
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:03,026
但是  倘若我和他互换位置
Still, if the the situation had been reversed,

494
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,058
我可能也会和亨利一样
I might've felt the same way as Henry.

495
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:06,091
抱歉打扰了
Sorry if I'm interrupting,

496
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:08,093
反恐小组的布赖恩·黑斯廷斯来电
but I just talked to Brian Hastings at CTU.

497
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,013
出什么事了  罗伯
What's going on, Rob?

498
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,064
根据线人提供的情报显示
They have someone who claims he's got information

499
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,071
有人要刺杀哈桑总统
about an assassination plot on Hassan.

500
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,096
情报准确吗
How real is the threat?

501
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:16,006
准确到需要通知您
Real enough to loop you in.

502
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,022
情报是由杰克·鲍尔提供的
This informant came to them through Jack Bauer.

503
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,052
我以为杰克早就不干了
I thought that Jack was out of all of this.

504
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:21,057
他怎么卷进来了
How did he get involved?

505
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,044
据目前所知  是线人主动找到的他
As far as I can tell, this informant came to him.

506
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,053
如果您愿意签署豁免协议
We'll know more once the informant signs an immunity deal,

507
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,073
我们就能知道更多
provided you authorize it.

508
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:28,063
新闻发布会的场地安全系数如何
How secure is the venue for the press conference?

509
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:30,021
非常高  我刚提高了警戒级别
Very. And I just raised the alert level.

510
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,046
但我们要在会议开始之前
But we need to set up a call to inform Hassan about the threat,

511
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:33,085
及时电话告知哈桑
ideally before the conference gets started.

512
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:35,036
我们不能告诉哈桑
We can't tell Hassan.

513
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,090
至少要瞒到新闻发布会结束后
Certainly not before the press conference.

514
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,082
为什么
Why not?

515
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:42,051
他可能会出于自身安全考虑  弃协议而逃
Well, he might scuttle everything, out of concern for his own safety.

516
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,056
哈桑不是小孩子
Hassan's a big boy.

517
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,034
他经过大风大浪才有今天的地位
He's used to taking risks or he wouldn't be here;

518
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,035
这点你清楚
You know that.

519
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:49,032
况且  若哈桑发现我们瞒着他
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew about this and didn't tell him,

520
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:51,089
我们这一年来建立起的信任将毁于一旦
then all the trust we've built up over the last year goes out the window,

521
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,024
他必然会退出谈判
And then he'll pull out of talks.

522
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:55,007
坦白说  到时我不会怪他
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him.

523
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,035
我会好好考虑的
I'll think about it.

524
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:04,021
谢谢你们两位
Thank you both.

525
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,064
总统阁下  我要告诉你
Madam president, I'm telling you,

526
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:15,038
隐瞒哈桑的结果不堪设想
holding this back from Hassan could be disastrous.

527
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,025
我说了  我会考虑的  罗伯
I said I'd think about it, Rob.

528
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,077
谢谢
Thank you.

529
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,076
伊桑
Ethan...

530
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,099
抱歉  我刚才对你太冲了
Listen-- sorry if I went after you a little hard in there.

531
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,057
我只是阐明观点而已
I was just making my point.

532
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:48,060
不必道歉  罗伯
No need to apologize, Rob.

533
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,029
我之所以向总统举荐你
I recommended you to the president

534
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,047
就是因为你直言敢谏
because you're not afraid to speak up.

535
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,038
她需要这样的人
She needs that.

536
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,047
但我有时仍会过于激动  我...
Yeah, well, still, I know I can get carried away; I...

537
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,048
没关系  孩子  我还活得好好的
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet.

538
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,002
我了解自己的身体
I can handle myself.

539
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:06,067
和你对抗  也绰绰有余
Even up against you.

540
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,024
宝贝  是我
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

541
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:21,017
我们快收拾好了  你在路上了吗
Hey, we're almost finished packing. Are you on your way?

542
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:24,066
出了点状况  我要晚一点到了
Something came up. I'm gonna be a little late.

543
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:26,001
多晚
How late?

544
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,032
我们还是机场见吧
I think I should meet you at the airport.

545
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,025
没出什么事吧
Is everything okay?

546
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:30,041
没事
Yeah.

547
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,079
确定吗
Are you sure?

548
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,068
金  我保证一切都好
Kim, I promise everything's fine.

549
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,065
你要跟我们回来  泰瑞非常开心
Well, Teri is so excited that you're coming back with us.

550
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:39,043
你出发后  给我打个电话
Just, uh, let me know when you're on your way.

551
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:41,014
好的  谢谢  宝贝
Okay, thanks, sweetheart.

552
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:44,021
提高警惕
Keep your eyes open.

553
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,016
还差两个街区就到了
The precinct's two blocks away.

554
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,000
我们从这抄近道
Let's cut through here. Come on.

555
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,066
联邦航空局已清理出专用航线
The FAA's cleared a route

556
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:53,086
并已告知所有相关机构  我们即将起飞
and informed all relevant agencies that we will be in the air.

557
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:55,007
了解
Copy that.

558
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:56,036
好运
Good luck.

559
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,004
阿鲁兹的档案  在专用数据库里
Aruz's file-- it was in a proprietary database.

560
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,022
所以才会花这么久
That's why it took so long.

561
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,067
那也不该难倒你  你已经来了一个月了
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you-- you've been here a month.

562
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,065
不到一个月
Almost a month,

563
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:07,034
我需要重新熟悉每个主系统的接口
and I've had to relearn the interface on every major system here;

564
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,032
一切都不同了
everything's changed.

565
00:29:08,032 --> 00:29:10,053
你适应不顺利  我了解
And you're having trouble adapting, I understand.

566
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,021
我不怀疑你的智商
But I don't think it's a question of your intelligence.

567
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,016
谢谢
Thanks.

568
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:15,079
我认为你是在闹情绪
I think it's ambivalence.

569
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,093
闹情绪
Ambivalence?!

570
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:19,006
你来工作的唯一原因
I know the only reason you took this job

571
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,029
是你的丈夫被裁员了
was because your husband was downsized.

572
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,045
-我说错了吗  -不
- Am I wrong?  - No!

573
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,052
我是说  是的
I mean, yes.

574
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:28,058
求你了  再给我点时间跟上速度
Please, just give me a little more time to get up to speed here.

575
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:32,055
黑斯廷先生  我需要这份工作
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.

576
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,048
可以
Fair enough.

577
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:36,099
但我追求的是效率
But I'm all about efficiency,

578
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:38,043
若你的表现还是差强人意
so if your performance doesn't improve,

579
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,040
你最好三思  是否要待下去
You may want to rethink working here.

580
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:43,086
我想我说的已经够清楚了
Now, I trust this has been clarifying.

581
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,073
当然
Sure.

582
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:48,011
你真要效率的话
If you really wanted to be more efficient,

583
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,001
我若不尽快赶上进度  你就炒了我
If I don't catch up soon, I'm going to be fired?

584
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,059
你的航线是西南方向直航  越过河流
Your flight path is a straight shot southwest over the river,

585
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,093
12区已确认
and the 12th precinct has confirmed

586
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:05,001
停机坪安全可用
that their helipad is clear and operational.

587
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,037
全航线由通讯网和卫星双重覆盖
Comm net and satellite coverage of your flight, both legs,

588
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,095
还有无人机全程空中保护
and full-time aerial from the Drone

589
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:11,022
你干嘛这样看着我
why are you looking at me like that?

590
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,016
哪样
Like what?

591
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:17,015
我只是想确保万无一失
Look, I just want to make sure nothing's wrong.

592
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:20,033
如果所说  万无一失啊
Nothing's wrong, like I said.

593
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:23,072
小心点
Just be careful, okay?

594
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,082
会的
I will be.

595
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:26,055
准备好了吗
You ready?

596
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,058
嗯
Yeah.

597
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,058
我们出发吧
Let's go

598
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,049
你们该敲定个日子了
You know, maybe she should finally set a date.

599
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,002
她有点畏缩了
She's getting cold feet.

600
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:36,047
给我闭上你的嘴
How about you shut up

601
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,057
专心做好自己的工作
and just focus on your assignment?

602
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,012
撑住  维克多
Come on, Victor!
