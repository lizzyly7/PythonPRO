00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,050
《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:16,052
找到毒气罐了吗
Have you secured the canister?

3
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,087
阁下  恐怕还没有
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

4
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,069
我们的疑犯逃出了封锁线
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.

5
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,033
你们不是说封锁那区域了吗
I was told that the area was locked down.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,020
-怎么回事  -他有帮凶
- What happened? - He had help

7
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,083
是托尼·阿尔梅达
From Tony Almeida.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,083
阿尔梅达
Almeida?

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,087
他为我们做事的啊
He was working for us.

10
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,040
这只是表象
It only appeared that way.

11
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,087
他显然是在执行自己的计划
Apparently he was pursuing his own agenda,

12
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,084
想要弄到毒气罐
Trying to get his hands on the canister.

13
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:33,027
我们已召集所有人员重新部署寻找线索
We're all regrouping to develop leads.

14
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,071
我可能有一条线索
I may have one.

15
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:36,068
在霍奇斯被拘捕时
As hodges was taken into custody,

16
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,065
他叫嚣说  在他被捕后
He yelled at me about some larger group

17
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,095
还有更大的组织会继续行动
That would continue on after his arrest.

18
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:43,002
我们得跟他谈谈
We need to talk to him.

19
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,049
打电话给司法部长
I need you to call the attorney general

20
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:48,049
起草一份给乔纳斯·霍奇斯的证人保护协议
And draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges.

21
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,019
没有别的让他开口的法子了
There's no other way he'll talk.

22
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,056
你的亲生儿子死在他手里  更不要提
This man murdered your son, not to mention

23
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:54,090
数以百计的无辜平民
Hundreds of innocent civilians.

24
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,017
有什么我可以为你做的吗
Is there anything else that I can do for you?

25
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,084
杀了乔纳斯·霍奇斯之外  我别无他求
Other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,014
我不是这个意思
I didn't mean that.

27
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,044
你是对的
You know, you're right.

28
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,041
我们不该在电话里讨论这个
We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,074
你什么时候能到白宫
How soon can you be at the White House?

30
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,008
-15分钟怎么样  -很好
- How's 15 minutes sound? - Good.

31
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,035
我们计划在明年初
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks

32
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,085
对多个大城市发动同步攻击
Early next year in multiple cities,

33
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:17,085
公众就会意识到  政府无法保全他们
So the public would finally see that the government can't protect them.

34
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,032
他们会要求采取果断举措  我们就乘虚而入
They'd demand drastic measures, and we'd step in.

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,059
我们会支持那些想摧毁这个国家的敌人
We were going to supply the enemies that want to destroy this country.

36
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,099
张三李四王二麻子
Muhammed this, Achmed that.

37
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,090
霍奇斯先生  我要你说出同党的名字
Mr. Hodges, I need the names of the people that you are working with.

38
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:29,073
-我没有  -我要名单
- I don't have them. - I want the names.

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,003
我真不知道
I don't know any!

40
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,060
我们只需今天再发动一次袭击
Another attack today is all we need

41
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,050
就能让整个事态发展到崩溃的边缘
To push this thing right over the edge.

42
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,090
现在绝不是撤退的时候
This is no time to pull back.

43
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,027
我建议我们今天就拿着毒气罐
I say we take that canister

44
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:41,071
-去完成任务  -我联系一下组织
- And finish the job off today. - I'll contact the group.

45
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,001
这次行动会被归咎于这个人
The attack will be attributed to this man--

46
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,088
吉布安·阿尔扎利安
Jibraan Al-zarian.

47
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,062
我们讨论的是几个小时之内
We're talking about launching a new operation

48
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,012
展开一次新行动
In the next few hours

49
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,002
却只凭一个毒气罐
And with only one canister.

50
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,005
行动计划早就有了
The plan for this operation was already in place.

51
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,022
我们只不过是加快了点脚步
We'd just be accelerating the timetable.

52
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,072
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是一个我型我素的人
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,046
现在组织已经成功地除掉了他
And the group is well rid of him,

54
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,086
但他疯狂的行为  对我们倒不无益处
But, in his lunacy, he did us a favor.

55
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,096
我们要抓住这次机会
I say we take it.

56
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,007
哈米德
Hamid!

57
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,073
闭嘴就没事
Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt.

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,017
-明白了吗  -是的
- You understand?! - Yes!

59
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:12,034
以下情节发生在凌晨4点至5点间
The following takes place between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.

60
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,089
你还需要多久
How much more time do you need?

61
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,083
资料快下载完了
The material's almost finished downloading.

62
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,061
财务记录也准备好了
Financial records are in place.

63
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:52,058
我还需要15分钟来更改时间戳印
I'm gonna need about another 15 minutes to alter the time stamps.

64
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:55,062
很好
Good.

65
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:10,041
我现在把封条撕下来
I'm gonna take this off.

66
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,067
你要敢叫  你跟你弟弟就没命了
You yell for help, you and your brother die.

67
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,074
明白吗
Understand?

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,012
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

69
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,069
你们把宣扬伊斯兰圣战的东西放进我电脑
You're putting Jihadi propaganda on my computer.

70
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,093
还有这些武器  你们
These weapons-- you're...

71
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,000
你们想让我看起来像个恐怖分子
You're trying to make me look like a terrorist.

72
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,050
你们为什么要这样做
Why are you doing this?

73
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,090
吉布安  听我说
Listen to me, jibraan.

74
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:45,031
你只需要知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

75
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,048
如果你不照我说的做
If you don't do exactly as I say,

76
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:53,018
你会眼睁睁看着你弟弟死在你面前
You're going to watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes.

77
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:57,092
然后  我也会杀了你
And then... I'm gonna kill you.

78
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:03,072
但是  如果你合作
However... if you cooperate...

79
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:07,039
你们两兄弟有可能活下来
...there's a good chance the two of you will live through this.

80
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,030
你想要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

81
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,014
首先
First off...

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,027
你要面对摄像机念这段声明
You're going to read this statement in front of a camera,

83
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:20,004
要念得有诚意
And you're going to read it like you mean it.

84
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,004
不  这太扯淡了
No, this is insane.

85
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,004
我不能念这个
I can't read this.

86
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,038
我不干
I'm not going to do this.

87
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,055
好啊  听起来你好像觉得自己还有的选了
Okay, see, that sounds to me like you think you have a choice.

88
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,092
求你了  这样不对
Please, this is not right.

89
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,015
你不能这么对我们
You can't do this to us.

90
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,022
好吧
Okay, fine.

91
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,022
好  好  求你不要伤害他
Okay, okay, please, please don't hurt him.

92
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,076
我会照你说的做
I'll do whatever you say.

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,066
好吗
Okay?

94
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,094
给你5分钟把那看一遍
I'll give you five minutes to look that over.

95
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,082
我刚用反恐组服务器完成了第一次扫描

96
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,019
完全检测不到有什么活动或聊天记录
There's been no chatter, no activity at all.

97
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,086
你更新监视名单了吗

都已经在执法机构监视下了

100
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,036
如果有人要干点什么
If one of them was gonna do something,

101
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:18,070
我们早就发现了
We would know about it.

102
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,027
可恶  我们得扩大搜索范围
Damn, well, we're going to have to widen our parameter.

103
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,054
扩大到什么程度
To include what?

104
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:26,001
我要你检查华盛顿市区范围的所有穆斯林
I want you to check out every muslim in the Washington D.C. area.

目标是敏感职位的政府工作人员

或是可能受到袭击的区域的人员

然后调出在穆斯林社区工作的

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,048
所有政治活动家的档案

还有  联系移民规划局

110
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,085
我想要最近从伊斯兰国家来的移民名单

111
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,086
抱歉  有人听到种族成见的话了吗
Excuse me, has anybody heard of racial profiling?

112
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,096
詹尼斯  别说了

00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:48,006
不  她是对的
No, she's right.

114
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,010
你是对的  这是种族成见
You're right, this is racial profiling,

115
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,010
我跟你一样都不喜欢
And I don't like it any more than you do,

116
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,040
但霍奇斯明确告诉我
But Hodges told me specifically

117
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,024
他会利用穆斯林激进分子
That he was going to utilize muslim extremists

118
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,091
转移人们对这次袭击的责难对象
In an effort to offload the blame for this attack.

119
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,014
我得知道他的同党是谁
I need to know who he's working with,

120
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,038
我们没时间了
And we're running out of time.

121
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:05,025
我不知道还有什么更好的办法
I don't know a better way of doing this.

122
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,085

我忘了我要说的话了
I forgot what I was saying.

移民规划局记录  杰克
INS records, jack?

129
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:34,061
没错  先追查那些记录再逆向追踪
Yeah, run those down first and then work backwards.

130
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,068
失陪一下
Excuse me.

131
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:40,025
这是他第二次这样了
This is the second time he's done this.

132
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,098
他总是忘东西  脸色很差
He keeps forgetting things, he looks like hell.

133
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,095
这种情况下  他干得很不错了
He's doing pretty well, considering.

134
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,025
这种情况
Considering?

135

什么情况
Considering what?

136
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,029

告诉我什么
Tell me what?

138

现在就告诉我
Tell me now.

他感染了阮病毒变体
He was infected with the prion variant.

怎么感染的
How?

他当时想要夺回生化武器罐子

其中一个破裂了

他暴露在了毒气中

我的天哪
Oh, my god.

147
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:06,053
抱歉  克罗伊  他可能不想让你担心
I'm sorry, Chloe, he probably didn't want you to worry.

148
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,080
克罗伊
Chloe...

149
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,073
你为什么不告诉我你病了
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,063
这不要紧
It doesn't matter.

151
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,040
不要紧
It doesn't matter?

152
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,047
我是你朋友

我们发动这次袭击是为了

你有什么理由要对付他呢

我不知道你听到了多少风声

00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,070
我没有时间详细解释

你要知道的就是霍奇斯拿到了协议

我母亲批准了  然后他就会逍遥法外

-我能给你提点建议吗  -什么
- Okay, can I give you a little advice? - What?

304
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:35,039
这次玩大了  还是少管闲事为妙
This is big game. Walk away.

305
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,015
我做不到
I can't do that.

306
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,011
这一旦成为事实
Once this happens,

307
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,035
一旦你成功了  你将无法回头
Once it goes through, you can never go back.

308
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,075
这事会在你后半生中如影随形
You will live with it for the rest of your life.

309
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,033
我不用你来给我做良知问题的说教
I don't need a lecture on conscience from you,

310
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,068
不用你们所有人来教我
Of all people.

311
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,081
我已经过了深思熟虑
I have thought this through.

312
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,002
我所不能忍受的是
What I can't live with

313
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:00,028
那个恶魔逍遥法外
Is that monster getting away with this.

314
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:02,092
他要为他的所作所为付出代价
He has to pay for what he did.

315
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,028
那么霍奇斯现在在哪

当他走出那扇门时我们就再难对付他了
When he walks out that door, we lose him.

322
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,050
他会从此人间蒸发
He disappears forever.

323
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,063
一切要速战速决
This has got to happen fast.

如果您需要  就能有这项服务  先生

我是你肚里的蛔虫  孩子

00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,043
我已经一无所有

我的公司  我的家庭
My company, my family,

359
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,094

你明白要花多少血汗

才能使那名字永垂青史吗

00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,068
你干嘛  我们甚至不知道他们干了什么
What are you doing? We don't even know that they've done anything yet.

367
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,044
他们可能是无辜的
They could be innocent.

368
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,099
无辜的  你听到霍奇斯说的
Innocent? You heard Hodges.

369
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,021
他们会利用本土恐怖分子来进行这些袭击

370
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,006
阿尔扎利安可能不是今天发生

388
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,098
你们想干嘛
What do you want?

389
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,062
我们在找一个在这里朝拜的人
We're looking for a man who worships here.

390
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,079
我们怀疑他可能

00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:10,039
在协助进行另一起恐怖袭击
Helping to plan another attack

392

而且很快会在特区发生

他叫吉布安·阿尔扎利安

396
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:21,043
你们为什么怀疑他是恐怖分子呢
And why do you think he's a terrorist?

397
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,099
他符合一些犯罪特征的剖析
He fits a specific profile.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,077
你是说他是穆斯林
You mean, he is a muslim.

00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,058
他在移民表格中填的担保人是你

403
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:35,035
在哪里做礼拜是个人隐私  受法律保护

404
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,055
目前为止  找到阿尔扎利安

405
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,002
是阻止恐怖袭击的唯一方式

那么  我再问你一遍  你认识他吗
So, I ask you again, sir, do you know him?

00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,030
你凭什么这么肯定

吉布安向我讨教精神层面的问题很多次了

00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:04,041
他并不暴力  也不是极端分子
He is not violent and he is not an extremist.

414
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,044
可我们有证据表明他是
We have evidence that indicates otherwise.

415
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,088
我倒想看看你们所谓的证据
I would like to see this evidence.

416
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,008
听着
Listen to me.

417
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,065
我们来不是要和你争论这个问题
We did not come here to debate this with you.

418
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:11,098
他住在哪里
Where does he live?

419
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,042
我不知道他住哪里
I don't know where he lives.

420
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,009
-他在哪里上班  -我也不清楚
- Where does he work? - I don't know that, either.

421
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,025
鬼才会相信你
And I don't believe you!

422
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,092
那么我该相信你吗
But you expect me to believe you?

423
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,099
我看了你在参议院的听证会
I watched your hearing at the senate,

424
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,059
我知道你做过什么
I know what you have done.

425
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:24,063
所以你告诉我我为什么要相信你说的一切
So, tell me why should I believe anything you say to me?

426
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,013
首先  你别无选择
First because you don't have a choice.

427
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,007
其次  我告诉你的都是事实
Second, because I am telling you the truth!

428
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,084
事实就是你带着莫须有的消息
The truth is that you come into a house of worship

429
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,084
闯入我的礼拜堂
With information you should not have,

430
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:35,032
肆无忌惮的指控  没有合法文件  
An outrageous accusation, no legal warrant,

431
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:36,078
还威胁我
and threaten me.

432
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,098
我没有威胁你
I have not threatened you.

433
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,025
暂时还没
Not yet.

434
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,031
但我们都知道接下来会发生什么
But we both know where this is going.

435
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,068
如果你这么确定他是清白的
If you're so sure he's innocent,

436
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,022
-为什么不敢说他在哪里呢  -杰克
- Why are you afraid to tell us where he is? - Jack...

437
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,022
他在哪里
Where is he?!

438
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:49,009
我说过了  我不知道
I told you, I don't know.

439
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:53,036
即便我知道  我也不会说
But even if i did, I would say nothing.

440
00:22:53,043 --> 00:22:56,009
我不会帮助你们逮捕无辜的人
I would not help you arrest an innocent man.

441
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:00,030
我是沃克探员

00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:01,053
我是詹尼斯
It's Janis.

443

一名首府警察15分钟前

我们有阿尔扎利安的地址了

452
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:17,082
-杰克  我们走  -转过身去

453
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,038
-为什么  -我让你转过去

你在做什么  杰克
What are you doing, Jack?

456
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,009
我不会让他在我们到达前
I'm not letting him call Al-zarian

457
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,052
给阿尔扎利安通风报信的
Before we get there.

458
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,003
-他得跟我们一起去  -你没那个权利
- He's coming with us. - You have no right!

459
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:30,010
-我又没干坏事  -闭嘴
- I have done nothing wrong! - Shut up!

460
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:36,027
我们没有怜悯和宽恕  只有报仇雪恨
...there will be none, only our vengeance.

461
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:39,097
而这仅仅是个开始
And this is only the beginning.

462
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,037
我们会以崇高和正义之名
We will strike again and again

463
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:44,084
发动一次又一次的袭击
In the name of all that is great and righteous.

464
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:48,058
好  好吧
All right, fine.

465
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:51,008
运输队已经准备好  就等我们了

468
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,026

照我们讨论的说给他听
Tell him what we discussed.

472
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,060
去把他叫醒
Go ahead and wake him up.

473
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,024
求你了  我不能这么做
Please, I can't do this.

474
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:19,004
不  你能
Yes, you can.

475
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,045
你必须做
And you will.

476
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:23,028
我怎么知道你们事后不会杀了哈米德
How do I know you won't kill Hamid anyway?

477
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:26,012
因为我们还需要他告诉警察
Because we need him to tell the police

478
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,065
他哥哥是恐怖分子
That his brother's a terrorist.

479
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,046
相信我
Believe me,

你这么做是救了他

481
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,096
好了  快点  出发了
Now, come on, let's go.

482
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,024
哈米德  哈米德  别慌
Hamid, Hamid, calm down.

483
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,077
别怕
Don't be scared.

484
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,051
吉布安  怎么回事
Jibraan, what is this?

485
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,014
抱歉以这种方式对你
Sorry we had to do it this way.

486
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,091
可我们不会伤害你的  明白吗
But you're not going to be hurt anymore, okay?

487
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,001
我们  我们是谁
We? Who is we?

488
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,025
出什么事了
What's happening?

489
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:55,045
我来解释这一切  好吗
I'll explain everything to you, okay?

490
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,065
他是谁
Who's he?

491
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:01,075
他是我朋友
Um, he's a friend.

492

你朋友吗  你朋友我都认识
Your friend? I know all your friends.

493
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,029
可我从没见过他
I've never seen him before.

494
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,026
那是因为我没把他介绍给你
That's because I have kept him from you.

495
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:08,033
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

496
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,026
我得告诉你一些事情
I have to tell you something.

497
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:14,047
我其实不是你想的那样
I'm not the person you think I am.

498
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,027
什么
What?

499
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:20,004
我憎恨这个国家对我们的人民所做的一切
I hate what this country has done to our people.

500
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,001
我和这些人一起工作
And I'm working with these men.

501
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,064
他们会帮助我
They're going to help me strike back

502
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,061
向那些欺侮我们的恶势力发动反击
Against the evil that has been done to us.

503
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,008
反击
Strike back?

504
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,072
我不能透露更多的了
I can't say any more than that.

505
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:34,069
我不相信
I don't believe it.

506
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,006
这个国家收留我们  让我们安居于此
This country brought us in, gave us a home,

507
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,042
这才是你挂在嘴边的话
That's what you always said.

508
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:40,076
是的  但那是个谎言
Yeah, that was a lie.

509
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:44,070
我以前一直没告诉你我内心的愤怒
I have been protecting you from this rage I've always felt inside.

510
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,053
但现在是时候让你知道真相了
But now it is time for you to know the truth.

511
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,084
我们的父母死在美国人手上  哈米德
It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid.

512
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,067
我要让他们付出代价
I'm going to make them pay.

513
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:54,024
你对我哥做了什么
What have you done to my brother?

514
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:56,004
你给他洗脑了吗  这根本就不是我哥
You've poisoned his mind! This isn't my brother!

515
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,031
他们并没对我做什么
They have not done anything to me, okay.

516
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,098
重要的是你得明白我说的话
It is very important you accept what I'm saying to you.

517
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,038
你干嘛要告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this?

518
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:06,002
若有人问你我的动机
When they ask you why I did what I did,

519
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,072
我希望你能告诉他们
I want you to tell them.

520
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,076
没人会怪你的
Okay, no one will blame you for anything.

521
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:13,023
你并没有做错
You have done nothing wrong.

522
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:19,060
我知道你很难理解这一切
I know this is very difficult for you to understand.

523
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,007
但以后你会明白的
But over time, you will see.

524
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,081
我爱你  哈米德
I love you, Hamid.

525
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:42,062
你说今天当一个穆斯林是糟糕的一天
You said today was a bad day to be a muslim.

526
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,056
现在看来  当你弟弟更加糟糕
Well, it's an even worse day to be your brother.

527
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,013
好了  该走了
All right, let's go.

528
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,057
集结待命地区准备好了

529
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:56,000
你留下来处理一下
You stay here and finish up.

00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,027
知道了
Understood.

531
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,034
吉布安  不要这样做
Jibraan, don't do this.

532
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:02,084
一切就绪了吗
Everything set?

533
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:05,064
他弟弟相信了吗
Yeah, was the brother convinced?

534
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:06,091
还不确定
I'm not sure.

535
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,038
即便他不相信
But even if he wasn't,

536
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:10,062
袭击一旦发生  他就会相信的
Once the attack happens, he will be.

537
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:12,068
走吧
Let's go.

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,000
喂
Hello?

539
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:39,006
喂

All right, but what are you--

553
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:32,048
请进
Yes?

554
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,049
打扰一下  泰勒女士
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

555
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:37,032
你父亲要见你
I thought you should know your father has asked to see you.

556
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,059

考虑到可能的生化武器袭击

杰克  我是克罗伊  我发现

572
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:58,067
吉布安·阿尔扎利安的事有些蹊跷
Weird about these hits on Jibraan Al-zarian.

573
00:29:58,074 --> 00:29:59,080
说下去
Go ahead.

574
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,041
我告诉过你他的账户
You know how I said that the two million dollars

575
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,074
在6个月内
Was deposited into his account

576
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,004
总共存入了2百万美元
Over a period of six months?

577
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,071
那不对  时间被提前了
Well, that wasn't right. They were backdated.

578
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:07,011
什么意思
What do you mean?

579
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,031
一种回溯算法捕捉到了一个差异
One of the trace algorithms caught a discrepancy,

580
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,002
那些钱实际上是在30分钟前存入的
All that money was really just deposited 30 minutes ago.

581
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,092
他浏览过的那些极端分子网站呢
What about the extremist websites he was visiting?

582
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:15,099
时间标记也是一样的情况
Same thing with the time stamps.

583
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,002
网站访问时间是在30分钟前被修改提前的
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

584
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,003
你完全肯定吗
Are you absolutely positive?

585
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,083
看起来是这样
It looks that way.

586
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,030
吉布安很可能是无辜的
Jibraan could be innocent.

587
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:25,050
知道了  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

588
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,087
杰克  什么事
What's going on, Jack?

589
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:30,020
克罗伊找到证据表明吉布安是被陷害的
Chloe found evidence that Jibraan is being set up.

590
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,007
被人栽赃了
He's been framed.

591
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,041
阿尔梅达为什么要嫁祸一个无辜的人
Why would Almeida frame an innocent man?

592
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,071
因为一旦袭击不顺利
Because they wouldn't want to risk the attack

593
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,087
他们冒不起那个险
Not being carried out properly.

594
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,028
我怎么这么笨呢
How could I be so stupid?

595
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:41,065
一个无辜的人更容易掌控
An innocent man is so much easier to control.

596
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,032
他们需要的只是一个穆斯林
All they needed was a muslim,

597
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,022
他们可以给他伪造任何背景
They could create whatever background they wanted.

598
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,046
把手给我
Give me your hands.

599
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,096
我很吃惊
I am surprised.

600
00:30:54,003 --> 00:30:56,036
为什么  你是对的
Why? You were right.

601
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,050
不是关于吉布安
Not about Jibraan.

602
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,080
就我对当局的经验来看
My experience with the authorities,

603
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:02,006
警方一定会使出浑身解数
The police is that they will go to any lengths

604
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,030
对他们的错误矢口否认
Not to admit they were wrong.

605
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:07,019
即使是以牺牲一个无辜生命为代价
Even at the expense of an Innocent man's life.

606
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:10,044
至少你没有这么做
At least you didn't do that.

607
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,098
请明白我原谅你了
Please know that I forgive you.

608
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,098
我不是在祈求你的谅解

武装分子在里屋  持有一名人质

729
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,053
有阿尔梅达的消息吗

00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,063
他不在里面
He's not in there.

731

735
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:26,008
不是
No.

736
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:28,025
那是吉布安的弟弟  哈米德
That's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

737
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,079
他们以他来要挟  要求吉布安
They're using him as leverage, to make Jibraan

738
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,099
听他们的话
Do what they want.

739
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,001
因为若是我也会这么干
'cause that's what I would've done.

740
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,046
探员  一定要确保人质安全

现在  他是我们找到

What?

750
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:54,014
鲍尔探员  他看起来不太好

751

-也许该你来指挥  -我正在指挥

杰克被生化武器感染了
Jack was infected with the bioweapon.

753
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:04,059
就是他们准备用来袭击的那种武器
The same one that they are going to use in this attack.

754
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,075
那么他应该留在医院里

755
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:07,022
没有治疗方法的
There is no treatment.

756

他可能没有一天的命可活

757
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,092
如果他足够坚强的话  相信我

我已经进入了主要安全线路了

788
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,080
但我仍在迂回破解  确保
But I'm still looping in breakers to make sure

789
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,030
