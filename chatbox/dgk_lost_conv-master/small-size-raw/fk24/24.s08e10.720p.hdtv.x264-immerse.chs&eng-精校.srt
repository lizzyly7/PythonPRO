我不想再见到你们中任何一个
I don't want to see either one of you ever again.

5
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,063
能照办吗
Do we have a deal or not?

6
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,051
我们照办就是了
Yeah, we got a deal.

7
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,024
跟着他
I'm going after him.

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,040
我们该收手了
We're done.

9
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,072
我们才刚刚开始呢
We're just getting started.

10
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,099
珍妮
Jenny!

11
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:37,027
我们得谈谈你拘捕塔林的问题
We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested.

12
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,026
我知道塔林是你的朋友
I know you consider Tarin a friend.

13
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,074
我们不止是朋友
We are more than friends.

14
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:42,090
我们相爱了
We're in love.

15
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,034
你一直都背着我在和这个男人...
You've been carrying on with this man...

16
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:47,078
交往吗
behind my back?

17
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,046
这些都是什么人  萨米尔
Who are these men, Samir?

18
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,094
都是我招募的手下
These are men I have recruited.

19
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,099
我们无法把浓缩铀棒运出这个国家
We can't get the rods out of the country,

20
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,084
那只好做成核弹了
so let's use them as a radiological bomb.

21
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,076
要给美国佬点颜色看看
Then we'll show the Americans how strong we are.

22
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,011
到这边来
Over here!

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,038
有人在追杀我
There are people chasing me.

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,077
你们要找的浓缩铀棒就在他们手里
They have the rods you are looking for.

25
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,030
我还以为在你手里
I thought you had the rods.

26
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:11,056
他们出尔反尔
They turned against me.

27
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,020
快来救我出去
Just get me out of here.

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,074
我们会来救你的  哈桑先生
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

29
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:16,065
如果事情搞得一发不可收拾
When things get this colossally screwed up

30
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,097
总得有个替罪羊
people look for someone to blame.

31
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,013
那你怎么想的
So what have you got in mind?

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,053
蕾妮·沃克  杀了能为我们提供主要线索的人
Renee Walker-- she killed one of our main leads.

33
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:24,033
你是叫我起诉一个自愿为祖国
You're talking about a woman who put her life on the line

34
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,071
出生入死的的女人吗
when she didn't have to.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,034
总得有人来背这个黑锅吧  布赖恩
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian.

36
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:30,021
我从司法部派了个人来  克蕾丝丁·史密斯
I'm sending someone over from Justice-- Kristin Smith.

37
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,083
一切由她来处理
She'll take care of everything.

38
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,086
他们在陷害你  一句话也别说
They're setting you up-- don't say another word.

39
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:38,096
审讯结束了  我们离开这里
This is over. We're leaving now.

40
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,005
举起手来
Hands in the air.

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,059
-你愿意营救法哈德吗  -对
- You offering to bring in Farhad? - Yes.

42
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:48,025
条件是你撤销对蕾妮·沃克的刑事调查
If you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker.

43
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,047
如果我们要达成协议  杰克
If we do this, Jack,

44
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,070
这就不仅是为一次救援行动了
it's not for one rescue operation,

45
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,061
而是得把整件事都圆满了结
it's till this whole thing is over and done.

46
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:02,098
以下事件发生于凌晨一点至两点间
The following takes place between 1:00 A.M. and 2:00 A.M.

47
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,089
我们马上要把他押送到大使馆
We're about to transport him to the embassy.

48
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,016
你只有两分钟时间
You have two minutes.

49
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,060
谢谢
Thank you.

50
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,017
巴希尔  让他们单独待会儿
Bashir, clear the room.

51
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,032
塔林  他们伤害你了吗
Tarin, did they hurt you?

52
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,024
暂时还没
Not yet.

53
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,010
不过到了大使馆就不好说了
They won't until they get me to our embassy.

54
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,063
我试着和我父亲理论
I tried to reason with my father,

55
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,080
但他充耳不闻
but he wouldn't listen.

56
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:37,031
他认为你和他弟弟有牵连
He thinks you're involved in the conspiracy with his brother.

57
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:41,020
即便他得知我们相爱的事  他还是不信你
Even after I told him about us, he doesn't trust you.

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,037
你告诉了他我们相爱的事
You told him about us?

59
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:44,030
我还指望他能回心转意
I hoped it would change his mind.

60
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:47,046
但事与愿违  情况变得更糟了
But if anything, it's made things worse between us.

61
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,003
近几步说话
Come closer.

62
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,020
听我说  凯拉
Listen to me, Kayla,

63
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:59,054
我有一个办法能脱身
there is a way out of this.

64
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,019
我手下还有几个人对我忠心耿耿
There are a few men still loyal to me--

65
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,067
巴希尔就是其中之一
Bashir is one of them.

66
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,022
他答应助我脱逃
He's agreed to help me escape.

67
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,084
一有机会  巴希尔就会悄悄把手铐钥匙塞给我
As soon as he's able, Bashir will slip me a handcuff key,

68
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,079
他还在车里为我藏了一把枪
and he's placed a gun in the car for me to find.

69
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,030
不会有人受伤吧
You won't hurt anyone?

70
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,083
枪是万不得已的选择
The gun is so I won't have to.

71
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,055
我一旦脱身  我有藏身之地
Once I'm free, I have a place to stay

72
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,033
直到得到美国政府的政治庇护
until the Americans grant me asylum.

73
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:19,097
凯拉  我想让你和我一起走
Kayla... I want you to come with me.

74
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:22,017
来西奥多酒店与我会合
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.

75
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,013
答应我你一定会来
Promise me you'll come.

76
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:28,043
塔林  得走了
Tarin, we need to go.

77
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,092
科尔  他死了
Cole, he's dead!

78
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,000
走吧
Just go.

79
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,027
什么
What?

80
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,048
你走吧
Just go.

81
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,020
没人会知道你与此事有关
Nobody knows you had anything to do with this.

82
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,060
都是我的错
It's my fault.

83
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,019
我是谁  我做过些什么
I lied about everything.

84
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,034
我满嘴谎言
Who I am, what I've done.

85
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,050
我会报警的
I'll call the police.

86
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,045
一切后果都是我应得的下场
I deserve to take the blame for this.

87
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:18,094
事已至此
What's done is done.

88
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,060
我们把这里清理干净
We're cleaning this up,

89
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,013
没人会知道发生了什么
and no one's ever gonna know what happened.

90
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,019
我不想让你趟这滩浑水
I don't want you involved.

91
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,018
我已经泥足深陷了
I'm already involved.

92
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:29,069
我们把他的车牌处理掉  这样就不会被查到
We're gonna strip down his van so it can't be I.D.'d.

93
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,071
把尸体丢弃在沼泽地里
We'll dump the bodies in the swamp.

94
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:38,010
他们是人渣  丹娜  没人会想念他们
They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em.

95
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,018
你想下半辈子都待监狱里吗
You want to go to prison for the rest of your life?

96
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,010
就为了这两个人渣
For them?!

97
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,011
把车启动起来
Get started on the van.

98
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,009
我去把另外一具尸体搬过来
I'll go get the other one.

99
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,073
黑斯廷斯先生  总统在线上
Mr. Hastings, the president's on the line.

100
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,098
谢谢  我是黑斯廷斯
Thank you. This is Hastings.

101
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,098
黑斯廷斯先生  我和罗伯特·维斯在一起
Mr. Hastings, I'm here with Rob Weiss.

102
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,070
你有紧急情况要汇报吗
I was told you have urgent news.

103
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,088
我们接到一个来自法哈德·哈桑的电话
We received a call from Farhad Hassan.

104
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:05,015
是的  我们怀疑他正试图
Yes. As we suspected, he was trying

105
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,038
把浓缩铀棒运出美国
to smuggle the nuclear rods out of the country.

106
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,064
和他一伙的人对他起了异心
The people he's working with have turned against him.

107
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,026
-接着说  -法哈德认为
- What do we know? - Well, Farhad believes

108
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,079
他们打算把浓缩铀棒改造成核弹
they want to use the rods to construct a dirty bomb

109
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:17,008
而且就打算在纽约引爆
and set it off somewhere here in New York City.

110
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,099
他们为什么要这么做
Why would they do this?

111
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,063
在哈桑总统和反恐组的双重压力之下
Between Hassan's crackdowns and CTU,

112
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:23,013
他们已经走投无路了
we've backed them into a corner.

113
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,062
他们打算狗急跳墙了
This is their response.

114
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:25,081
你相信法哈德说的吗
Do you believe him?

115
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:27,000
我信
Yes, I do.

116
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,077
法哈德打算自首
Farhad is turning himself in.

117
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,093
他答应协助我们阻止这次恐怖袭击
He's agreed to help us prevent this attack.

118
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,019
法哈德现在在哪
Where is Farhad now?

119
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,007
在一个仓库里
He's in a warehouse

120
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,045
就在郊区接近森林山一带
just outside the city near Forest Hills.

121
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:38,013
我已指派杰克·鲍尔前去营救他了
I've enlisted Jack Bauer to lock him down.

122
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,011
总统阁下
Now, Madam President,

123
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,065
现在已经确认背叛法哈德的那伙人
the men who turned against Farhad

124
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:43,006
就是伊斯兰共和国的间谍
are covert assets for the I.R.K.

125
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,085
如果我们能拿到伊斯兰共和国的情报人员文件
Now, if we can get access to the I.R.K. intelligence files,

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,052
那法哈德也许能帮助我们指认这些人
Farhad may be able to help us I.D. these men.

127
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:51,091
那样的话  我们要追踪他们就容易多了
It will put us that much closer to tracking them down.

128
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,030
那些文件是哈桑总统情报活动的命脉
Those files are the lifeblood of Hassan's intelligence operation--

129
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,073
他绝对不会交出来
he'll never hand them over.

130
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:58,050
尤其在他目前这种心理状态下
Especially in his current frame of mind.

131
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,017
他都已经开始走极端了
Hell, the man's gone off the deep end.

132
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,070
也许他弟弟的消息能让他不再那么极端
Well, maybe this will pull him out of it.

133
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,071
告诉哈桑  我们已经找到他的弟弟了
Tell Hassan we have found his brother

134
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,002
我需要立即和他谈谈
and I need to speak to him immediately.

135
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,022
联系国土安全局的蒂姆·伍兹
And contact Tim Woods at Homeland.

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,022
让他整理出一份简报
Have him put together a briefing.

137
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,062
天佑吾民  但要是袭击还是发生了
I need to know exactly what we're facing

138
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,093
我要确切知道我们的处境
if, God forbid, this attack happens.

139
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:17,002
谢谢  黑斯廷斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

140
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,032
我马上去会议室
I'll be in the counsel chamber.

141
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,042
好的  总统阁下
Yes, Madam President.

142
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,033
维斯先生
Mr. Weiss.

143
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,091
什么事
Yeah?

144
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,091
你说吧
Yeah. What is it?

145
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,097
我想让你知道我已经决定
I want to let you know that I've decided

146
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,089
取消对蕾妮·沃克的指控了
not to pursue charges against Renee Walker.

147
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,029
什么
What?

148
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:37,006
为什么  我不是告诉过你...
Why not? I told you...

149
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,040
比起让蕾妮·沃克背黑锅
We have a lot more to worry about

150
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:40,005
我们现在还有更重要的事操心
right now than blaming Walker.

151
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,054
若非她杀了能为我们提供宝贵线索的人
Walker murdered a valuable lead

152
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,062
我们或许早就找到浓缩铀棒了
that might have gotten us to those nuclear rods.

153
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,039
你没听懂我说的
You're not hearing me.

154
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:48,009
我们现在有新线索了  法哈德·哈桑
We have a new lead now-- Farhad Hassan--

155
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,006
我正在追查此线索
and that is what I am pursuing.

156
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:53,097
你如果想撤我的职  悉听尊便
You want to replace me as head of CTU, be my guest.

157
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,051
如果不是的话
But until you do,

158
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,068
那就别挡道
stay the hell out of my way.

159
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,015
-黑斯廷斯  你正在犯... -杰克一到
- Hastings, you're making... - I'll let you know

160
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,025
法哈德那  我会通知你的
when Bauer reaches Farhad.

161
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,077
好了  法哈德的方位已被锁定
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located

162
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,050
就在仓库的东北角
on the northeast corner of the warehouse.

163
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,026
我们必须行动迅速  因为他身上有伤
We're gonna have to move fast, because he's injured.

164
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,066
金  林奇  你们从南面包抄
King, Lynch, you're gonna go in from the south.

165
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,045
欧文和我掩护你们的侧翼
Owen and I will cover your flank.

166
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:24,016
-明白  -我们一救出他
- Understood. - As soon as we've got him locked down,

167
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,069
就要马上开始审讯
we're gonna initiate our interrogation.

168
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,059
反恐组会上传嫌犯的资料
CTU's gonna upload files on probable suspects--

169
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,065
我希望电脑能尽快接收
I need that available and on a computer as soon as possible.

170
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,055
是  长官
Yes, sir.

171
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:32,068
鲍尔先生  我们接到从反恐组转接来的电话
Mr. Bauer, we're getting a call routed through CTU.

172
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,092
是法哈德·哈桑
It's Farhad Hassan.

173
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,001
打开免提
Put it on speaker.

174
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,091
我是杰克·鲍尔  请讲
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead.

175
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,050
你们还有多久到
How close are you?

176
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,002
十分钟吧  你还好吗
Ten minutes out. Are you okay?

177
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,064
有人来了
There's someone here.

178
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,040
他们很接近我了
They're close.

179
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,091
他们在找我
They're looking for me.

180
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,020
求你了  快点
Please... hurry.

181
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,064
总统阁下
Madam President.

182
00:07:58,038 --> 00:07:59,064
有人告诉我您已经找到我弟弟了
I'm told you have my brother.

183
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,014
请坐
Please.

184
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:07,009
他给反恐组打了电话
He called CTU

185
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,063
并且自首了
and surrendered himself.

186
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,054
我不明白
I don't understand.

187
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,067
和法哈德一伙的那帮人背叛了他
The men that Farhad was working with turned against him,

188
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,021
现在浓缩铀棒在他们手里
and they have taken the nuclear rods.

189
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,074
法哈德认为他们打算改造成一枚核弹
Now, he believes that they intend to construct a dirty bomb

190
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,024
并在纽约引爆它
to attack this city.

191
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,008
很显然  这伙人就是贵国派来美国
Now, apparently, these men are members of

192
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:25,048
从事秘密情报活动的间谍
your covert intelligence operations here in the United States.

193
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,098
这难以信服
I find that hard to believe.

194
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:29,067
您弟弟没理由撒谎
Well, your brother has no reason to lie.

195
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:32,025
他选择了自首  就是选择了死刑
By turning himself in, he's facing the death penalty.

196
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,067
所以我们认为他说的是实话
We have to assume he's telling the truth.

197
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:38,015
我需要您把您派来我国的
I need for you to give us intelligence files

198
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,087
所有间谍的文件都交给我们
for every asset you have in this country

199
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:44,010
这样法哈德就能指认这些恐怖份子
so Farhad can identify these terrorists.

200
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:48,058
总统阁下  我给了您很大的回旋余地
Mr. President, I have given you a great deal of latitude

201
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,094
来让您处理国内的局势
to sort out your domestic situation,

202
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,050
现在我的国家安全受到了威胁
and now there is a threat to my homeland,

203
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,061
而我需要您的配合
and I need your cooperation.

204
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,096
我建议您把法哈德交给我处置
I suggest you turn Farhad over to me

205
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:00,070
让我的人来审问他
and let my people question him.

206
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,089
我们会找出您要的答案
We'll get the answers you need.

207
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,066
没那么多时间了
There's no time for that.

208
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:06,003
此刻  反恐组小队已前去营救法哈德了
There's a CTU team moving on Farhad as we speak.

209
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,066
他们要就地审问他
They need to question him on site.

210
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,065
我需要这些文件
I need the files.

211
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:12,044
您的要求会对我国的安全造成严重危害
What you're asking is a serious breach of our security.

212
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,012
这个我很清楚
I understand that.

213
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,046
但我也请您明白
But you need to understand

214
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:18,038
如果核袭击一旦发生
that if this radiological attack takes place,

215
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:20,068
我将不得不发动反击
I will be forced to retaliate.

216
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:26,061
您是说会进攻我的国家
You would attack... my country?

217
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,004
我将别无选择
I will have no choice.

218
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:34,095
我需要那些文件
I need those files...

219
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,053
而且现在就要
and I need them now.

220
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,087
我会通知我的代理安全主管
I'll call my acting head of security.

221
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,017
几分钟内您就会拿到文件
You'll get the files in a few minutes.

222
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:50,000

Thank you.

我不相信你会叛国

00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,061
你知道到哪去找我们
You know where to find us.

304
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,095
是的
Yes.

305
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:37,070
鲍尔先生
Mr. Bauer.

306
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,044
-说吧  -他腹部中了两枪  大口径子弹
- Speak to me. - We have two large caliber slugs to the abdomen.

307
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,013
他正严重失血  可能撑不到医院了
He's bleeding out. I don't think he's going to make it to the hospital.

308
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,055
不惜一切稳定住他的伤势
Do whatever you have to do to stabilize him.

309
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,052
我们现在就得和他谈了  快去
We need to talk to him now. Go!

310
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,079
我是B组
This is B team.

311
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,093
发现了他们的货车  但没发现浓缩铀棒
We found their truck, but there's no sign of the rods.

312
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,063
文件上传完毕立即通知我
Let me know as soon as these files are uploaded.

313
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,065
哈桑先生  过会儿
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds,

314
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:13,047
我会给你看几张你们国家
I'm going to show you photographs of covert operatives

315
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,012
潜伏在美国的间谍的照片
working for your country within the United States.

316
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,055
我要你指认出那些从你这里偷走浓缩铀棒的人
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you.

317
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,022
你能帮助我们吗
Can you do that for us?

318
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,040
好的
Yes.

319
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,092
文件上传好了吗
Are those files uploaded yet?!

320
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,023
-就快了  -再快点
- Almost. - Come on!

321
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,039
血压降低  心跳加剧
Blood pressure's dropping. We've got a rapid heartbeat.

322
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,023
出什么事了
What the hell's happening?

323
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,011
他要休克了  给我20毫升肾上腺素
He's going into shock. Give me 20 cc's epinephrine.

324
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,073
你要让他活着  听明白了吗
You keep that man alive, do you understand me?

325
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,035
-救活他  -别干扰我救人
- Keep him alive!  - Let me do my job!

326
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,084
-视频会议准备好了  总统阁下  -谢谢
- The telepresence conference is ready, Madam President. - Thank you.

327
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,057
很高兴见到你们  先生们
Good to see you, gentlemen.

328
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:55,008
总统阁下  反恐组的布赖恩·黑斯廷斯
Madam President, Brian Hastings at CTU

329
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:56,010
向我们汇报了最新情况
has brought us up to speed,

330
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,007
我们准备让您了解一下详情
and we're ready to review some specifics with you.

331
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,039
很好  愿闻其详
Good. I'm listening.

332
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,007
请您看一下屏幕
If you would refer to your monitor...

333
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,065
这是曼哈顿市中心的平面图
and the diagram of Midtown Manhattan.

334
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,022
据反恐组汇报
According to CTU,

335
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:10,024
失窃的浓缩铀棒最高可能有三百磅的爆炸当量
the stolen nuclear rods have a maximum explosive yield of 300 pounds.

336
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:12,010
并且有足够的辐射物质
That's enough radiological material

337
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,042
污染大约一平方英里的区域
to contaminate approximately one square mile.

338
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:18,096
如果爆炸装置在曼哈顿人口更为密集的区域引爆
If the device were detonated in a more densely populated area of Manhattan,

339
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:21,092
伤亡可能会达到数万人
we could be looking at casualties in the tens of thousands.

340
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,086
兰德里博士
Dr. Landry?

341
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:28,047
大多数遇难者会死于严重的辐射中毒
Most of the deaths would be from severe radiation poisoning.

342
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,061
剩下的受害者会死于辐射导致的并发症
The remainder of the victims would expire from radiation induced illnesses.

343
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,076
主要是白血病
Primarily leukemia

344
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,019
还有其他癌症
and other cancers.

345
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,074
我们还要考虑到受辐射污染的区域
We also have to consider that the affected area

346
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:40,001
将在未来大约四十年内不适于居住
would be rendered uninhabitable for approximately 40 years.

347
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:42,087
显然不能考虑全城疏散
Obviously a citywide evacuation is out of the question.

348
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,021
是的  有上百万人居住在这个
That's right. There are millions of people on this island

349
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,048
交通极为不便的岛上
with few points of egress.

350
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,026
全部疏散需要几天时间
It would take days to get them out.

351
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,093
更别说将这个消息公之于众
Not to mention that going public with this information

352
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,028
会引起的巨大恐慌了
would cause mass panic.

353
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:54,084
我同意  我们暂时要对公众隐瞒这个危机
I agree. We need to keep this threat from the public for now.

354
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:57,092
集中全力阻止袭击的发生
Focus our efforts on making sure that this attack never happens.

355
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:00,060
反恐组确信浓缩铀棒还在城区之外
CTU believes the nuclear rods are still outside the city,

356
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,096
所以他们正加强桥梁和隧道的辐射探测力度
so they're fortifying radiation detection efforts at the bridges and tunnels.

357
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,019
我们也在加强对重要目标的保护
We are also hardening high value targets

358
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,052
比如金融区  地标性建筑和地铁
such as the financial district, landmarks, subways.

359
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:12,011
联合国大楼也可能是目标之一
But we can't ignore that the U.N. may also be a target.

360
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,082
考虑到安全问题  我认为应该疏散整栋大楼
Given the danger, I think we should evacuate the entire building.

361
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,059
在一个安全地点重新召开此次会议
We can resume the conference from a safe location.

362
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:24,056
好吧  通知代表们目前的情况
All right, inform the delegates of the situation.

363
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,054
总统阁下
Madam president

364
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:37,067
反恐组抓获了您的弟弟
CTU has your brother in custody.

365
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,007
他中枪了
He's been shot.

366
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,013
他们正全力抢救他
They're trying to stabilize him.

367
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:43,043
说
Yes?

368
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,047
总统阁下  拉希姆探员打来电话
Sir, Agent Rahim is calling for you.

369
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,047
他说他找到了纳比尔
He says he's located Nabeel.

370
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,020
接通他
Put him through.

371
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:49,034
是  总统阁下
Yes, sir.

372
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,068
总统阁下  我们找到了纳比尔和他的司机
Mr. President, we found Nabeel and his driver

373
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,039
他们被锁在车的后备箱里
locked down in the back of their vehicle.

374
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,094
-塔林逃跑了  -什么
-Tarin has escaped.  - What?!

375
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:56,089
纳比尔要和您通话  总统阁下
Nabeel wishes to speak to you, sir.

376
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,064
好的  让他接电话
Yes, okay, put him on.

377
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,093
抱歉  总统阁下
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

378
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:05,077
塔林身上有枪
Tarin had the gun with him.

379
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,017
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't understand how.

380
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:09,064
你是说有人协助他逃跑吗
Are you saying somebody helped him escape?

381
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:11,020
我觉得是
It would seem so.

382
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,039
但总统阁下
But Mr. President,

383
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,050
还有件事我要告诉您
there's something else you need to know.

384
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,025
他脱身后  我偷听到塔林在打电话
Right after he escaped, I overheard Tarin on the phone.

385
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,002
我想他在和您女儿通话
I believe he was speaking to your daughter.

386
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:30,038
凯拉  你确定吗
Kayla? Are you sure about this?

387
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,022
是的  总统阁下
Yes, sir.

388
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:34,084
听上去他要去城里的一个地方见她
It sounded like he was going to meet her somewhere in the city.

389
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:00,032
凯拉  给我回电话
Kayla, call me back.

390
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,022
回电话  凯拉
Call me back, Kayla.

391
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,087
进来
Come inside.

392
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,048
谢天谢地你没事
Oh, thank God, you're all right.

393
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,062
我联系了一位我认识的美国律师
I contacted an American lawyer I know

394
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,068
他是国际法方面的专家
who's an expert at international law.

395
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,084
他答应两个小时内见我们
He's agreed to meet us in two hours.

396
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,030
虽然目前情况很糟糕
This is such a terrible situation.

397
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,038
但我却从未如此高兴过
Yet I've never felt so happy.

398
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,009
我也一样
I feel the same.

399
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:56,065
鲍尔先生  我们尽力了
Mr. Bauer, we did our best.

400
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:58,002
他没撑过去
He didn't make it.

401
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,019
我知道你尽力了  谢谢
I know you did. Thanks.

402
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,094
我们搜查了整个区域  长官  没人了
We swept the area, sir. It's clear.

403
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,001
没有敌人和浓缩铀棒的踪迹
No hostiles. No trace of the nuclear rods.

404
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,024
明白
Copy that.

405
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,061
反恐组  我是鲍尔
CTU, this is Bauer.

406
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,026
法哈德死了
We lost him. Farhad's dead.

407
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:09,020
该死
Damn it.

408
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,067
我认为我们还有别招可用
I still think we've got another play.

409
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,077
对法哈德开枪的人无法确定他是否死了
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed.

410
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,041
我们从半路杀出来
We came up on him too fast.

411
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,038
他们不知道他伤得有多么严重
They don't know how badly he was wounded.

412
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,071
那么你有何高见  杰克
So what are you proposing, Jack?

413
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,001
我的意思是用法哈德作为诱饵
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait.

414
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:22,028
给媒体放话说我们抓获了他
Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody,

415
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,008
而且他还活着
and he survived.

416
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,077
我们正把他送往当地一家医院
We're transporting him to a local hospital

417
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:26,004
当局会在那里对他进行审问
where authorities are going to question him.

418
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,019
他们不得不再次对他下手
They'll have to make a move on him.

419
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,062
他知道的太多了  
He knows too much.

420
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,080
像是死马当活马医了
Sounds like a Hail Mary.

421
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,006
这是我们目前唯一的救命稻草了
Right now it's the only play we've got.

422
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,006
如果不出我所料  他们对法哈德下手
But if they make a move on Farhad, which I think they will,

423
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,043
我们就可以守株待兔
we'll be waiting for them.

424
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,070
黑斯廷斯  你说过在事情完全平息前
Mr. Hastings, you said you wanted me in

425
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:38,053
你要我全力以赴  这就是证明
till this was resolved. This is it.

426
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,030
我们拿到了哈桑情报人员的文件
We have Hassan's intelligence files.

427
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:43,017
我们可以用面部识别系统进行扫描和交叉比对
We can scan and cross-reference with facial recognition software.

428
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,057
说不定能在袭击之前找到这些恐怖分子
Maybe spot the terrorists before they attack.

429
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:47,017
好吧  杰克
All right, Jack.

430
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,041
这也许并不是很标准的程序
It's not exactly standard procedure

431
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,058
拉着个死人满城转悠
ferrying a dead man's body across the city,

432
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:53,025
不过我愿意一试
but I'm willing to give it a shot.

433
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:54,073
我们这边会安排一条前往医院的路线
We'll figure out a hospital route

434
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:56,009
同时整理好一份对媒体的声明
and put a press statement together.

435
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,025
你那边也做好准备
You get ready on your end.

436
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,048
好的  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

437
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,085
准备好把尸体抬上车运走
Get that body ready for transport.

438
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,022
欧文  把你的人集结起来
Owen, assemble your men.

439
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,072
-五分钟之内做简报  -是  长官
- Briefing in less than five. - Yes, sir.

440
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:13,007
空中一号已到达指定路线上空  长官
Aerial one is in position over the route, sir.

441
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,043
狙击手小队已报到  全部就位
Sniper teams have checked in. They're all in place.

442
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,051
赶快  抓紧时间
Come on, hurry up.

443
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,010
走
Let's go.

444
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:14,019
一切都结束了  丹娜
It's over, Dana.

445
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:16,011
我们去处理另一具尸体
Let's get the other body

446
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:19,011
在返回反恐组之前把这些处理干净
and get cleaned up before we head back to CTU.

447
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,095
科尔  我们之间的事怎么办
Cole, what about us?

448
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:32,065
我不知道
I don't know.

449
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:45,017
我台刚从纽约反恐组总部获悉
We have just received word from New York Counterterrorist Headquarters

450
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:46,083
卡米斯坦伊斯兰共和国总统
that Farhad Hassan-- brother of

451
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,084
奥马·哈桑的弟弟  法哈德·哈桑
Islamic Republic of Kamistan President Omar Hassan--

452
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:52,021
目前还活着
has been found alive.

453
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:55,014
据称法哈德·哈桑较早前曾联络过反恐组
We're told that Farhad Hassan contacted CTU

454
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,031
表示同意向当局自首
a short while ago and agreed to turn him over to authorities.

455
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,031
法哈德还活着
Farhad is alive.

456
00:22:58,038 --> 00:22:59,027
什么
What?

457
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,005
反恐组马上做出回应
CTU responded immediately,

458
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,082
但当他们到达时却发现他遭到了枪击
but when they arrived, they found him shot.

459
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,072
声明中尚未提及他是如何受的枪伤
No word yet on how Farhad Hassan sustained these gunshot injuries,

460
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,042
但我们确知他将会幸存下来
but we do know that he is expected to survive,

461
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:10,085
他正在高度戒备的状态下
and he's being transported

462
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,073
被送往圣朱利安医院
to St. Julian's Hospital under heightened security

463
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,070
当局将在那里对他进行审问
where he will be questioned by authorities.

464
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,034
这不可能
This is impossible.

465
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,071
法哈德在今晚早些时候一直在逃...
Farhad Hassan has been on the run since early this evening...

466
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:21,045
我打中他两枪
I shot him twice.

467
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,049
但是你没有确认他死了
But you didn't make sure he was dead.

468
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,075
我说过了  当时没时间了
I told you I didn't have time!

469
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:30,090
我自己的烂摊子自己来收拾
I'll make this right. I'll go back.

470
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,089
你太招摇了
You're too conspicuous.

471
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,046
法哈德会受到严密保护
Farhad will be heavily protected.

472
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:36,089
但如果法哈德招供了
But if Farhad talks,

473
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:40,000
当局就会在我们改造好武器之前找到我们
the authorities could find us before we can build the weapon.

474
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,050
你以为我们就不知道那意味着什么吗
You think we don't know the implications?

475
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,078
我们派马科斯过去
We're sending Marcos.

476
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,078
他母亲是美国人
His mother's American.

477
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:51,031
他们不会怀疑他
They won't suspect him.

478
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,098
他在卡车里看守浓缩铀棒
He's in the truck with the rods.

479
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:17,084
喂
Hello?

480
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,052
妈妈  是我
Mom, it's me.

481
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:21,004
马科斯吗
Marcos?

482
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,070
嗯  听好  我不能讲太长时间
Yes. Listen, I can't talk for long.

483
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,017
怎么了  你还好吗
What is it? Are you okay?

484
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,067
我很好  妈妈
I'm fine, Mom.

485
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:29,048
我需要你为我做些事情
I need you to do something for me.

486
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:30,051
事关重大
It's very important.

487
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:32,071
好的
Okay.

488
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,001
什么事情
Okay. What is it?

489
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,079
我要你马上起床并且离开这座城市
I need you to get up right now and leave the city.

490
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,082
-到雪莱阿姨那里去  -雪莱阿姨那里
- Go to Aunt Shelley's. - Aunt Shelley's?!

491
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,036
就当为了我  好吗
Just do it for me, okay?

492
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,036
别问我为什么
Don't ask me why.

493
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,006
马上走
Leave right now.

494
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,099
马科斯
Marcos,

495
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,029
这太离谱了
this is crazy...

496
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:50,046
我不会大半夜无缘无故地离开自己家
I'm not gonna leave the apartment in the middle of the night for no reason.

497
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,033
并非无缘无故  只是现在还不能告诉你
There's a reason; I just can't tell you what it is right now.

498
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,044
求你了  妈妈  就当为了我
Please, Mom, do this for me.

499
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,090
你在哪
Where are you?

500
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,077
别为我担心
Don't worry about me.

501
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:01,098
我要是不确定你的安危我就哪也不去
Well, I'm not going anywhere unless I know you're all right.

502
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,012
我会去雪莱阿姨那里找你
I'll meet you at Aunt Shelley's,

503
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,065
到时候我会告诉你一切
and I'll explain everything.

504
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,018
快走  妈妈  马上
Go, Mom, now.

505
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,015
好吧  我这就走
Okay, I'm leaving.

506
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,056
我得挂了  我爱你
I have to go. I love you.

507
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,000

很好

510
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,057
是时候了
It's time.

00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:36,085
一路上你要让他看起来像还活着
You need to keep him looking alive the entire way.

512
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:39,048

513
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:41,029
-杰克  我是黑斯廷斯  -请讲

514
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,088
我已经跟新闻机构协调好了
We've coordinated with news outlets.

515
00:25:42,088 --> 00:25:45,019
他们把法哈德被逮捕

516
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,060
并被送往医院接受审问的假消息发出去了
and transport to the hospital for questioning.

517
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,026
只等大鱼上钩了
The hook has been baited.

518
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,095
好的  最符合逻辑的袭击时机是
Okay. The most logical place for them

519
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:52,029
我们前往医院的途中
to attack is when we're en route.

520
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:53,082
在半路上我们的防御是最脆弱的
That's where we're gonna be our most vulnerable.

521
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:56,012
纽约警察和反恐特警已经出发了
Well, NYPD and SWAT are mobilizing now.

522
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,029
他们会埋伏在沿途的战略要点上
They're going to be embedded at strategic points along the way.

523
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,056
他们同时严密警戒圣朱利安医院
They're also securing St. Julian's Hospital.

524
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,030
明白  告诉支援小组

525
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,023
务必要活捉这些恐怖分子
it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive.

526

我们通知过他们了  杰克
They've been briefed, Jack.

527
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,057
好的  我们出发了

你还好吗
Hey, are you all right?

是的  长官
Yes, sir.

532
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:18,038
我知道你和你的手下
Look, I know you and your men

533
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,001
还没有太多的实战经验
have not had a lot of field experience,

534
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:22,001
而我们却让你们处理这么极端的情况
and we have put you in an extreme situation.

535
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,095
不过我保证  要是我们被袭击
But I promise you, if we're attacked,

536
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,085
整条路线都会有人提供掩护
every part of this route is covered.

537
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:27,075
我们会在那里得到大量的支援
We've got a lot of support out there.

538
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:30,012
我很好  鲍尔先生
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer.

539
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,029
出发吧
Let's do this.

540
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,086
好
Yeah.

541
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:07,002
我们一行代表准备前往麦圭尔空军基地
Our delegation is preparing to head to McGuire Air force Base.

542
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,047
我将在那里设置一个临时指挥中心
We'll be setting up a temporary ops center there,

543
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:10,015
从而能够掌控局势的发展
where we'll be able to monitor the situation.

544
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,009
那其他的代表呢
And the other delegates?

545
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,007
联合国安保人员会协调疏散
U.N. Security will coordinate the evacuation.

546
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,053
整个过程会顺利进行
Everything should go smoothly.

547
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,060
想喝点儿什么吗  总统阁下
Can I get you anything, Madam President?

548
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,067
不用  谢谢  罗伯
No, thank you, Rob.

549
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,027
你已经够尽职尽责了
You have done more than enough.

550
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,054
我非常抱歉你刚上任几个月
I'm just sorry that your first few months

551
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,008
就面对如此巨大的挑战
on the job have been so challenging.

552
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,018
这是我得到锻炼的最好机会
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

553
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,042
待会儿见
I'll see you in a moment.

554
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:44,049
我的一个手下告诉我
I spoke to one of my aides.

555
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,099
他说我弟弟... 死了
He told me my brother is... dead.

556
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,069
确实如此
I'm afraid so.

557
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:52,023
反恐组结束这次行动之后
When CTU is finished with their operation,

558
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,001
我希望能把法哈德的遗体送回我国
I would like Farhad's remains to be returned to my country.

559
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,071
个人而言  我并不在乎他的尸首烂在何处
Personally, I don't care where his body rots,

560
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:01,038
但是我的母亲会希望他能得到厚葬
but my mother will want a proper burial.

561
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,039
这没有问题
I'll see that it's done.

562
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:04,078
但是  当前情况  总统阁下
But right now, Mr. President,

563
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:07,042
我们得疏散联合国总部大楼里的所有人
we need to evacuate the U.N.

564
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,019
我不会走的
I'm not leaving,

565
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:11,023
总统阁下  我要留下
Madame President. I'm staying here.

566
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,073
我不明白
I don't understand.

567
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,002
我女儿凯拉失踪了
My daughter Kayla is missing.

568
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:18,034
失踪了
Missing?

569
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:23,000
凯拉与我的前任安全主管有恋爱关系
Kayla is romantically involved with my former head of security.

570
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,091
她跟他私奔了
She's run off with him.

571
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:26,064
我能为您做些什么吗
Tell me what we can do to help.

572
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,091
我非常感激
I appreciate that,

573
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:30,071
不过我的侍卫队已经开始寻找她的下落
but my security teams are searching for her now.

574
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:34,002
我理解您有多么的担心
I understand how worried you must be,

575
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:37,012
但是即便你留下也帮不了她
but there is nothing that you can do to help her by staying here.

576
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,096
请你还是到一个安全的地方吧
Please come where you'll be safe.

577
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,096
我做不到  总统阁下
I can't, Madam President.

578
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,019
她一定还在城里某个地方
She's somewhere in the city,

579
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,089
她还不知道有核武器的威胁存在
with no idea that a nuclear threat exists.

580
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:50,057
在找到她之前我哪也不去
I won't go anywhere until she's been found.

581
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,050
好吧
All right.

582
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,061
我理解您的心情
I understand.

583
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,054
我会尽快和您再见面的
I will talk to you very soon.

584
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,008
谢谢
Thank you.

585

他们在第六大街向西转了
They're turning west at Sixth Street.

00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,049
已经开进医院了

587
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:41,018
克罗伊  把医院的监控画面调出来

588
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:44,052
打开面部识别系统进行捕捉

00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,003
反恐组  我是鲍尔  我们正在前往预定地点

591
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,013
法哈德的尸体已经被推到他的病房
Farhad's body's been taken to his room.

592
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,011
我们走
Let's go!

00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:03,004
守住大门

594
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:24,099

595

我是鲍尔
This is Bauer.

596

599
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:25,045
克罗伊告诉我你做的事了
Chloe told me what you did.

600
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,078
你和黑斯廷斯谈了条件
You leveraged Hastings.

601
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,042
你说这场危机化解之前
Said that you would head up field ops

602
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,008
你会一直指挥外勤行动
until this crisis was over

603
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:34,059
条件是反恐组撤销对我的所有指控
in exchange for CTU dropping any possible charges against me.

604
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:37,032
我没让你这么做  杰克
I didn't ask you to do that, Jack.

605
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,086
我知道你没有
I know you didn't.

606
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:40,060
白宫内部有人想陷害你
Look, someone in the White House is trying to set you up

607
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,013
把行动失败的责任全赖在你头上
to take responsibility for the failure of our mission,

608
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,033
我不能让他们得逞
and I couldn't let that happen

609
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,050
你什么错事都没做
because you did nothing wrong.

610
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,084
你能理解吗
You understand me?

611
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,031
蕾妮  你不要再纠结于这件事了
Renee, you need to let this go.

612
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,077
不管发生了什么  都不是你的责任
You're not responsible for what's happening.

613
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,064
好吧
Yeah, okay.

614
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,045
我先前说的话是认真的
Hey, I meant what I said earlier.

615
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:04,022
一切都平息之后  我会陪伴你左右
When this is over, I want to be there for you...

616
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,035
和你厮守在一起
with you.

617
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:09,047
-我很期待  -很好
- I'd like that. - Good.

618
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:11,009
我会派一个反恐组探员把你接到我的公寓
I'll have a CTU agent take you to my apartment.

619
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,056
事情结束之后  我去那里见你
I'll meet you there when this is over.

620
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:15,036
好的  杰克
All right, Jack.

621
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:19,013
有人在耳麦里呼我  我要挂了
Look, I'm getting chatter over the comm. I gotta go.

622
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,034
好  再见
Okay, bye.

623
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,070
我是鲍尔  请讲
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

624
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:25,004
杰克
Jack,

625
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,067
面部识别系统在伊斯兰共和国
facial recognition just picked up a match

626
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,073
情报人员文件中找到匹配结果了
with the I.R.K. Intelligence files.

627
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,066
他名叫马科斯·艾尔泽卡
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar.

628
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,073
在美国出生
American-born.

629
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,063
过去三年中为伊斯兰共和国从事间谍工作
Working undercover with the I.R.K. for the last three years.

630
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,073
他在哪
Where is he?

631
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,073
正在靠近侧门
Approaching the side entrance.

632
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,034
棕色头发  蓝色手术服  外面套着深蓝色夹克
Brown hair, blue scrubs, wearing a dark-blue jacket.

633
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,057
收到
Copy that.

634
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:42,064
等等  杰克  他手里有什么东西
Hold on, Jack. He's got something in his hand.

635
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,011
像是遥控引爆器
It looks like a remote detonator.

636
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:45,094
我想他身上绑有炸药
I think he's wearing a vest.

637
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,025
克罗伊  你能远程排爆吗
Chloe, can you disarm it from there?

638
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,025
也许吧  如果我能确认引爆器型号的话
Possibly, if I can pin down the detonator model,

639
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:53,035
我就可以用无线电发射器
I may be able to scramble the arming code

640
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,099
来扰乱引爆器发出的信号
using the transmitter in the mobile comm.

641
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,014
动手吧  
Get on it.

642
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,031
欧文  有人正向你方靠近
Owen, you've got a man approaching your position.

643
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:58,097
他是棕色头发

644
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:01,019
身穿蓝色手术服外面套着深蓝色夹克

645
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:04,045
-我看见他了  -他就是杀手
- Yeah. I see him. - He's our hitter.

646
00:33:04,045 --> 00:33:06,014
我们已确认他身着炸弹背心
We believe he's wearing an explosive vest

647
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:07,016
手持遥控引爆器
with a remote detonator.

648
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,033
好吧  我该怎么办
Okay. What should I do?

649
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,053
保持镇定  满足他的要求
Stay calm and do whatever he asks.

650
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,034
反恐组技术人员正尝试远程排爆
CTU techs are going to try and disarm the vest from offsite.

651
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,050
好的
Okay.

652
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,067
好的
Okay.

653
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,091
欧文
Owen?

654
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:17,017
欧文
Owen.

655
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,098
你可以做到的
You can do this.

656
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:21,061
只要尽可能拖住他就行了
Just try and slow him down as much as possible.

657
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,048
到处都有我们的人掩护你
We've got you covered every inch of the way.

658
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:25,012
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

659
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:32,026
抱歉  这里是警戒区
Excuse me. This is a secure area.

660
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:33,072
请出示你的证件
I'm going to need to see some I.D.

661
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:39,053
仔细给我听好了
Listen to me very carefully.

662
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,070
我身上有炸弹
I have a bomb.

663
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:45,007
把你的武器给我  否则我们同归于尽
Give me your weapon right now, or I'll kill us both.

664
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,004
武器给我  快
Your weapon now.

665
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,067
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

666
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,008
别激动
Just take it easy.

667
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:53,094
慢慢地
Slowly.

668
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,001
好
Yeah.

669
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:05,076
法哈德·哈桑在哪里

在三楼
Third floor.

671
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:08,089
带我去找他
Take me to him.

672
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,016
有人问起我
Anyone asks who I am,

673
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:11,083
就说我是个医生  已通过安检
you say I'm a doctor, and I'm cleared.

674
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,093
加油  孩子
Come on, son.

675
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,066
好吧
Okay.

676
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:15,090
走吧
Move.

677
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,007
走吧
Move.

678
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,030
快点
Go.

679
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:43,092
喂
Hello?

680
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:46,059
达莉亚  是我
Dalia, it's me.

681
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,037
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

682
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:49,010
别想让我改主意了  奥马
Don't try to change my mind, Omar.

683
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:51,044
我说过了  我去意已决
I told you, I'm leaving.

684
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:53,011
我打电话来不是为这事
I haven't called to change your mind.

685
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:56,098
凯拉或许有危险了
I called because Kayla may be in danger.

686
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,058
你什么意思
What do you mean?

687
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:01,001
她和塔林私奔了
She's run away with Tarin.

688
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,015
他们一直在一起交往
They've been seeing each other.

689
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:03,038
我知道
I know.

690
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:06,095
你知道多久了
How long have you known?

691
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,089
有关系吗  奥马
What difference does it make, Omar?

692
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:10,052
她有什么样的危险
What kind of danger is she in?

693
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:12,032
法哈德死了
Farhad is dead.

694
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,009
他曾想得到的核原料落到恐怖分子手里了
The nuclear material he tried to acquire is in the hands of the terrorists.

695
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:18,090
他们打算在曼哈顿就地使用
They're going to use it here in Manhattan.

696
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,003
不会吧
No.

697
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,000
到底怎么回事
How did this happen?

698
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,007
我以后再解释
I'll explain later.

699
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:26,017
但现在你得给凯拉打电话
But right now you need to call Kayla.

700
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,024
我留言了  但她不回我电话
I've left messages, but she won't return my calls.

701
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,091
但她也许会接你的电话
But she might talk to you.

702
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:34,011
拜托了  达莉亚  她很生我的气
Please, Dalia. She's angry at me.

703
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,091
我下令逮捕了塔林
I had Tarin arrested.

704
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,072
我当时以为他也是谋反者之一
I thought he was part of the conspiracy.

705
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:41,069
好吧
All right.

706
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:43,069
但奥马  你怎么办
But Omar, what about you?

707
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,042
别担心我了
Don't worry about me.

708
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:47,043
帮我找到女儿就行
Just help me find our daughter.

709
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:48,072
我尽力而为
I-I'll try.

710
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,099
塞碧拉  去找机长
Sabira, I need the captain.

711
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:38,008
克罗伊  我是杰克  我们正赶往三楼
Chloe, it's Jack. We're moving to the third floor.

712
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:39,031
排爆进行得怎么样了
Where are we at with the vest?

713
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,088
我已识别了引爆器型号  杰克
I've identified the detonator, Jack.

714
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:43,008
德国制造  型号K7
It's German-made, K7 variant,

715
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:45,055
但这个型号可用在多种结构的炸弹上
but that model is used in a lot of configurations.

716
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,097
我得看一眼那件炸弹背心
I'm going to need a visual on the vest.

717
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,039
收到
Copy that.

718
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:49,082
欧文  我是杰克
Owen, it's Jack.

719
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:52,033
反恐组得看到炸弹背心才能排爆
CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it.

720
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,096
我需要你把对方带到一个监视器下面
I need you to get the hostile underneath one of the surveillance cameras

721
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:56,023
让他给你看看炸弹
and make him show it to you.

722
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,063
重复一遍  反恐组得看到背心才能排爆
I repeat, CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it.

723
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,061
准备好了吗
You ready?

724
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,035
三队  他们正向你方靠近
Team three, they're approaching your position.

725
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,017
你想干什么
What are you doing?

726
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:35,021
我要看到证据
I want to see proof.

727
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,001
什么证据
Proof of what?

728
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,003
炸弹的
A bomb.

729
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,052
我不相信你有炸弹
I don't believe you have one.

730
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:43,054
你要是还不走  你就会知道我有没有了
You don't keep moving, you're gonna find out.

731
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:47,083
快点
Right now.

732
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,099
想找到法哈德  就给我看看
You want Farhad, you show me.

733
00:37:55,026 --> 00:37:57,036
我叫你快走
I said, "Move."

734
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:58,039
不行
No.

735
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,003
欧文做到了  杰克  我看到背心了
Owen did it, Jack. I've got a visual on the vest.

736
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:17,069
-现在  走吧  -好
- Now, move. - Okay.

737
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,042
我们就在法哈德房间附近就位
We're set in position near Farhad's room.

738
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,089
现在情况怎么样了
Now, what's the status?

739
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,065
炸弹是德式构造
It's a DDR configuration.

740
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:28,086
我只需要找到接收器的频率
I just need to pull up the frequency of the receiver.

741
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:30,026
克罗伊  在他们到达房间之前
Chloe, you've got about 30 seconds

742
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:31,083
你还有三十秒钟
before they reach that room.

743
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,097
3.15千兆赫  全球通GSM标准
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM.

744
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:41,027
正在无线电上运行
Running it through the mobile comm now.

745
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:42,097
得花上几秒钟
This'll take a few seconds.

746
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,061
准备出击
Stand by for assault.

747
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:55,015
趴下  脸朝下
On the floor, face down!

748
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:56,075
照我说的做
Do it now!

00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:57,092
不许动
Don't move!

750

快点  阿洛
Come on, Arlo.

751
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,033
快点
