还在镇压反对派
they're still cracking down on the opposition

6
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,046
毫无缓和迹象
and they're not showing any signs of letting up.

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,069
谣言四起
The rumors have already started

8
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:24,007
说是作为签约国的英方打算退出和谈

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,053
召集各国代表

我亲自去请求他们让和谈继续

贾莫特
Jamot.

15
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,069
你这是想拘捕我吗
Are you arresting me?

16
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:41,084
我要求和哈桑总统谈谈
I demand to speak with President Hassan.

17
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:44,022
这正是哈桑总统下的命令
President Hassan is the one who gave this order.

18
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:45,095
出什么事了  你声音不太对劲
What's wrong? You sound upset.

19
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,064
我想和你谈谈你的父亲

这里有证据保留室所在位置及其地形图

23
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,041
你用这张钥匙卡进去
This keycard will get you access.

24
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:57,073
我们怎么才能找到钱

25
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:58,097
证据存储箱都有编号
The evidence bins are numbered.

26
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,011
必须严格按我说的做  你就能自由进出了
Do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll be in and out.

27
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,033
没人会知道你去过那里
No one will know you were there.

28
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,025
政府已经知道核原料的事了
The authorities know about the nuclear material.

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,065
带欧力格去诊所只会引狼入室
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

30
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,050
不许看医生
No doctors.

31
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,089
医生说可以治好欧力格
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.

32
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:16,040
他都告诉我方法了
He showed me how.

33
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,073
你翅膀硬了  敢质疑老子的判断力了吗
Who are you to question my judgment?

34
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:22,089
绝不要违抗老子的命令
Never disobey an order from your father.

35
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,037
对不住了  儿子
I'm sorry, my son.

36
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,057
告诉我买家的情况
Tell me about this buyer.

德国军火商
German arms dealer.

我去会会这个叫迈尔的家伙
I'm going to have to meet this Meier,

42
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:39,059
为表诚意  他要先付定金
and I need a good-faith payment up front.

43
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:40,085
我不想重复说第二遍
I'm not going to tell you again.

44
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:43,030
出去  让我穿好衣服
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

45
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,078
妈的  过来
Damn it, come here

46
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:47,048
否则交易就取消
or the deal's off.

47
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,041
你就是迈尔
Meier?

48
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,070
没错
That's right.

49
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:55,034
五百万在哪里

50
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,034
已经汇入你的账户了
The money is in your account.

51
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:03,040
放下武器  快  放下
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it!

52
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,058
-迈尔  -你真以为能凭空卷走我五百万吗
- Meier. - You really think you can roll me for $5 million?

53
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,003
让我手下接电话
Let me talk to my man.

54
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,043
是我
Yes.

55
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,064
把他带回来
Bring him back here.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,026
他想见你
He wants to see you.

57
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:19,080
以下事件发生在晚上十点至十一点
The following takes place between 10:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M.

00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,071
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

59
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:30,080
进展很顺利
Well, that went well.

60
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,050
大家一致同意这份条约
Unanimous support for the treaty--

61
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,021
至少是几乎全体通过
well, nearly unanimous, anyway.

62
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,000
我心知肚明  自己快使尽浑身解数了
I have the distinct impression that I am running out of goodwill.

63
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:39,015
可能吧  可你为自己争取到了喘息的机会
Maybe, but you bought yourself some breathing room.

64
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,067
这些人已经错过了就寝时间
These people are already up past their bedtimes.

65
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,095
我想至少明早之前
I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing

66
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,072
我们不会再听到任何怨言
until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

67
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,057
恭喜您  总统阁下
Congratulations, Madam President.

68

69
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:53,078
现在我希望您能告诉我事情的真相
Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on.

70
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,017
我想我已经说清楚了
I thought I did.

71
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:56,079
您召集了国家卫队
You invoked national security,

72
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,057
恕我直言  您还没给出解释
which, with respect, is not an explanation.

73
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:00,000
这只是在告诉我们别多管闲事
It's saying "Don't ask."

74
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,051
总统阁下
Madam President,

75
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,050
你我两国间基于相互信任
our countries have a unique relationship

76
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:06,023
近一个世纪以来  一直关系甚密
based on a trust developed over nearly a century now.

77
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:09,052
您告诉我的一切我绝对守口如瓶
Anything you say to me is in the strictest confidence.

78
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:14,009
您可以告诉贵国首相  但别告诉别人
You may tell your prime minister and no one else

79
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,099
哈桑总统此番镇压行动
that President Hassan's crackdown

80
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,059
不只是为他的自身安全考虑
isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.

81
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,087
有人在暗中买卖极度危险的核原料
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.

82
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,064
显然他国家内部的反对派势力
Apparently a faction inside his country

83
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:26,053
被裁军计划搅得乱了阵脚
 was so disturbed by the prospect of disarmament,

84
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,081
他们决定亲自出马
they decided to take matters into their own hands.

85
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,094
核原料在哪里
Where are the materials?

86
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,053
就在我国境内
Here on our soil.

87
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:34,038
反恐小组采取了卧底行动
CTU is running an undercover operation

88
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,013
此时此刻  正设法夺回核原料
to retrieve them as we speak.

89
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,068
谁的电话
Who is that?

90
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:45,081
我猜是我的后援
My guess is, it is my backup.

91
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,011
见到瓦德米尔前不许打电话
No calls till we get to Vladimir.

92
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,077
你看现在的形势轮得到你发号施令吗
Does this look like a situation where you get to make demands?

93
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,057
我是迈尔
It's Meier.

94
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,089
我看不见你了
I lost my sight line on you.

95
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,072
我正离开大楼
I'm leaving the building.

96
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,004
进展顺利吗
Everything okay?

97
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,031
钱已经汇入瓦德米尔的账户
The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account.

98
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:00,013
我们正要去他办公室
We're going to his office.

99
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:01,022
应该几分钟后就能到
We should be there in a few minutes.

100
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,068
我和后援队一起跟过去
I'll follow with a backup team.

101
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,050
可能没必要
That might not be necessary.

102
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,037
他们刚刚还大开杀戒
After what they just pulled,

103
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,028
你确定不要支援吗
you're sure you're comfortable without backup?

104
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,007
我还有其它考虑
There are other considerations.

105
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,063
你是指蕾妮还在他们手里
You mean they have Renee.

106
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,080
没错
That's right.

107
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,020
好吧  我们先按兵不动
Okay, we'll stay back.

108
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,038
我会告诉你进展
I'll let you know.

109
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:17,064
什么事
What was that?

110
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,091
告诉他什么进展
Let him know what?

111
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,019
闭嘴  只管开车
Shut up and drive.

112
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,095
好了  我通过电子眼看到他们了
Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam.

113
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,005
一切顺利吗
Is everything okay?

114
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,008
看来杰克掌握了主动权
Jack seems to be in control.

115
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,087
看来不错  一切尽在掌握
Looks fine, all things considered.

116
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:34,053
司机看起来心神不宁
Driver looks a little worried.

117
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,005
话说回来  那家伙是谁
Who is this guy anyway?

118
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,014
我该对他做个脸部识别吗
Should I pass him on to facial recognition?

119
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,079
丹娜
Dana?

120
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,009
我得接个电话
I've got to take this.

121
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,048
是啊  没什么大不了
Yeah, sure, no biggie.

122
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:47,021
只不过是极度危险的核原料而已
Just unsecured nuclear materials.

123
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,048
喂
Yes.

124
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:53,087
我们到了  就在证物储存大楼外
We're there, outside the evidence building.

125
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,011
你在旁边小巷是吗
You're in the side alley, right?

126
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,023
不是
No,

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,010
我们把车停在前面  这样就能引人注意
we parked out front so everyone can see us.

128
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,094
得了吧  你以为我是蠢材吗
Come on, what do you think I am?

129
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,022
好  我一步步教你做
Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step.

130
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,044
我知道  我们准备好了
I know, we're ready.

131
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:07,001
我这里出了点状况  你等我几分钟
Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on for a few minutes.

132
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,025
原地等吗  我们会被发现的  珍妮
Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny.

133
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,032
如果你继续待在那  就没事了
You'll be fine if you just stay still.

134
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,066
距离下次巡逻还需要三十分钟
We have a 30-minute window before the next security pass.

135
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,019
我会尽快回来帮你
I will be with you the second I can.

136
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,047
阿洛  黑斯廷斯要我们去他办公室
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office

137
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,033
了解最新外勤动态
for a field update.

138
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:20,032
问个假设性的问题可以吗
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

139
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,060
如果是丹娜的问题  就不用假设了
If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical.

140
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:27,097
如果你未婚妻搞外遇
If your fiancee was cheating on you,

141
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,017
你会想知道吗
would you want to know?

142
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,025
如果是假设的话  那要看是谁问的
Hypothetically, who'd be asking--

143
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:33,029
是某位不想要饭碗了的偷窥狂在问吗
some creepy stalker who's about to get fired?

144
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,087
我是认真的
I'm serious.

145
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,025
我也是  上楼去吧
So am I. Just go upstairs.

146
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,036
这不关你的事
It's none of your business.

147
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,093
丹娜  科尔刚刚和杰克通了电话
Dana, Cole just called about Jack.

148
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,081
黑斯廷斯要我们去他办公室
Hastings wants us in his office.

149
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,030
把钥匙给我
Pass me back the keys.

150
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,005
慢慢地出来
Slowly get out,

151
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,053
把手放到车顶上
put your hands on the roof.

152
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,095
我们走
Let's go.

153
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,005
你就是这么谈生意的吗
So this is how you do business?

154
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,080
我如约预付了你五百万
I wire you the $5 million like we agreed,

155
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,044
然后你就想把我干掉
and then you try and take me out.

156
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,072
我没想到你是真的想做这笔生意
I did not think you were for real.

157
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,096
一场误会而已
It was a misunderstanding,

158
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,038
但都过去了
but it's past.

159
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:43,069
不打不相识
We are here.

160
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,005
瓦德米尔已开始跟他的老主顾们联络了
Vladimir has already started calling his contacts,

161
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,005
而且询问了对方关于核原料的事
inquiring about the nuclear materials.

162
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,038
我不在乎他做了什么
I don't care what he's done.

163
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,077
我要跟你谈谈
I want to talk to you.

164
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,087
那就说吧
So talk.

165
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,007
我要跟我的搭档单独谈谈  就现在
I want to talk to my partner alone now.

166
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,071
听着  他现在很生气
Look, he's upset,

167
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,098
人之常情
understandably.

168
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,012
机不可失
This is our chance.

169
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,068
我们应该现在就把他干掉
We should take him out now.

170
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,022
不行  我们需要他完成这次交易
No, we need him to do this deal.

171
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,041
为一个臭婊子值得冒这个险吗
Don't risk everything for a whore.

172
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,044
你要是再敢这么说她
You ever talk about her like that again,

173
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,082
我就把你做了
I'll kill you.

174
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:34,059
听明白了吗
You understand?

175
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:36,076
你到底在干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,054
我被授权让你退出行动
I have authorization to pull you out.

177
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,058
不  这是不可能的
No, that's not possible.

178
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,088
蕾妮  你已帮了大忙  下面的任务交给我
Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it.

179
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:45,034
杰克  你不能这么做  首先他不信任你
Jack, you can't. He doesn't trust you, first of all.

180
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,020
他愿意继续交易的唯一原因是因为我
The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me.

181
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:48,068
我很好  真的
I'm fine, really.

182
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,027
你要打电话吗  那我们走吧
You want to make calls, let's go.

183
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,083
在这点上你没有发言权
You don't have a say in this.

184
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:57,070
-我要让你退出行动  -不行  听着
- I am pulling you out. - No, look,

185
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,099
还没你想的那么糟
it's not a big deal.

186
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,078
我知道六年前他都对你做了些什么
I know what he did to you six years ago,

187
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,014
并且事情也已经不那么简单了
and it is a big deal.

188
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,071
杰克  如果我们就这样结束行动
Jack, if we stop this now,

189
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,025
那我所做的一切努力都白费了
then everything that I have done is for nothing.

190
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,063
没时间了
We're running out of time.

191
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,060
我们走
Let's go.

192
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:11,070
我们都快成功了  这么做是值得的
We're almost there, it'll be worth it.

是的
Yeah.

201
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,002
我以为你把我们忘了
I thought you forgot about us.

202
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,001
我倒希望如此
I wish I could.

203
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,008
拜托  别那个样子
Come on, don't be like that.

204
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,005
我们能开始了吗
Are we good to go?

205
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,005
对  马上开始
Yes, move now.

206
00:08:58,028 --> 00:08:59,001
我们走
Let's go.

207
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:03,001
门边上有个门禁装置  用我给你的那张卡
There's a security panel next to the door. Use the keycard I gave you.

208
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:06,096
密码是1668
The code is 1668.

209
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:09,005
1668
1668.

210
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,075
1668
1668.

211
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:25,047
继续走  警报声一会就会停掉
Keep moving, it will stop in a second.

212
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:27,008
如果你想得到那十二万
If you want the $120,000

213
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,047
你必须在二十分钟内脱身
you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes.

214
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,063
好的  哪扇门
Okay, which door is it?

215
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:38,029
左边最后一扇  密码是4660
It's the last one on the left. The code is 4660.

216
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:56,012
这有点像揭开圣诞节上做的倒计时链
It's like Christmas... with chain link.

217
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,054
好了  我们怎么才能找到钱
Okay, how do we find the money?

218
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,078
就在3101号隔间里
It's in section 3101.

珍妮  怎么进不去
Jen, what the hell is going on?

226
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,097
号码是多少
What number is it?

227
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,047
是3101吗
Is it 3101?

228
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,089
3101  这间是3110  拜托
3101-- this is 3110. Come on.

229
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,098

230
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,091
搞错了不行吗  别说了

过道走到底左手边就是3101
3101 is down the aisle on the left.

2824, 2824, 2824.

235

证物箱编码是4301
Bin number's 4301.

236
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,064
4301
4301.

237
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,011
伙计  全是数字
Oh, man, it's too many numbers.

238
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,003
4301  4301
4301, 4301.

239
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,033

太棒了
That's beautiful.

242

别说了  赶快出去
Just shut up and get out of there.

243
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,038
不到十五分钟就会有人来巡岗了
The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes.

244

赶紧把门关上然后闪人
Close the doors and leave.

246
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,005
十五分钟  我们这就走
15 minutes. We're leaving.

247
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,021
脱身后打我电话
Call me when you're clear.

248
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,090
一定  珍妮
I sure will, Jenny.

00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,057
我们走吧
Let's go!

250
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:39,004
再等等

看看还有别的什么
Check out some of this stuff.

252

Yeah, 15 minutes.

254
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,074
你确定吗
Are you sure, then?

255
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:19,031
没听说有人在卖这种核原料吗
You haven't heard of anyone dealing in these materials?

256
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:24,053
好吧  感谢你百忙中听我的电话
All right. Well, thank you for your time.

257
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:25,088
很抱歉  打扰你了
I'm sorry to trouble you.

258
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,038
一无所获
Nothing.

259
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,034
他们不喜欢这么晚了还被电话骚扰
They did not appreciate being called so late.

260
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:32,075
蕾妮  给我切点面包
Renee, cut me some bread.

261
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,073
给
Here.

262
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,076
喝点水可能会让你轻松点
You might want to ease up on the drinking.

263
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,052
你已经打了好几个电话了
You've got some calls to make.

264
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,003
我想喝就喝
I drink what I want.

265
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,083
蕾妮  面包呢
Renee, where's the bread?

266
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,026
来了
Coming.

267
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,053
喝吧
Drink.

268
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,033
怎么切得
What is this?

269
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,002
太薄了
It is too thin.

270
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,076
应该再切得厚点
It should be thick.

271
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,061
又厚又漂亮
Nice and thick.

272
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,067
这就对了
There we are.

273
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,059
你知道吗  她变了
She's changed, you know?

274
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:32,052
六年前
Six years ago,

275
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:34,081
她觉得我配不上她
she thought she was too good for me.

276
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,051
现在她听话多了
Now, she is much more friendly.

277
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,088
也许我该谢谢你  
Maybe I should thank you--

278
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:44,092
全拜你们在墨西哥城一起度过的时光所赐
all that time you were together in Mexico City.

279
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,032
拜托
Come on.

280
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,003
我看见你瞧她的眼神了
I see how you look at her.

281
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:51,068
别告诉我  你对她没意思
Don't tell me you didn't.

282
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,029
想唠叨的话  快去打电话
You want to keep talking, do it on the phone.

283
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,037
要不然核原料会被别人买走  
Otherwise, the nuclear materials will be gone,

284
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,020
我们的交易就吹了
and this deal will be dead.

285
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:07,037
好吧  可我不喜欢你在这里咄咄逼人的架势
Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck.

286
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,037
卢戈  把他带出去
Lugo, get him out of here.

287
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,074
我的伏特加喝完了
And I'm running out of my vodka.

288
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,090
去给我买点
Go get me some more.

289
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,086
坐下
Sit down.

290
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,085
去把守前门

291
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,021
我去去就回
I won't be long.

292
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,078
我的小儿子
My younger son.

293
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:58,087
我想葬了他  格雷戈神父
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.

294
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:02,068
当然  可要等等
Of course, but that will take a little time.

295
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,097
墓地的工人得把坟墓准备好
The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave...

296
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,033
不行  现在就葬
No. You will do it now

297
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,020
就葬在后面
out back.

298
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,028
我的人会帮他挖坟墓
My men will dig his grave.

299
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,072
瑟吉·彼得罗维奇
Sergei Petrovich,

300
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,044
那你就按正确的做法来
Then make it right.

301
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,073
把他当做一位战死沙场  马革裹尸的战士
Treat him like a soldier who died on the battlefield and must be buried there.

302
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,040
他是死在...
Is that how he died?

303
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,084
沙场上吗
In battle?

304
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,057
你按标准来就行了
You just make it right.

305
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,007
说完所有祷告词
Say all the prayers.

306
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:35,043
我的身后事  我不在乎
Where I end up, I don't care.

307
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,067
可这孩子  是与天使同在的
But this boy is with the angels.

308
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,015
我的人很快就来
My men will be with you soon.

309
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:03,035
回避一下
Leave us.

310
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:15,050
起来
Get up.

311
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,055
看看我  约瑟夫
Look at me, Josef.

312
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,072
我想让你明白
I want you to understand

313
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,001
我所做的一切  都是为了你
that everything I've done, I've done for you

314
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:30,090
都是为了家族
and for our family.

315
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,039
您杀了我弟弟
You killed my brother.

316
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,026
因为我爱他
Because I loved him,

317
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,019
因为我不忍心看他活受罪
because I couldn't bear to see him suffer,

318
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,031
也因为别无选择
because there was no other way.

319
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,052
总有其他办法的
There's always another way.

320
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,030
面对核原料的买卖时  我们别无选择
Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials.

321
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,050
我们不能冒被政府发现的危险
We cannot risk the authorities finding out.

322
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,044
你知道的
You know that.

323
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,091
你不明白我为什么干这行吗
You don't know why I'm doing this?

324
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,075
因为我死后
Because when I die,

325
00:16:56,088 --> 00:17:00,040
我想给你  给家族留下一笔巨大的遗产
I want to leave you and your family a worthy inheritance.

326
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,010
财富  名望
Wealth, respect,

327
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,055
影响力
consequence.

328
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,023
你能明白吗
Can you understand that?

329
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,007
终有一天你会明白的
One day you will.

330
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:16,022
你儿子长大后  你就会明白
As your son grows older, you will.

331
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,081
你也会明白
And you will understand

332
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,098
我是多么爱你

333
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,056
我唯一的儿子
My only son.

334

格雷戈神父过来安葬欧力格
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.

335
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,013
你去帮他吗
Will you help him?

336
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,042
他是我弟弟
He's my brother.

337
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,078
谢谢你
Thank you.

338
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,073
准备好了告诉我
Call when you are ready.

339
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:50,071
怎么了
What is it?

340
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,012
是瓦德米尔·勒塔纳的电话
Vladimir Laitanan.

341
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,060
他说事关重大
He says it's important.

342
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,026
瓦德米尔  有何贵干
Vladimir, what do you want?

343
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,072
瑟吉·彼得罗维奇

344
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,038
抱歉突然来电打扰  先生
I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir.

345
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,052
你家人还好吗
Uh, your family is well?

346
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,097
我问你有何贵干
I said, what do you want?

347
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:15,079
我有笔生意跟你谈
I have a business proposition.

348
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:18,034
那工作时间再打给我  别半夜三更地打来
Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night.

349
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,082
不  不是  这件事等不得
No, no, no, this can't wait.

350
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:23,036
我听说有核原料要卖
I hear there are materials for sale,

351
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:26,018
很贵很危险的那种
expensive materials, dangerous ones.

352
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,006
少跟我拐弯抹角  什么原料
Talk straight. What materials?

353
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,072
核原料棒
Nuclear rods.

354
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:34,062
高浓缩铀
Highly enriched uranium.

355
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,024
那你为什么打给我
So, why are you calling me?

356
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,076
如果有谁有本事做成这种买卖  那一定是你
If anyone has the organization to pull off such a deal, it's you.

357
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,078
过奖了
I'm flattered.

358
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,077
我有个买家  一个德国人
I have a buyer here, a German.

359
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,060
他愿意出一大笔钱
He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them.

360
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,023
任何人出价的两倍
Double any offer you have.

361
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,086
那他就跟你一样蠢
Then he is as stupid as you are.

362
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,082
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

363
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,087
没人敢贩卖核原料棒  没人敢
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.

364
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,035
抱歉
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,071
误会了
A misunderstanding.

366
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,096
别再打给我
Don't call me again.

367
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,070
他不知道我说的什么
He had no idea what I was talking about.

368
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,058
好吧  那我们打给下一个
All right, then we call the next person.

369
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,042
你没听明白
You're not listening.

370
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,053
他说没人敢贩卖这些东西
He says nobody sells these things.

371
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:20,011
你就要做成人生中最大的买卖了  瓦德米尔
You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir.

372
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,002
他只是嫉妒  他不能参与其中
He's just jealous that he's not in on it.

373
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,015
过来  过来
Come here. Come here.

374
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,004
喂  等等
Look, later.

375
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:32,073
等等
Later.

376
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,090
你再打点电话
Once you've made more calls.

377
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:37,040
拜托
Come on.

378
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,085
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

379
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:49,002
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

380
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,051
瓦德米尔知道浓缩铀棒的事了
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.

381
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,080
你打算怎么做
What are you going to do?

382
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:05,028
我是巴扎耶夫  你得停下来

383
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,074
你知道该去哪

384
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:09,009
这样我们就迟了

385
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,055
照做  等我电话

386
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,067
安东
Anton?

387
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,034
安东  靠路边停车

388
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:24,092
我们不做了

389
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,040
喂
Yes?

390
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,056
总统阁下  我是艾莉森·泰勒

391
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,080
我们定好继续协商的

我知道我迟到了  抱歉

393
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,008
今晚的事...

00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,034
今晚的事非同小可
The events of this evening make it more important than ever

395
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:12,000
我们要完成协议
that we complete our work on this treaty.

396
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,013
总统阁下  我要明确您的意图
Mr. President, I need to know your intentions.

397
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,024
我的意图
My intentions?

398
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,043
您对国内的镇压
The crackdown on your countrymen.

399
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,059
我听说  您连一位自己的幕僚都逮捕了
I've been informed that you've even arrested one of your own delegation.

400
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,003
那是我们的内政
That's an internal matter.

401
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:26,006
不  阁下  没那么简单
No, sir, it is not.

402
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,058
不到一个小时前
Less than an hour ago,

403
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,066
我跟二十几个国家代表保证
I assured delegates from two dozen countries

404
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:32,025
您还是我们实现和平的最佳人选

我个人跟他们担保  您会遵守

406
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,089
我们签署的协议及其精神

我会的
And I will.

408
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:39,089
您能向我保证吗
Do I have your word on that?

409
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:43,019
总统阁下  未来几小时内
Madame President, within the next few hours,

对此我将采取必要措施

412
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,066
那被您逮捕的那位代表呢

413
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,062
会被释放或被指控

00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:57,079
他的口气如何
How do you think he sounded?

417
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,088
不像他自己
Not like himself.

418
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:07,020
他招了吗
Did he talk?

419
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,008
没有  阁下
No, sir.

420
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,094
贾莫特拒不承认对针对您的阴谋知情
Jamot denies all knowledge of the plot against you.

421
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:12,074
审讯得严吗
How forceful was the interrogation?

422
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:13,064
很严
Very.

423
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,077
我亲自审的
I did it myself.

424
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:18,025
我不相信他同您弟弟有任何瓜葛
I don't believe he's involved with your brother in any way.

425
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:20,071
你知道贾莫特跟极端分子有亲属关系
You know Jamot has connections with the extremists.

426
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,046
一个反对党的表亲  阁下
A cousin in the opposition party, sir.

427
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,087
仅此而已
That's all.

428
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,013
他要是不招  我们就得来点硬的了
If he won't talk, we have to force the issue.

429
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,090
他家中有妻小  对吧
He has a wife and children back home, is that correct?

430
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,087
一个九岁的儿子和一个七岁的女儿
A boy, nine. A girl, seven.

431
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:42,091
让安全局逮捕他们
Have the Security Services arrest them.

432
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,069
使用任何必要的压力迫使贾莫特招供
Apply whatever pressure's necessary to make Jamot talk.

433
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,040
你有话要说吗

434
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:02,046
是的  阁下  
Yes, sir.

435
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,004
我有

436
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,021
您将我们团结起来
You rallied us around you on the promise

437
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,047
承诺不再使用暴力手段
that you would put an end to such tactics.

438
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,080
总统阁下  我会尽一切努力
Mr. President, I will do everything humanly possible

439
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,006
找到您弟弟的下落  但是我请求您
to find your brother but, please,

440
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,072
别逼我违背你我共同坚持的原则
do not ask me to violate the principles that you and I both stand for.

441
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:27,040
谢谢  塔林
Thank you, Tarin.

442
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:29,001
我妻子走了
With my wife gone,

443
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:32,060
再也没人跟我说真心话了
I have no one to speak the truth to me anymore.

444
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:37,018
再检查一遍所有人的电脑和电话记录
Check everyone's computer and phone records again.

445
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,043
务必不要遗漏任何蛛丝马迹
See to it that nothing was overlooked.

446
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,040
当然  阁下
Of course, sir.

447
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,090
我们走
Let's go.

448
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,097
纳比尔留在这里收拾这些文件
Nabeel can stay and pack up these files.

449
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,073
别管这些文件了
Forget the files.

450
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,077
什么
Sir?

451
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,002
给安全局打电话
Call the Security Services

452
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:10,033
让他们照我的命令把贾莫特的妻小抓起来
and have them round up Jamot's wife and children as I asked.

453
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:13,083
我不明白  您刚告诉塔林...
I don't understand. You just told Tarin that...

454
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,013
我直接命令你
I gave you a direct order.

455
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:17,083
你执行还是不执行
You obey it or not?

456
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,046
遵命  阁下
Yes, sir.

00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:21,023
我这就给安全局打电话

好
Good.

459
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:28,055
把塔林的材料从这里找出来
And find Tarin's records in that mess.

460
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:31,068
他不想让贾莫特招供  可能另有企图  
He might have his own reasons for not wanting Jamot to talk.

461
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,040
尼克
Nick.

462
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:44,077
尼克  赶快  我们得赶紧走了
Nick, come on, we've got to move, man.

463
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,019
巡警随时可能出现
There's going to be a patrol here any minute.

464
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,027
赶快
Come on.

465
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,069
-把钱给我  -什么
- Give me the money. - What?

466
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,056
钱  蠢货
The money, dumbass!

467
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:56,087
这些钱我们五五分账
We're going to split this.

468
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,013
我不会再重复一遍
I ain't gonna ask you again.

469
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:01,093
你跟我玩真的吗
You can't be serious.

470
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,019
混蛋  别闹了
Bitch! Knock it off!

471
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,075
赶快  伙计  快走
Come on, man, let's go!

472
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,001
混球
Jackass!

473
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,067
我说过我们早该离开
I told you we should've gone!

474
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,067
真是个白痴
Such an idiot.

475
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:24,010
我刚接到汉密尔顿堡危险品实验室的来电
I just received a call from the Hazmat Lab at Fort Hamilton.

476
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,095
他们分析了从刺客身上发现的铀残留物
They've analyzed the traces of uranium found on Hassan's assassin.

477
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:28,038
他们认定了铀的来源了吗  
Did they identify where it came from?

478
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:29,091
样本太小了  没法精确判明  
Sample's too small to be precise,

479
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,095
但是那些铀来自前苏联地区
but the uranium is of Soviet origin.

480
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,077
他们正重新校正检测结果
They're recalibrating their tests now.

481
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:36,040
很好  随时向我汇报  克洛伊
Great. Keep me informed, Chloe.

482
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:42,091
卡文  你们出来了吗
Kevin, are you out of there?

483
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,087
不  还没有
No, not exactly.

484
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:47,016
你们怎么回事
What are you talking about?

485
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,072
你说你们二十分钟前就离开了
You told me you left there 20 minutes ago.

486
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:51,021
好吧  可是我们没出来  现在有人进来了
Okay, yeah, we didn't. Okay, now somebody's here.

487
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,025
你个白痴
You idiot!

488
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:53,084
我承认我白痴行吧  赶快帮忙
Yeah, fine, all right, just hurry.

489
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,043
有人进入走廊了
Somebody's in the hallway.

490
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,011
难以置信  你竟捅出这种娄子
I can't believe you let this happen.

491
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,059
你要是被抓  我就死定了
If you get caught, I am dead.

492
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,094
我们是一根线上的蚂蚱
Hey, we all are.

493
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:03,026
好吧  赶快想想办法把我们弄出去
All right, so just find us a way out of here.

494
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,000
坚持一下
Hang on.

495
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,053
别慌
Stay calm.

496
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,050
是个警察
It's a cop.

497
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,001
他就在你们进去的房间外边的走廊里
He's in the hallway right outside the room you're in.

498
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,050
还有另外一个出口
There's another exit.

499
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,013
就在你身后的拐角
In the corner right behind you.

500
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:28,046
快  快  快
Come on, come on! Come on.

501
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:34,026
天哪  你... 你们都干了些什么
My God, wh-what have you done?

502
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,091
见鬼  锁着呢
Damn it! It's locked!

503
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,023
他马上就要进来了
He's coming inside right now.

504
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,006
你们得从他背后溜过去
You're going to have to slip past him,

505
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,090
从你们进来的门出去
go out the door you came in.

506
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,087
总台  我是10岗11号  我在仓库...
Control, this is ten post 11. I'm at the warehouse...

507
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:23,068
尼克
Nick!

508
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:26,026
你在干什么  不要
What are you doing?! No!

509
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,079
卡文  拦住他
Kevin, stop him!

510
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,093
快走  快走  快走
Come on, come on, come on.

511
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,089
他已经报警了
Hey! He called it in.

512
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,012
我们得赶紧走
We gotta go!

513
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:36,034
快
Come on!

514
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,025
-卡文  拦住他  -快走
-Kevin, stop him! - Come on.

515
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,010
我们脱身后马上给你打电话
We'll call you when we're clear!

516
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,082
塔林  你还好吧
Tarin, are you all right?

517
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:07,048
你什么时候从大使馆回来的
When did you get back from the embassy?

518
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,038
刚回来
Just now.

519
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,067
我能进来吗
May I come in?

520
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,036
怎么了
What is it?

521
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:17,001
这里就我一个人
It's only me here.

522
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,051
这里安全
It's safe.

523
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,015
出什么事了
What's wrong?

524
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:35,047
你知道你父亲抓了很多人
You know your father has had many people arrested,

525
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,014
包括贾莫特
including Jamot.

526
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:41,091
现在又把贾莫特的妻子和两个孩子关在家里
Now he's having Jamot's wife and two children detained back home,

527
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,026
以此来逼他招供
so they can be used to force him to talk.

528
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,034
不会的
No.

529
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,057
这里面一定有误会
There must be some mistake.

530
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:50,016
他亲自下的命令
He gave the order himself.

531
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,099
我本以为我已经说服他了
I thought I'd convinced him not to,

532
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,060
但是他骗了我
but he was lying to me,

533
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,030
背着我下了命令
he went behind my back.

534
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:02,034
凯拉  你父亲是位伟人
Kayla, your father is a great man.

535
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,049
我崇敬他胜过任何人
I respect him more than anyone I have ever known.

536
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,085
但法哈德的背叛改变了他
But Farhad's betrayal has changed him.

537
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,011
我们能做什么
What can we do?

538
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,025
请开门
Open up, please.

539
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:19,063
他们来这里干什么
What are they doing here?

540
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:21,010
我不知道
I don't know.

541
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:22,040
开门
Open up.

542
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,040
塔林  待在这里
Tarin, stay here.

543
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,007
-什么事  纳比尔  -凯拉小姐
- Yes, Nabeel? - Miss Kayla,

544
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,053
我们到处在找塔林
we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.

545
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:34,077
您看见他了吗
Have you seen him?

546
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,023
没有
No.

547
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,070
出什么事了吗
Is there some problem?

548
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,007
你以为你在做什么
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,030
我们奉命行事  凯拉小姐
We have orders, Miss Kayla.

550
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,097
我说了他不在这里
I said he wasn't here.

551
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
很抱歉  但是我不相信
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

552
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,003
你不能就这么硬闯进来
You can't just barge in here!

553
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,020
我要跟我父亲谈谈
I need to talk to my father!

554
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,068
纳比尔
Nabeel.

555
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:57,078
你何必带着荷枪实弹的警卫来找我
Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me?

556
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,097
总统说你可能跟他的弟弟是一伙的
The president says you may be involved with his brother.

557
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,020
凭什么这么说
Based on what?

558
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:02,040
无凭无据
Nothing.

559
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:05,030
就因为我不允许折磨一个无辜的家庭吗
Only that I would not allow an innocent family to be tortured.

560
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,077
他命令我拘禁你
He's ordered me to detain you.

561
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,093
我别无选择
I have no choice.

562
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,047
你当然有选择的余地  纳比尔
You do have a choice, Nabeel.

563
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,017
告诉我父亲他犯了一个错误
Tell my father he's made a mistake,

564
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,097
没有人比塔林更忠心耿耿了
that there's no one more loyal than Tarin.

565
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,020
纳比尔  这太荒唐了  你知道的
Nabeel, this is insane, and you know it.

566
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,047
别自讨苦吃  好吗
Don't make this worse, please.

567
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,080
你们没看出来吗  我也束手无策
Don't you see? My hands are tied.

568
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:35,080
让我去跟我父亲谈谈
Let me talk to my father.

569
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,003
他下令不允许有人打搅
He's given orders not to be disturbed.

570
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:40,003
您也不行
Even by you.

571
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,093
我会跟他谈谈的
I'll talk to him!

572
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:46,097
我会让他回心转意的
I'll get him to change his mind!

573
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,087
不  我明白  罗曼
No, I understand, Roman.

574
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,087
我们以后有机会再合作  好吗
We'll do business some other time, okay.

575
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:14,047
就这样了
That's it.

576
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,067
最后一个
Last one.

577
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,037
他也不知道核原料棒的事
He also knows nothing about nuclear rods.

578
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,073
他也说做这个买卖等于自杀
He also said it's suicide to deal in them.

579
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,037
迈尔在浪费我们的时间
Meier has wasted our time.

580
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,037
不  迈尔的情报很准确  我们得再想想
No, look, Meier's intel is good. So we need to think.

581
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,090
-还能打给谁  -没人了
- Who else can we call? - No one.

582
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:26,090
我已给所有可能做这种生意的人打过电话了
I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things.

583
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,027
那就是你打过电话的这些人里有了解情况的
Then somebody that you've already talked to has to know something.

584
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,060
蕾妮  到此为止吧
Renee, it's-it's done.

585
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,023
可能他们不想承认知情
Look, maybe they don't want to admit it.

586
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:33,093
或者他们不知道你对这件事有多重视
Maybe they don't know how serious you are.

587
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:35,060
-你应该再给他们打回去  -我说了不行
- You should call them back. - I said no.

588
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:37,023
告诉他们你有买主  告诉他们你有钱付款
Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money.

589
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,053
闭嘴
Shut up!

590
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:40,043
我喜欢你的脸蛋不代表
Just because I like your face doesn't mean

591
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,077
我能忍受你胡说八道
I have to put up with your crap.

592
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,020
我们一个晚上就赚到了五百万
We made $5 million. A good night's work.

593
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:46,007
为什么我们放着十倍的钱不赚
Why settle for five when we can have 50?

594
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,083
你什么时候变得这么贪得无厌了
When did you get so greedy?

595
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:53,023
五百万足够了
$5 million is plenty.

596
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:55,043
加上成全了我们一对野鸳鸯  也不算糟吧
Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it?

597
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,010
不算糟
Oh, it's not bad.

598
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,010
但是可以更好
But it could be better.

599
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,033
再给他们打一遍
Call them again.

600
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:03,053
就当为了我
Do it for me.

601
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:07,058
快  瓦德米尔  再催催他们
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.

602
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,000
-没有不透风的墙  -你到底哪根筋不对
- Somebody knows something. - What is your problem?

603
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,065
没人知道了  该打的电话都打完了
Nobody knows. There's no one left to call.

604
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,071
你现在就出去  告诉迈尔他可以走了
Now you go out there and you tell Meier to leave, okay.

605
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,021
我不会去告诉他
I'm not telling him anything!

606
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:18,015
除非你继续打电话  否则我不去
Not until you try again.

607
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,099
听着  一切都结束了  你有病啊
Look, it's over! What is wrong with you?!

608
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,011
我需要这桩买卖
I need this deal.

609
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,025
这就是你来的目的吗  就为买卖
That is why you're here? The deal?

610
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,028
不然还有什么理由  你觉得我是为你而来的吗
Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you?

611
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,091
站起来
Get up.

612
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,085
住手  住手
Stop! Stop!

613
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,021
住手
Stop!

614
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:52,021
天哪
Oh, God.

615
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,061
天哪
Oh, God.

616
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,015
天哪
Oh, God.

617
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,021
天哪
Oh, God!

618
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:22,005
没事了  没事了
It's all right. It's all right.

619
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,038
都结束了
It's over.

620
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:34,038
结束了  没事了
It's over. It's okay.

621
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:49,040
勒塔纳联系了
Laitanan contacted everyone

622
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,075
所有他认为可能会有核原料消息的卖家
he thought might have information on the nuclear materials.

623
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:52,092
没有人回应
No one responded.

624
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:54,052
然后他说该做的都做了
That's when he said he was finished.

625
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:56,052
蕾妮一直在给他施压
Renee kept pushing him,

626
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:58,052
然后事态就失控了
and it got ugly.

627
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:00,042
勒塔纳死了
Laitanan's dead.

628
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:02,002
他先袭击了她
He attacked her.

629
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,052
然后呢  你就干掉了他吗
And so, what, you took him out?

630
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,048
不  是她干的
No, she did.

631
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,048
她干的
She did?

632
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:07,065
半小时以前  
Half an hour earlier,

633
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:09,002
她还在和这家伙风流快活
she was having sex with the guy.

634
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,048
这到底是怎么回事  杰克
How does that even happen, Jack?

635
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,065
怎么  她失控了吗
What, she lose it?

636
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,018
她只是自卫而已
She was defending herself.

637
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:15,042
在跟进这案子前  你我都知道他有暴力倾向
Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in.

638
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,058
他有暴力倾向吗
He's violent?

639
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:18,018
-他都死翘翘了  -是的
- He's dead on the floor. - Yes, he is.

640
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,005
现在我们仍没解除核原料的威胁
And right, now, we still don't have the nuclear materials secured,

641
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,028
所以我建议另找线索
so I suggest we move on.

642
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,068
另找线索
Move on?

643
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:25,048
他是我们唯一的线索  杰克
He was our only lead, Jack.

644
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:26,095
现在你叫我上哪找新线索
Now, where do we move on to?

645
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:29,018
可以从勒塔纳打出的电话着手调查
We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made.

646
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:30,048
这里也有一些文件
There's also physical files here

647
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:32,005
以及一台电脑可供调查
and a computer to go through.

648
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,068
好吧  科尔  你听到了吗
Yeah, fine. Cole, are you getting this?

649
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,092
是的  长官  我们正在路上
Yes, sir. We're en route

650
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,062
刚从集结待命区出发  五分钟后到
from the staging area, five minutes out.

651
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:39,055
还需要鉴证科来现场取样调查
We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart.

652
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:40,073
好  班尼特跟我一起来了
Yeah, I got Bennett with me.

653
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,012
在大部队赶来之前  他可以先来协助
He can coordinate till the full team arrives.

654
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:43,028
尽你们所能吧
Just do what you can.

655
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:45,052
把勒塔纳的尸体带回来进行尸检
And bring Laitanan's body back here for autopsy.

656
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:47,022
我想知道到底发生了什么
I want to know what the hell happened.

657
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,098
有什么别的好消息吗
Any other good news?

658
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,065
杰克
Jack?

659
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,082
科尔
Cole?

660
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:54,001
丹娜
Dana?

661
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:55,045
什么事
Excuse me?

662
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,002
我说还有别的什么新进展吗
I said, anything else?

663
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,048
没有  长官
No, sir.

664
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,058
好吧
Okay, then.

665
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,038
-你们来了再说吧  -是  长官
- We'll see you when you get here. - Yes, sir.

666
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:07,042
我们整个行动都给搞砸了
Our entire operation just went south.

667
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:10,085
你能稍稍精力集中一点吗
You think you could show a little interest?

668
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:12,038
给我打起精神来
Pull it together!

669
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:24,098
你没必要这样做
You didn't have to do that.

670
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,048
做什么
Do what?

671
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:29,068
就是在黑斯廷斯面前给我打掩护
Cover for me with Hastings.

672
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,088
我说的都是实话
All I did was tell him the truth.

673
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,088
他们看到瓦德米尔尸体时  就会真相大白
When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened.

674
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,078
你认为真相是什么
What do you think happened?

675
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,092
正如你所说
It's like you said.

676
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:53,005
我还没准备好
I couldn't handle it.

677
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:57,035
我很抱歉
God, I'm sorry.

678
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,042
没关系的
It's all right.

679
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:00,028
不  有关系
No, it's not.

680
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,062
我刚才差点杀了你
I could have killed you.

681
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,042
我是成事不足败事有余
I've made such a mess of everything.

682
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,008
我本以为如果我能完成这次任务的话
I just thought that if... if I did this,

683
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:13,012
我就能恢复正常
I could make it all right.

684
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:14,075
就能找回我原来的生活
I could have my life back.

685
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:20,015
你随时都能找回你原来的生活
You can have your life back any time you want.

686
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,022
只要你有这样的愿望
You just need to want it.

687
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:24,022
怎么找回
How?

688
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:26,092
我试过了  根本不知道如何找回
I've tried, and I don't know how.

689
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:28,085
我...
I don't...

690
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:32,058
我一无所有  无依无靠
I don't have anything, anyone.

691
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:35,038
你还有我
You've got me.

692
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,055
知道吗
Okay.

693
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:44,045
看着我  看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

694
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:50,045
知道吗
Okay?

695
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:55,092
我不想像这样结束
I didn't want it to end like this.

696
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:57,051
我明白
I know.

697
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:01,085
我们的行动已经比三小时前推进了很多
Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago.

698
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:05,015
勒塔纳打过的每个电话都是我们能跟进的重要线索
Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead that we can follow up,

699
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,047
这都归功于你
and that's because of you.

700
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:08,015
你完成了你的使命
You did your part.

701
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,032
现在就让反恐小组接手吧
Now let CTU do their job.

702
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:13,018
好吗
Please?

703
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,092
让我送你回家
Let me take you home.

704
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:21,022
好
Okay.

705
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:23,022
那就好
Okay.

706
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,018
该死  他们刚才就一定已经出发了
Damn it, they really must have been moving.

707
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,045
反恐小组准该赶到这里了
CTU's here already.

708
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:30,018
听我说  这很重要
Listen to me. This is really important.

709
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:32,064
瓦德米尔先攻击你  你是自卫
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.

710
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:34,045
-事情就是这样  -要这样说吗
- That's what happened. - I don't know.

711
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:37,028
我作证  如果有其他任何人要质疑这一点
I do, and if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that,

712
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:39,035
我会和你站在一起回答他们
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

713
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:42,052
我知道了
Okay.

714
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,072
让我先去跟他们碰一下头
Let me go talk to them.

715
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,018
是俄国人
They're Russian.

716
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,042
瓦德米尔肯定联系到了有浓缩铀棒的人
Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods.

717
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,042
他们只是不想让他知道
They just didn't want him to know.

718
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:17,001
这个耳机你拿着
Hold on to this.

719
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:18,065
你要干什么
What are you doing?

720
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:20,028
我要让他们带我走
I need to let them take me.

721
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,035
不  我们得离开这里
No. We have to get out of here.

722
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:27,018
听我说  你想要你之前的努力付诸东流吗
Listen to me. You want everything you've done so far to matter?

723
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,025
我必须这样做
I need to do this.

724
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:29,025
等反恐小组一到
When CTU gets here,

725
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:30,091
你叫他们用无人机追踪我
you tell them to start tracking me from the air.

726
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,075
我们就借这些人顺藤摸瓜
These people are gonna lead us to everything we're looking for.

727
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:33,098
他们会杀了你的
They will kill you.

728
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:36,035
不会  最多被严刑逼供
No. At worst, they're going to have to vet me,

729
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,078
看看我知道多少
find out how much I know.

730
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,028
但这会给我们争取足够的时间
It should buy us enough time.

731
00:38:43,038 --> 00:38:44,075
躲在这里
Hide in here.

732
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:48,022
拿着这个
Take this.

733
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,052
如果有人开门  你就开枪
If this door opens again, you start shooting.

734
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,034
这里出什么事了

735
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,034
有三具尸体

736
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:05,024
这他妈的是什么鬼东西

737
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,098
别开枪
Don't shoot!

738
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:08,015
别开枪
Please!

739
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,045

743
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,038
别开枪
Don't shoot.

744
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,058
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

745
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:21,016
发生了什么
What happened?!

746
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,059
他们想黑吃黑
They tried to rip me off.

747
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,008
但你们和我  我们可以做笔买卖
But you and I-- we can do business.

748
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,082
不  别开枪
No! Don' shoot.

749
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:28,092
如果你杀了我  
If you kill me,

750
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:30,062
你会让你老板损失一大笔钱
you're gonna cost your boss a lot of money.

751

没有  所有人都死了
No one. Everybody else is dead.

753
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,078
我只想做生意
All I want to do is business.

754
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,035
带他走

755
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:21,015
米哈伊尔
Mikhail!

756
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:22,017
我们走

757
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:23,074
来了

758
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,028
