《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,022
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

5
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:22,078
蕾妮
Renee!

6
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,097
蕾妮
Renee!

7
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,037
天哪
Oh, God...

8
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:32,081
你说你有一份视频文件能证明
You said you had video file implicating people inside

9
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,084
杀害蕾妮的是俄罗斯政府里的人
the Russian government who were responsible for Renee's murder.

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,081
我要那份文件
I want that file.

11
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:39,000
告诉我文件在哪  快说
You're gonna tell me where that file is, now!

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,055
在一个银行保险箱里
It's in a safety deposit box!

13
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,045
在哪
Where?

14
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,085
第一联合储蓄
First Unity Savings.

15
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:45,009
蕾妮的死跟我一点关系都没有  杰克
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.

16
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,032
别动
No.

17
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,016
你还想耍花招  不是吗
You never give up, do you?

18
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,027
也许沃什就在鲍尔手里
Bauer may have Walsh,

19
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,060
但他还没拿到证据
but he can't have the evidence yet.

20
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,060
我们还有机会阻止他
We've still got a chance to stop him.

21
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,064
不止我一人有证据证明
I'm not the only one who can prove that elements

22
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:09,054
贵国政府内有人阴谋破坏和平进程
in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.

23
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,037
所以你希望我来替你干掉杰克·鲍尔
So you expect me to kill Bauer for you?

24
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:14,038
你有专干这行的秘密杀手
You have the covert assets here to do the job.

25
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:16,011
或许我是有
Maybe I do.

26
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,058
但我没有相关资源来找到并跟踪他
But I don't have the resources to find him.

27
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,065
反恐小组有
CTU does.

28
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:22,066
而且那里负责搜捕的人现在都归我管
And the man in charge of the search now reports to me.

29
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,083
我们发现他了
We got him.

30
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,068
一旦他们抓到鲍尔
Once they have Bauer,

31
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,074
我就会得知他们把他关在哪里
I'll find out where they're holding him.

32
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,099
我们趁着他被关押干掉他
You'll have to take him out while he's in custody.

33
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,064
站住  警察
Freeze! Police!

34
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,059
不许动
Do not move.

35
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,078
杰克  告诉我  我还能做什么
Jack... tell me what I can do.

36
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,048
用不着
Nothing.

以下事件发生于中午十二点到一点间
The following takes place between 12:00 P.M. and 1:00 P.M.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,021
蒙德  我是沃莱基队长
Mund, this is Captain Walleki.

45
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,037
我在现场  你把那人从银行带过来了吗
I'm on scene. You got that guy from the bank yet?

46
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,091
报告队长  我正带他上来
Just bringing him up, Captain.

47
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,092
好的
Right.

48
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,003
他叫科尔·奥迪斯
His name's Cole Ortiz.

49
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,090
他说他是反恐小组的
And he says he's with CTU.

50
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:42,027
你当时和这个女人在银行
You were with this woman at the bank.

51
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,019
你能告诉我她是谁吗
You can tell me who she is?

52
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,088
她叫丹娜·沃什
Her name is Dana Walsh.

53
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,088
她被近距离射中两枪
Shot twice at close range

54
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,092
其中一枪  近弹孔处留有大量弹药残留物
lot of powder residue around one of the entries,

55
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,068
就像是被执行了死刑一样
like an execution.

56
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:02,050
谢了  蒙德  带他去反恐小组
Thank you, Mund. Get him to CTU,

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,011
现在就去
now.

58
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:22,034
刺杀哈桑的行动已万事俱备
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

59
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,074
巴扎耶夫及其手下正在处理一切
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.

60
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,004
很高兴听到这些
Well, I'm pleased to hear it,

61
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,095
但你打个电话告诉我不就行了
but you could have just as easily called to tell me that.

62
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,082
我想知道你是否已向上级请示
I wanted to know if you've spoken to your superiors...

63
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,029
这事一完我就金盆洗手了
told them that I'm out after this goes down.

64
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:41,016
我反映了你的要求
I told them what you wanted.

65
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,062
他和我的感受一样
He feels the same as me:

66
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:46,007
我们对你投入太多  不能让你就此退出
we have too much invested in you to let you walk away.

67
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:49,092
你应专注于把电磁脉冲设备带进反恐小组
You should be focused on getting the E.M.P. device into CTU,

68
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,083
而不是你的男友奥迪斯
not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.

69
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,031
他是我的未婚夫  我说了别把他卷进来
He's my fiance, and I told you to leave him out of this.

70
00:03:56,037 --> 00:04:01,034
我警告过你离他远点  但你不听
I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen.

71
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,095
现在你对他动真情了吗
And now you think you have feelings for him?

72
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,072
你觉得你爱上他了  要嫁给他吗
You think you love him, going to marry him?

73
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,079
是的
Yes.

74
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,059
我要嫁给他
I am.

75
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:16,016
如果你无法接受这个事实的话
And if you have a problem wrapping your brain around that fact,

76
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:20,010
也许我该找你莫斯科的头儿谈谈
maybe I should talk to your boss in Moscow.

77
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,090
你只能和我单线联系
You talk to no one but me.

78
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,020
就此打住
We're done here.

79
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:31,051
哈桑死之前不许再联系我
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.

80
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,010
喂
Yeah?

81
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,056
是我  给你发了一个dat格式的视频
Hey, it's me. I sent you a DAT video file.

82
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,091
收到了  正在上传
I got it. It's uploading right now.

83
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,028
我需要你帮我查出视频中那名男子的身份
Okay, I need you to get me an I.D. of the man in the video.

84
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,011
另外  我在逃亡中
Also, I'm coming in hot,

85
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:59,034
你必须想尽办法避免暴露你的系统
so whatever you have to do to protect your systems from getting flagged, do it now.

86
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,069
那个女人呢  也需要查明身份吗
What about the woman? You need an I.D. on her?

87
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,059
她已经死了  一会儿见
She's dead. I'll see you in a few minutes.

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,059
好吧
All right.

89
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,068
杰克·鲍尔最后出现在
Jack Bauer's last known location

90
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,081
莱克星敦市的第一联合储蓄银行
was First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington,

91
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:13,032
警方收到报警  显然是丹娜·沃什打的
where police responded to a 911 call, apparently from Dana Walsh.

92
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,002
现在她死了  鲍尔杀了她
She's dead now. Bauer killed her.

93
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:19,063
从犯科尔·奥迪斯协助了鲍尔
Cole Ortiz, who is known to be aiding and abetting Bauer

94
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,054
他正被带过来接受审讯
is being brought here for questioning.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,064
现在我需要大家别再管联合国安全事务了
Now, I need everybody not committed to the U.N. Security task

96
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,064
集中全部精力找到鲍尔
to devote their full attention to finding him.

97
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,004
我需要对所有的摄像头画面进行面部识别
I want all cameras routed through facial recognition

98
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,077
并监听所有的电话
and all phone calls monitored.

99
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,072
要是带宽不够
You don't have the bandwidth,

100
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,027
就从别的任务那里腾出来用
you steal it from other tasks.

101
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:36,080
要是发现任何线索  立刻向我汇报
If you think you have a lead, you bring it to me immediately.

102
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,073
有问题吗
Any questions?

103
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,084
他们为什么要去银行
Why did they go to the bank?

104
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,031
丹娜说过她有俄罗斯人刺杀哈桑的证据
Dana said she had evidence of Russian involvement in Hassan's murder.

105
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,001
也许她就把证据藏到那了
Maybe that's where she was stashing it.

106
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,051
根本没有证据  这一点总统已不予考虑
There's no evidence; the president dismissed this.

107
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,085
但她带着杰克去银行是为了去取东西
Well, she went to the bank with Jack to get something.

108
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:53,005
没错  她取的是个爆炸装置
Yeah, what she got was an explosive device

109
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,083
此装置能让她趁机逃跑
that made possible her escape.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,023
这自始至终就是她设计好了的
It was her plan all along.

111
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,094
听着  杰克·鲍尔不能接受
Look, Jack Bauer can't accept the fact

112
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:01,015
仅丹娜·沃什一人为伊斯兰共和国中
that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent working solely

113
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,088
哈桑政府的反对派们卖命这一事实
with the I.R.K. opposition to Hassan's government.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,022
蕾妮·沃克的被害让他悲痛至极
His... grief over Renee Walker's murder

115
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:10,051
导致他胡思乱想  认为这是俄当局的阴谋
is causing him to create this fantasy about a Russian conspiracy.

116
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:13,015
事实就这么简单  他失去了理智
The simple truth is, he's lost it,

117
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,005
他不仅危及自身  还危及整个社区
and he's a danger to himself and the community.

118
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,074
所以大家别再对本次行动充当事后诸葛了
So let's stop second-guessing the operation,

119
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,025
还是赶紧找到他吧
and find him.

120
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,083
事情越发不对劲了
Something is seriously wrong here.

121
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,037
皮勒正无视最关键的问题
Pillar's ignoring the key questions,

122
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,073
他根本就是在答非所问
and the questions that he is answering, no one's asking.

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,004
你想说什么
What are you getting at?

124
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,027
我认为杰克是对的
I think Jack's right:

125
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,021
这是个试图隐瞒真相的阴谋  皮勒也有份
this is a cover-up, and Pillar's involved.

126
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,021
银行里确实有证据  现在杰克拿到了
That evidence was at the bank, and Jack has it.

127
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,004
你敢确定吗
You don't know that.

128
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:45,025
都是猜测而已  可能事情就像皮勒说的那样
It's all speculation. It may be just like Pillar says.

129
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,051
除非我知道其它情况  否则我只按命令行事
Until I know otherwise, I got my orders.

130
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,088
没被发现
I'm clear.

131
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,082
你刚没开玩笑
Well, you weren't kidding.

132
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,042
你确实在逃亡中
You said you were coming in hot.

133
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,046
所有的警用步话机里都在讨论你
All the police scanners are talking about you.

134
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,089
他们说你射杀了一个女人
They said you shot and killed some woman.

135
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:02,010
就在东部贫民区的一个建筑工地
Construction site on the East Side.

136
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,073
是你发给我的视频里的那个女人吗
Is that the same woman in the video you sent me?

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,030
没错  查出那男人的身份了吗
Yeah. Did you I.D. the man?

138
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,017
没有  除非你告诉我到底发生什么了
No. I'm not going to, either...

139
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,097
否则我不帮你查他的身份  杰克
till you tell me what the hell is going on, Jack.

140
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,017
你看过那段视频了
You saw the video.

141
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,061
丹娜·沃什是俄罗斯间谍
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.

142
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:17,010
她协助了此次暗杀哈桑总统行动和核弹袭击事件
She facilitated the assassination of President Hassan and the dirty bomb attack

143
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,011
要是我们没及时阻止  整个上西区都将被夷为平地
that would have wiped out the entire Upper West Side if we hadn't stopped it.

144
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:23,010
我不关心也不想知道今天发生什么了
I don't want to know about what happened today, and I don't care;

145
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,090
我想知道为何你一个人单枪匹马
I want to know why you're out there on your own

146
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,030
为什么大家都在抓你
and why everybody's after you.

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,008
因为总统想把我关起来
Because the president tried to lock me down.

148
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,083
-为什么  -因为我知道她试图掩盖
- Why?  - Because I know she's trying to cover up

149
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,023
今天的袭击与俄方有关这一真相
the Russian's involvement in today's attack.

150
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,097
那你干嘛不逃之夭夭
Then why didn't you disappear?

151
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,017
因为我办不到
Because I can't!

152
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:40,004
听着  杰克  我想帮你
Listen, I want to help you, Jack.

153
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,028
真的想
I really do.

154
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,048
我要你对我开诚布公
I need you to be straight with me.

155
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:45,095
实话告诉我到底发生什么了
Tell me exactly what's going on.

156
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,073
俄罗斯人夺走了我的所爱
The Russians took something from me.

157
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:04,037
她叫蕾妮·沃克
Her name was Renee Walker.

158
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,045
他们就在我的公寓里杀害了她
They killed her inside my apartment.

159
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,057
我要让他们血债血偿
And I need to make them pay.

160
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,005
好吧
All right.

161
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,072
事实上  我确实查出了那个人的身份
Actually, I did I.D. the guy.

162
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,096
就是他  帕维尔·托卡列夫
There he is: Pavel Tokarev.

163
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:34,011
俄情报部门首席特工
Primary operative, Russian intelligence.

164
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,078
他现在在哪
Where is he?

165
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,079
具体我也不清楚
I don't know exactly.

166
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,042
目前在美国境内
He's in the USA.

167
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,089
一月以前靠外交签证入境的
Came in a month ago on a diplomatic visa.

168
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,040
外交签证  
Diplomat.

169
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,029
我试图访问俄大使馆的数据库
I tried to access the Russian database in the embassy.

170
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,026
他没在领事馆出现过
He didn't show up in the consulate.

171
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,083
所以说不好他在哪  杰克
He could be anywhere, Jack.

172
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:57,041
为保密起见  他们必须得小队行动对吧
To keep everything quiet, they'd have to be a small unit, right?

173
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,085
对
Yeah.

174
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:01,044
我有办法了
I think I've got an idea.

175
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,027
给我接条安全线路
Get me a secure line.

176
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:07,048
梅瑞狄斯  没想到你还在这
Meredith. I didn't expect you'd still be here.

177
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:11,025
还有几个关于哈桑的新闻发布稿要审校
Oh, fact check called: there are a few items left on the Hassan piece.

178
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,093
艾比可以帮你继续跟进报道啊
Abby can follow up on it for you.

179
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,092
我知道  只是...我想确保一切都没问题
I know. I just... I need to make sure it's right.

180
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,089
我知道他对你很重要
I know what he meant to you.

181
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,033
从你写的这篇文章就看得出来
It shows in this piece you wrote.

182
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,046
他的确是个伟人
What a great man he was.

183
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:27,006
你已经还他公正了
You've done him justice.

184
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,067
希望如此
I hope so.

185
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:33,077
-里德小姐  3号线有你的电话  -谢谢
- Miss Reed, there's a call for you on 3. - Thank you.

186
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:36,023
如有何需要  请尽管告诉我
Let me know if there's anything you need.

187
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,034
谢谢  加里
Thanks, Gary.

188
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,035
我是梅瑞狄斯·里德
This is Meredith Reed.

189
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,042
里德小姐
Miss Reed.

190
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,046
-你是谁  -我叫杰克·鲍尔
-Who is this? -My name is Jack Bauer.

191
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,019
请别声张  听我说
Please don't say anything; just listen.

192
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,038
那些你认为该对哈桑总统的死负责的人
The people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan

193
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,083
他们不是单打独斗
were not working alone.

194
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,030
他们得到俄当局内部人士的资助
They were being funded and managed

195
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,007
并受他们操纵
by people working inside the Russian government.

196
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,074
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

197
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,061
我有证据  是打入反恐组内部的
I have proof of this: a video file that was made

198
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,022
俄方间谍留下的一个视频文件
by a Russian agent working out of CTU.

199
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,080
她做这文件的初衷是为求自保
She made it for her own protection.

200
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,098
视频可以解释过去24小时发生的一切
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.

201
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,086
你和当局取得联系了吗
Have you contacted the authorities about any of this?

202
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,062
我不能去  我被人陷害了  就像你昨天一样
I can't. I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.

203
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,052
我得把这证据交给你
I need to get this evidence to you.

204
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,003
特纳百货公司3楼  有一间咖啡厅
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.

205
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,086
你看20分钟内你能赶到吗
Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes?

206
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,056
里德小姐
Miss Reed...

207
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:26,077
昨天是我帮你洗脱了罪名
yesterday I helped clear your name.

208
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,057
现在该你帮我洗清冤屈了
Right now I need you to help clear mine.

209
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,077
拜托了
Please.

210
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:33,011
我当然会帮你
Of course I'll help you.

211
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,094
我也和你一样迫切想要了解真相
I-I want to know the truth as much as you do.

212
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,054
谢谢
Thank you.

213
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,036
谢谢
Thank you.

214
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,083
请坐
Take a seat.

215
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,024
鲍尔在哪
Where's Bauer?

216
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,034
不知道
I don't know.

217
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,048
你现在麻烦大了  科尔
You're in some trouble here, Cole.

218
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:12,081
我想你应该清楚
I assume you're aware of that.

219
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,005
不过幸运的是
Luckily for you,

220
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:17,012
我能解决你所有的麻烦
I'm in a position to make all that go away.

221
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,082
我看过你的档案
I reviewed your record.

222
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,029
到目前为止  简直可以说是模范
You've had a exemplary career up to now.

223
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,086
你就是皮勒
You're Pillar.

224
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,039
没错
That's right.

225
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,059
杰森·皮勒
Jason Pillar.

226
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,003
我受命于总统  负责监督缉捕杰克的行动
I've been asked by the president to oversee the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer.

227
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,040
总统阁下
Madam President?

228
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:32,000
对
Yes.

229
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:34,080
这么说你也是帮忙掩盖真相的
So you're a part of the cover-up?

230
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,061
我看到档案里写道  你在费卢杰服过役
Oh, I see here you served in Fallujah.

231
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,071
我本人也曾两度
I-I spent two tours

232
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,018
指挥过驻巴古拜的海军陆战队行动小组
in command of a marine unit in Baquba myself.

233
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,075
我们都是军人
We're both soldiers.

234
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,047
所以你应该明白  当最高统帅
So you understand, when the commander-in-chief

235
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:54,012
认为此次行动是为了国家利益
deems a course of action necessary to the national good,

236
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,016
那我们就无权质疑
it's not our place to question it.

237
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,099
事实上  我们是同一阵营的
The truth is: we're on the same side.

238
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,030
我们都是为了国家至高利益考虑
We both want what's best for our country.

239
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:03,066
鲍尔才不关心那些
Bauer doesn't care about that.

240
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,063
他对你的遭遇也丝毫不在乎
He didn't give a damn about what happened to you,

241
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,090
只要满足了他的需求即可
just as long as it served his needs.

242
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,010
他利用了你
He used you.

243
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,094
我再问你一次
So let's start over.

244
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,054
你知道杰克·鲍尔在哪吗
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

245
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,065
可能在某处吧  手里掌握着你们
Probably somewhere with the evidence you guys

246
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,079
想极力掩盖的证据
keep saying doesn't exist.

247
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,072
跟我耍花招没有好下场的
You really don't want to be playing with me.

248
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,026
什么事
What?

249
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,019
好消息  我们可能有鲍尔的线索了
Good news, we may have a line on Bauer.

250
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:36,090
我们窃听到一个电话
We intercepted a call.

251
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,040
最后一次机会
Last chance.

252
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:45,047
如果再执迷不悟  谁也救不了你
You don't take it, there's nothing anyone can do for you.

253
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,065
把他带走收押
Take him to holding.

254
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,066
阿洛从国安局梯队情报系统获得了
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report

255
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,002
一份手机监听报告
of NSA's Echelon.

256
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,052
关键词是  哈桑  俄罗斯政府  杰克·鲍尔
Key words are Hassan, Russian government, Jack Bauer.

257
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,056
-阿洛听到对话内容了吗  -暂时还没
- Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? - No, not yet--

258
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,098
目前他只是在处理数据
all he's got so far are the data handles,

259
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,048
但他已经在进行声音识别了
but he's processing the voice matrix now.

260
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:10,053
能确定是鲍尔吗
Are we sure it's Bauer?

261
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,083
暂时还不能  但是电话的另外一方
No, not yet, but the other side of the call

262
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,053
登记的是  梅瑞狄斯·里德
was a phone registered to Meredith Reed.

263
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
她是反恐组昨晚抓的那名记者
She's the reporter CTU arrested last night

264
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,047
是在第一次暗杀哈桑之前抓的
before the first attempt on Hassan's life.

265
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,011
有传言说她是哈桑的情妇
Rumor has it she was also his mistress.

266
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,021
如果鲍尔要把证据交给其他人的话
If Bauer was going to reach out to someone with the evidence,

267
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,071
她肯定是首选
she would be an excellent choice.

268
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,074
阿洛  先放下手头的工作
Arlo, stop what you're doing.

269
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:26,017
给监听内容做好警示标记并加密上锁
Tag and lock the intercept download

270
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,078
然后直接传到伊登的系统里
and send it directly to Eden's system.

271
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,078
-由她来接手  -没必要  长官
- She'll take it from there. - That's not necessary, sir.

272
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:31,068
我叫你让伊登来处理  谢了  阿洛
I said I want Eden to handle it. Thanks, Arlo.

273
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,025
有一个视频文件
There's a video file that was made

274
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,089
是打入反恐组内部的俄方间谍留下的
by a Russian agent working out of CTU.

275
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,074
她做这文件的初衷是为求自保
She made it for her own protection.

276
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:03,020
视频可以解释过去24小时发生的一切
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.

277
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,025
你和当局取得联系了吗
Have you contacted the authorities about any of this?

278
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,057
我不能去  我被人陷害  就像你昨天一样
I can't. I'm being set up just like you were yesterday.

279
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,049
我得把这证据交给你
I need to get this evidence to you.

280
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,038
特纳百货公司3楼  有一间咖啡厅
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.

281
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,098
你看20分钟内你能赶到吗
Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes?

282
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,002
是杰克·鲍尔
Jack Bauer.

283
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,066
我们确定了声纹
We confirmed the voiceprint.

284
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,082
这么说...
So...

285
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,060
他下一步棋就是把证据送媒体曝光
take it to the press-- that's his next move.

286
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,097
看来是的
It appears to be.

287
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:24,034
以里德与哈桑的关系
Reed's connection to Hassan means

288
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,003
她打心眼里愿意帮助杰克
she'd be highly motivated to help him.

289
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,070
杰克还没给她看过什么  对吧
And he hasn't shown her anything yet?

290
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,031
-没有  长官  -那就是说
- No, sir. - Which still means that we,

291
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:32,075
我们仍然不知道到底是什么证据
we don't know what the evidence actually is.

292
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:34,080
反正我们很快就会把证据搞到手的
Well, it will be in our hands soon enough.

293
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,085
这是一个扫除一切障碍的大好时机  长官
This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir.

294
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,039
鲍尔和证据
Bauer and the evidence.

295
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,065
我已经派遣了俄方行动小组前往那里
I've already dispatched the Russian ops team to the location.

296
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,043
他们会在杰克和里德见面之前就位
They'll be in position well before the meet.

297
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,041
你得摆平当地的执法部门
You need to deal with local law enforcement,

298
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,037
确保帕维尔能施展拳脚
make sure Pavel has room to move.

299
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,067
我们正把纽约警局的人调离那里
Yes, we're deploying NYPD away from the site,

300
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,084
但我们仍需要你们的人尽可能地速战速决
but we'll still need your guys in and out as quickly as possible.

301
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,096
明白了
Understood.

302
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:57,039
杰森  这是你们取得的重大突破
Jason, this is, this is a major break you've got,

303
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,021
这是决定性的突破
a major break.

304
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,074
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

305
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,037
我们会把事办妥的
We'll shut this down.

306
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:05,011
我想亲自监督此事  米哈伊尔
I want to stay on top of this personally, Mikhail.

307
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,071
你能把帕维尔的电话号码给我吗
So will you let me have Pavel's number?

308
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,074
能让这房间有点私密空间吗
Can you make this room less public?

309
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,049
你找我有何吩咐吗
You wanted me for something?

310
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,012
对  你拦截到的那个电话
Yeah, the call you intercepted--

311
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,056
就是皮勒强行插手的那个
the one that Pillar hijacked--

312
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,062
你觉得是杰克打来的吗
do you think it was from Jack?

313
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,096
无法确定
I can't be sure.

314
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,059
程序筛选出的关键词是  哈桑  核  鲍尔
The program hit on keywords Hassan, nuclear, Bauer,

315
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,073
但这三个词在过去几小时内都在新闻上出现过
but all three have been in the news in the last few hours.

316
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,043
可这电话是打给梅瑞狄斯·里德手机的
But the call was to Meredith Reed's cell phone.

317
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,080
她是一名追踪报道哈桑人物传记的记者
She's a journalist with an interest in the Hassan story.

318
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,013
所以有很多人会给她打电话
Plenty of people could be calling her.

319
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,057
不一定非得是杰克
Doesn't have to be Jack.

320
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,050
好吧  那这个怎么解释
Okay, then explain this.

321
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,060
电话截获报告刚发到这里
Cell intercept report comes in here.

322
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,044
而两分钟之后
Two minutes later

323
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,031
皮勒就把整个对话录音下载到一个独立服务器
Pillar downloads the entire conversation into a segregated server

324
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,094
并且安装有我从未见过的防火墙
surrounded by firewalls like I've never seen.

325
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,000
知道他后来又做了什么吗
Then what does he do?

326
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,078
拨出了  一个  两个  三个电话
Call one, call two, call three.

327
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,097
机主: 皮勒  保密线路
Pillar Restricted

328
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,008
他会打给谁
Who'd he call?

329
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,055
我不知道
I don't know.

330
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,082
均超出了反恐组的监控范围  且全部加密
They're outside of CTU and they're all completely masked.

331
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,016
所以现在问题是  如果这电话无关紧要
So the question is this: if the call was nothing,

332
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:10,059
那他们为什么还要掩饰
then why are they still hiding it?

333
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,086
若这电话是杰克打来的  
If the call was Jack,

334
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,026
那他们为何还不派出反恐组特警队
then why haven't they dispatched CTU SWAT team?

335
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,013
又为何不向纽约警局发警报
Why haven't they alerted NYPD?

336
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,014
阿洛  他们也参与了企图掩盖真相的阴谋
Arlo, they're in on the cover-up.

337
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,040
看看他们
Look at them.

338
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
更糟的是  他们正打算干掉杰克
What's worse is, they're planning on taking Jack out.

339
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,025
为什么  为什么他们要那么做
Why? Why would they want to do that?

340
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,068
因为他知道的太多了
Because he knows too much.

341
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,015
他已拿到了丹娜的证据
He's gotten a hold of Dana's evidence,

342
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,068
从而证明俄当局介入了暗杀哈桑的行动
which proves the Russian involvement in Hassan's assassination.

343
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,055
他们不能让他把真相公之于众
They can't let him go public with that.

344
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,020
因此我要找到他  而我需要你的帮助
That's why I have to find him, and I need your help.

345
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,040
好吧
Okay.

346
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,027
你想怎么干
How do you want to do it?

347
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,054
我要去跟科尔谈谈
I'm gonna talk to Cole.

348
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,030
在过去两小时里  他一直跟杰克和丹娜在一起
He just spent the past two hours with Jack and Dana.

349
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:56,074
他一定知道杰克想干什么
He must have some idea of what Jack's up to.

350
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,041
皮勒在时刻监视科尔
Pillar's got Cole continuously monitored.

351
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,004
你不可能偷着溜进去的
You can't get in there without being seen.

352
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,078
我们来剪辑一段循环视频
We'll create a loop

353
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,061
插入到监控录像的信号中
and graft it into the security feed.

354
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,098
我们就会碰到另一个问题
That's the other problem:

355
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,023
他们在我们系统上增加了一层额外的监控
they added an extra layer of oversight to our system.

356
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,045
我试图进行超越我安全许可的操作时
Second I try to move beyond my security clearance,

357
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,022
我屏幕上就会出现警告
I get an on-screen warning.

358
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,089
他们在监视着我们的一举一动
They're watching everything we're doing.

359
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,096
那好吧
Okay, fine.

360
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:25,060
我们这么办  创建一个无线信号发射点
We'll use this, create a mobile hot spot.

361
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:30,051
那样我们就可以用独立网络而不用受皮勒监视 
That way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks.

362
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,064
明白
Got it.

363
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,049
正在配置备用网络
Setting up alternate network now.

364
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,079
接入网络了
We're up.

365
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:49,076
好了  我正在限制对你我的访问
Okay, I'm restricting access to you and me.

366
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,086
循环录像的时长是多长
How long will it take you to make the loop?

367
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:54,013
只能给你90秒的时间
I can only give you 90 seconds.

368
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,050
一超时  就会有人发现
Anything more than that, somebody will notice.

369
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,093
好吧  你设置好了给我发信息
Okay, text me when you're set up.

370
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,025
画面起始及循环点已记录 
Start Loop Point Logged

371
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,090
录制中  最大时长  90秒
Recording: 90 Seconds Maximum Time Allowed

372
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:32,004
弗雷德里克斯  麦克德蒙特被电磁脉冲弹炸伤了
Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E.M.P. Blast,

373
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,017
我需要你把夜班卡给我收好
so I need you to collect the night shift time cards

374
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,041
送到我办公室来
and take them to my office.

375
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,011
好的
Okay.

376
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,058
可否现在就去
Like now?

377
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,048
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,009
你有90秒的行动时间  -阿洛
You're clear for 90 seconds. -Arlo

379
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,000
我们给监控信号插入了循环录像
We put a loop in the security feed.

380
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,013
我只有90秒时间
I've only got 90 seconds,

381
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,077
所以我得直扑主题
so I'm gonna get straight to the point.

382
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,023
我要找到杰克
I need to find Jack

383
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,010
-不然他们会杀了他  -谁要杀他
- or else they're gonna kill him.  - Who's gonna kill him?

384
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,029
皮勒和他的部下
Pillar and whoever is working with him.

385
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,050
你得告诉我他在哪
You need to tell me where he is.

386
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,032
我不知道
I got no idea.

387
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,024
你和他都在银行  
You were at the bank with him;

388
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,041
他一定说过什么
he must have said something.

389
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:14,091
听着  杰克出尔反尔说一套做一套
Hey, what Jack says and what he does are two very different things.

390
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,018
他要去揭穿阴谋  披露真相
He's trying to expose the cover-up.

391
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,058
他才不管什么企图掩盖真相的阴谋呢
He doesn't give a damn about any cover-up.

392
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:22,012
他要把所有与蕾妮的死有关的人统统杀光
He's taking out anyone who was anywhere near Renee's death,

393
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,095
首先拿丹娜开刀
starting with Dana.

394
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,031
她已经给了他证据  可他还是杀了她
She gave him the evidence and he killed her anyway.

395
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,096
她拿了保险箱里的枪
She took the gun out of the safety deposit box.

396
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,080
他朝她近距离平射
He shot her point-blank.

397
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,062
杰克处决了她  正如她所预料的
He executed her, just like she said he would.

398
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,094
整件事里根本就没有好人
There are no good guys here.

399
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,070
杰克  皮勒  让他们互相残杀
Jack, Pillar... they end up killing each other,

400
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,094
也许才是最好的结局
maybe it's the best thing.

401
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,084
不行  杰克是我的朋友
No, Jack's my friend.

402
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,031
如果我能找到他  我就能说服他
If I can find him, I can talk him down.

403
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,048
而这些人只会去要他的命
These people are just going to kill him.

404
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,012
我需要你站在我一边
I need you to be on my side.

405
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,098
所有人都想要拉拢我
Everybody wants me on their side.

406
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,069
我却又为谁而战呢
Who am I fighting for?

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,086
如果我们能找到他  
If we can get to him,

408
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:02,039
我们就能揭穿这个掩盖真相的阴谋
we can expose the cover-up.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,060
你就待在这里继续自我忏悔吧
You just stay here and feel sorry for yourself.

410
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,040
我自己去找他
I'm gonna go find him.

411
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,043
等等
Wait.

412
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:17,004
听着  我知道的不多  杰克可能有个帮手
Look, it's not much, but Jack's got to be working with someone.

413
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,017
谁
Who?

414
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,034
我不知道  我没见过他
I don't know; I never saw him,

415
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,070
但从杰克配备有最尖端的武器和通讯系统判断
but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms,

416
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,078
他一定在城里有联络人
so he's got to have a contact in the city.

417
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:24,088
你要想找到杰克
You want to find Jack,

418
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,065
得先找到这个帮手
you find his supplier.

419
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:27,072
谢谢
Thanks.

420
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,076
阿洛
Arlo.

421
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,056
出来得很及时  你没事吧
You got out in time. You okay?

422
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:37,045
是的  我没事  
Yeah, I'm okay.

423
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:38,063
听着  我知道杰克的动向了
Listen, I know what Jack's doing.

424
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,053
调出他的档案  把他在三州交界的联系人
Pull up his files, get me the list of his known associates in the tri-state area,

425
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,077
还有他以前的同事的名单给我
anyone he's worked with in the past.

426
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,077
好的
Okay.

427
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,080
在接下来的半小时里
In the next half hour,

428
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,084
被广泛认为是和平协议的
the man who has widely been acknowledged

429
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,057
"关键的第三方"人物
as the vital "Third partner" in the peace process--

430
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,078
俄国总统尤里·萨瓦洛夫
Russian President Yuri Suvarov--

431
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,061
将飞抵肯尼迪国际机场
will touch down at JFK.

432
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,065
他将转乘直升机前往曼哈顿
He'll be ferried into Manhattan by helicopter

433
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,072
之后会前往联合国大厦
and then to the U.N.

434
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,097
喂
Yes.

435
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,010
帕维尔  请报告最新情况
Pavel, update, please.

436
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:20,027
我的小队已就位
My team is in position.

437
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,098
发现鲍尔了吗
Any sign of Bauer?

438
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,065
还没有
Not yet.

439
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,098
我需要知道
I need to know.

440
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:30,008
怎么处理那女人
What about the woman?

441
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,028
那女人
The woman?

442
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:35,049
就是那个记者  怎么处置她
The journalist, her disposition.

443
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,005
里德女士一直协助和煽动恐怖活动
Ms. Reed is aiding and abetting a terrorist.

444
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:40,076
她对我们两国都是个严重的威胁
She's a serious threat to both our countries.

445
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,066
你看着办
Do what you have to.

446
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:19,040
我从伊桑的笔记上看到我们仍未彻底解决
I see from Ethan's notes that we still have not completely resolved

447
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,022
检查团通行许可的问题
the issue of site access for the inspection teams.

448
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:24,005
我认为这问题已经解决了
I believe it was resolved.

449
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,026
哈桑总统同意了
President Hassan agreed

450
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,062
观察员将获得在全国的通行许可
the inspectors would have right of passage over our entire country.

451
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,047
但是他将学校列在范围之外
But he exempted schools.

452
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:31,088
只有小学
Only primary schools.

453
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:33,031
奥马可不认为
Omar didn't think

454
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,048
10岁小孩会去造核弹
ten-year-old children would be building nuclear missiles.

455
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,092
当然不会
Of course.

456
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,022
我想起来了
I remember now.

457
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,055
我深表歉意

458

464
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,058
当然可以
Of course.

465
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,030
他在哪
Where is he?

466
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,087
他在会议室  总统阁下
He's in the conference room, ma'am.

467
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,095
感谢您能和我见面  总统阁下
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.

468
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,002
我有好消息

469
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,025
我们掌握了鲍尔的方位
We've located Bauer.

470
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,021
我手里有证据  但...
He-He has the evidence, but...

471
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,035
查尔斯  你向我保证过
Charles, you assured me

472
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,052
事情不会走到这一步
that that wouldn't happen.

473
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,072
请让我说完
Please, let me finish.

474
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,048
我们知道鲍尔将会现身的确切位置
We know exactly where Bauer will be

475
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,026
和确切时间  而且此时此刻
and when, and-and we have an operation underway

476
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,071
我们已经展开了对他的抓捕行动了
to reacquire him even as we speak.

477
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:37,079
相信我  这是个好消息
Believe me, this is good news.

478
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:43,037
事情一完就立刻通知我

00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,081
我要回去谈判了
I need to get back to the negotiations.

480
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:48,038
还有件事  总统阁下
Just... There's just one thing, Madam President.

481
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:53,034
还有三个小时就要签署条约
Uh, we are three hours away from the signing of the treaty.

482
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:58,009
我在这次和平进程中扮演的角色
Isn't it time for my role in the process

483
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,092
是否该获得官方承认了
to be officially recognized?

484
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,076
我在想的是类似于...
I was thinking some kind of, uh,

485
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,051
向媒体发布一份声明
announcement to the media,

486
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:08,026
或许由您的新闻秘书发布
perhaps by your press secretary,

487
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,070
甚至由您亲自宣布也可以  总统阁下
or maybe even by you yourself, Madam President.

488
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,084
您该记得我们协商好
It was, you'll recall, our agreement

489
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,084
我会以官方身份出现在这历史性的一天
that I would have a public face on this historic day.

490
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:24,081
我相信这是我应得的
I believe I've earned it.

491
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:32,015
我会告诉我的新闻秘书
I will talk to my press secretary.

492
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:36,062
她会在一点的新闻上及时发表这份声明
She will make the announcement in time for the 1:00 o'clock news.

493
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,073
非常感谢  总统阁下
Thank you very much, Madam President.

发现他了  他正要去...
There he is. He's heading up towards...

鲍尔从西南角处  快接近目标了

帕维尔  他已在视线范围内

他快要到咖啡厅了
He's closing in on the cafe.

523

你应该已对他有清晰的瞄准视野了

524

帕维尔  有机会就开枪

照我说的做

531
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,014

532
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:10,048
-蹲在这  别动  -好的

00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:35,084

他知道这是个陷阱

别让他们脱离视线
Don't let them out of your sight.

538
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,016
我们跟丢他了
We lost him.

539
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,019
继续找
Just keep looking!

540
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:50,055
你开枪杀的是些什么人
Those people you shot-- who were they?

541
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:53,002
-俄国间谍  你有问题吗  -没有

542
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:57,065
我们走
Let's move.

543
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,030
杰森  说吧
Jason. Tell me.

544
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,093
恐怕我得告诉您一个坏消息  长官
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.

545
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,034
帕维尔的小队全军覆没
All of Pavel's team is dead,

546
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,047
帕维尔也被鲍尔抓走了
and Bauer has Pavel.

547
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:32,047
他从一开始就比我们捷足先登  长官
He was ahead of us from the get-go, sir.

548
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:34,021
他肯定早料到我们会使用梯形情报系统
He must have anticipated that we'd use Echelon,

549
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:36,011
然后他设计了一系列关键词
and he put out a series of keywords,

550
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,068
并料到监听站会截获这些关键词
knowing the listening stations would pick them up.

551
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,085
他耍了我们  长官
He played us, sir.

552
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,055
他知道我们会动用非常规人员来对付他
He knew we'd use off-book resources to deal with him.

553
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:44,059
他利用那个记者引蛇出洞
He used that journalist to draw them out.

554
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:48,034
长官  现在情况的严重性已不言而喻
Now, sir, I hardly need to tell you that the situation is grave.

555
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,078
帕维尔知道一切
Pavel knows everything.

556
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,050
他安插了沃什  他主导了俄方的一系列行动
He ran Walsh, he set up the Russian ops.

557
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,016
要是鲍尔撬开了帕维尔的嘴...
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk...

558
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,064
但目前来说  长官
But at the moment, sir,

559
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,044
您仍然可以否认一切
you still have complete deniability.

560
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,054
所有的决定都是泰勒总统作出的
President Taylor made all the decisions.

561
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:07,038
我觉得现在是时候
I think the time has come

562
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:10,038
让您远离是非了
for you to distance yourself from this mess.

563
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:12,038
虽然非常的遗憾  长官
It's regrettable, sir, deeply so,

564
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,014
但我觉得这是目前对您最好的选择
but I believe it's what's best for you.

565
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:15,050
你...  
You...

566
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,079
二十分钟后
20 minutes from now,

567
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:21,079
总统的新闻秘书
the president's press secretary

568
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:23,001
就要发表一份声明
is going to make an announcement.

569
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,029
她会宣布...
She will say...

570
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,040
我已成为总统政府的一员
I have become part of the president's team,

571
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:30,080
在让和平进程功德圆满的过程中
and-and I have been indispensable in bringing this peace process

572
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,047
我发挥了无可取代的作用
to a successful close.

573
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,047
长官  请原谅我告诉您这是个坏主意
Sir, may I say that that is a bad idea?

574
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:35,094
您现在得远离是非
You need to distance yourself.

575
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,084
什么  你一直在用那个词
What? You keep using that phrase.

576
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,051
什么叫远离是非
What-What does distance myself mean?

577
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:41,004
是要我偷偷溜走吗
Do I just slink away?

578
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,077
有些情况是我们始料未及的
There were circumstances we couldn't have anticipated.

579
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:44,067
也就是鲍尔
Namely Bauer.

580
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,085
那就找到他  干掉他
Well, then, we find Bauer, and we neutralize him.

581
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:51,039
我们从幕后走向了台前  杰森
We're public now, Jason.

582
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:53,026
我们致力于此
We're committed.

583
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:56,083
而且我已经...  是我们
And I have worked... We...

584
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:59,016
我们已经付诸了太多心血
We have worked too hard

585
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:01,000
不能让其付之东流
just to throw this all away.

586
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:02,016
你明白了吗
Do you understand?

587
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,060
-当然  长官  但是帕维尔...  -不
- Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel... - No.

588
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,044
帕维尔是出色的战士
Pavel is a good soldier.

589
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,074
无论鲍尔怎么拷问  他都不会招供的
He won't talk, whatever Bauer does to him.

590
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:15,092
我让你进反恐小组  是有原因的  杰森
I, uh... I put you at CTU, Jason, for a reason.

591
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,045
他们拥有丰富的资源

592
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,028
而你有勇有谋
You have intelligence and tenacity.

593
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:25,035
利用好这一切  找到鲍尔
You use those capabilities. Find Bauer.

594
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:27,012
是  长官

-我会亲自前往现场  -很好

596
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,050
随时向我报告
Keep me posted.

597
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,067
他想继续下去
He wants to move forward.

598
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,097
他真的明白现在的状况吗
Does he understand what actually happened?

599
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:44,021
是的  但他说我们仍有选择的余地
Yes, but he says we still have options.

600
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:50,021
告诉我  你会跟我同舟共济
I need to know you're with me on this.

601
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:53,095
是的  同舟共济

602
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,009
好  我要出去了
Good. I'm heading out.

603
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:58,015
我会清理现场留下的一切俄罗斯人的证据
I'll clean up the scene, remove all trace of the Russians,

604
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,045
然后设法找到鲍尔的下落
and get on Bauer's trail.

605
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,002
我会带上反恐小组的特警队
I'll take CTU SWAT with me.

606
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,047
命令纽约警局以商店为圆心警戒周围两个街区
Tell NYPD to put a two-block perimeter around the store.

607
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:05,001
没有我的命令不得让任何人出入
No one goes in or out without my say-so.

608
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,017
我该以什么理由命令他们
What reason do I give them?

609
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,074
如有任何人阻挠  就以白宫的名义行使权力
Anyone gives you a hard time, invoke the White House.

610
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,058
有杰克帮手的线索了吗
Any luck with Jack's associates?

611
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:20,098
没有  即使排除死去的人
No. Even discounting dead people,

612
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:22,017
以及外国人
and people from foreign countries,

613
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,040
还是得花上几个小时
it's still going to take hours.

614
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,041
我可以缩小范围
I think I can narrow it down.

615
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,096
我刚监听到市中心特纳百货公司
I just picked up a 911 call

616
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,029
打来的一个报警电话
from Turner's in Midtown.

617
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,083
那里发生了枪击事件  造成了人员伤亡
There was a shoot-out, people killed.

618
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,027
我成功进入了那家商店的监控系统
I managed to get into the store's security system.

619
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,019
天哪  
Oh, my God.

620
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:39,021
是杰克
That's Jack.

621
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,058
他们想杀他
They're trying to kill him.

622
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:44,011
是的  不过计划没有成功
Yeah, that part of the plan didn't go so well.

623
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,001
我对监控录像从枪战开始前五分钟
I tagged the footage 5 minutes before

624
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,058
到结束后五分钟做了标记
to 5 minutes after the shooting.

625
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,062
如果我们对录像中的人进行面部识别
If we run facial recognition on the camera feeds...

626
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,022
就能与杰克帮手们的数据库进行比对
We can match it to the database of Jack's associates,

627
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,052
也许就能找出杰克是和谁联手了
maybe find out who he's working with.

628
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,099
多谢  阿洛
Thanks, Arlo.

629
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:58,016
不客气
No problem.

630
00:31:58,023 --> 00:31:59,057
把那些录像画面复制到我屏幕上
Copy the camera footage to my screen.

631
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:01,037
我会把一半的人员档案发给你
I'll send you half the personnel files.

632
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,045

We're clear. Let's go.

633
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,040

00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,028
坐下
Take a seat.

636
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,086
在这我们暂时是安全的
We'll be safe here for a while.

637
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:53,018
杰克  我们时间不多
Jack? We don't have much time.

638
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,068
脱下你的外套
Take off your coat.

639
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,021
快
Now!

640
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,025
你刚杀的那些人...
Those people you killed...

641
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,001
你准备好要杀他们  是吗
you were ready for them, weren't you?

642
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:10,035
你早知道他们会来的
You knew they were coming.

643
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,038
是的
Yeah.

644
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:15,052
那你  你早知道他们会窃听我们的电话
So you... you knew they'd be listening to our phone call.

645
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,082
是这样吗
Isn't that right?

646
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:22,069
你利用我引他们出来  对吗
You used me to draw them out, right?

647
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,003
是的
That's right.

648
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,017
我可能会死在那里
I could have been killed back there!

649
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,013
你没死
You weren't.

650
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:31,060
快捡起来
Now, pick it up.

651
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:33,086
我叫你把它捡起来
I said pick it up!

652
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,003
你说过要给我证据
What about the evidence you said you'd tell me?

653
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,017
那也是谎言  是不是
Was that a lie, too?

654
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,054
不是
No.

655
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:44,088
证据在这张记忆卡里

我搭档会带你去个地方  给你看

659
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,086
我很抱歉  是我不得已而为之
I'm sorry things had to play out like this.

660
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,006
我别无选择
I didn't see another choice.

661
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,083
那你接着要干什么
What are you gonna do?

662
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,040
把双手放到背后  快
Put your hands behind your back. Now!

663
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,072
不要这么做  求你  你不想这么做的

00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,087
求你了  你不能这样做
Please, you cannot do this.

667
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,037
我给你的证据
The evidence I gave you

668
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:19,062
没能告诉我沃什是怎么卷入这勾当的
doesn't tell me how Walsh was involved.

669
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,056
他能告诉我
He will.

670
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,004
-走吧  -不
- Come on. - No.

671
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,026
你不能这样做
You cannot do this this way!

672
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,081
坐在那
Sit over there.

673
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:41,043
春田造M1A式步枪

674
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:46,014
点308口径弹药

675
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:52,008
约四小时之前
You know, about four hours ago,

676
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:57,012
我的一个朋友  一个非常要好的朋友
I had a friend of mine-- very good friend--

677
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,089
名叫蕾妮·沃克  就死在这型号的枪下
named Renee Walker was killed by a rifle just like that.

678
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:02,073
去死吧
Go to hell.

679
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:12,034
我先送你一程
You first.

680
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:26,051
刺杀哈桑的行动已万事俱备
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

681
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,071
巴扎耶夫及其手下正在处理一切

682
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:31,050
你只能和我单线联系

683
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,062
就此打住
We're done here.

684
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:38,002
哈桑死之前不许再联系我
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.

685
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:48,085
老实和你说
To be honest with you,

686
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:52,026
蕾妮·沃克不只是我的普通朋友
Renee Walker was more than just my friend.

687
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,016
你应该已经知道了  不是吗
But you already know that, don't you?

688
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,086
你看到我们在我公寓的卧室里
Because you saw us in the bedroom of my apartment.

689
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:03,003
这么说  要么是你狙击手的枪法太烂
Now, you're either not very good at what you do...

690
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:07,013
要么就是你想让她生不如死
or you wanted her to suffer.

691
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,091
因为以这把枪的射程
Because with that rifle from that range,

692
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:11,054
轻而易举就能一枪毙命
it was an easy kill shot.

693
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,094
但你却
But instead,

694
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,071
把枪眼对准她...
you shot her...

695
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:16,021
就是这里
right there...

696
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:18,044
心脏以下两英寸
two inches below her heart,

697
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,058
让她慢慢放血
so she would bleed out slowly.

698
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:22,001
我看着她
I watched her

699
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:24,012
因为血液慢慢填满肺部
gasping for air...

700
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:26,092
而艰难呼吸
as the blood slowly filled her lungs.

701
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,027
在痛苦中死去
She died in agony,

702
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,002
除非你告诉我  我想知道的
which is exactly what I'm gonna make you do

703
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,093
否则我也让你尝尝这滋味
unless you tell me what I want to know.

704
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,041
快说
Start talking to me!

705
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,014
你想知道  是不是我杀了你女朋友
You want to know I killed your girlfriend?

706
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:57,032
是我杀的她
I killed her.

707
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:58,098
是我杀了你那婊子
I kill your bitch!

708
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:08,040
求你  求你  你得让他住手  求你
Please... please, you've got to stop him. Please.

709
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,070
你要得到答案  他会给他的
He needs answers, and he's gonna get 'em.

710
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,030
我能用这向大众证明  这足够了
I can use this. There's enough here.

711
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,015
我不需要更多了
I don't need any more.

712
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:15,015
告诉他  我不需要更多了  求你了
Tell him I don't need any more. Please.

713
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,088
你哪儿也不能去
You're not going anywhere.

714
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,060
请让开  让开  让开
Move aside. Move. Move.

715
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:47,097
请离开尸体
Please step back from the bodies.

716
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:50,044
我宣布这里是反恐小组罪案现场
This is now a CTU crime scene.

717
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:53,048
我要所有从这些人身上搜到的武器和文件
I need all weapons and documents you found on these people.

718
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,060
长官  这是所有我们找到的
This is all we got, sir.

719
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,051
但所有人身上都没有身份证明
None of them had I.D.s on them.

720
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:05,042
这就是我们在找的人
This is the man we're looking for.

721
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,018
他名叫杰克·鲍尔
His name is Jack Bauer.

722
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,051
现在  你们分头去找他
Now, you need to spread out

723
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:10,047
检查每层楼面和每个出口
and check every floor and every exit.

724
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:13,097
他手上有人质  所以不会走远
He has a hostage with him, so he won't have gotten far.

725
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,010
鲍尔携带武器  是个非常危险的人物
Bauer's armed and extremely dangerous,

726
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:17,097
如果你们不想下场和这些人一样
so if you don't want to end up like these people,

727
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,080
见到他格杀勿论
shoot on sight.

728
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,086
我们走
Let's go.

729
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,082
听好了
Hey.

730
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:39,025
你醒了  我们接着玩如何
So, why don't we start this again.

731
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:43,035
我已知道是你杀了蕾妮·沃克
I already know that you killed Renee Walker.

732
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,056
我现在要知道的是...
What I want to know...

733
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,089
俄罗斯政府里面
is the name...

734
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:49,053
那头下命令的
of the Russian pig

735
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:52,012
俄国猪的
inside your government

736
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,098
名字
...that gave the order.

737
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:59,027
告诉我名字  我会给你个痛快
Give me a name, and I'll end this quickly.

738
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,040
我说话算话
I give you my word.

739
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:20,012
你觉得你了解痛苦是吗
You think you know about pain?

740
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:22,067
现在才刚开始
You don't know anything yet.

741
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,052
告诉我你们政府里
Give me the name of the person

742
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,072
想要蕾妮·沃克死的
inside your government

743
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:31,030
那个人的名字
