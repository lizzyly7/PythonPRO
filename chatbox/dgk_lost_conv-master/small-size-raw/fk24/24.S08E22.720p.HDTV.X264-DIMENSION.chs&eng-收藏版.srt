《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,065
我是梅瑞狄斯·里德
This is Meredith Reed.

5
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,032
里德小姐  
Ms. Reed,

6
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:18,080
那些你认为该对哈桑总统的死负责的人
the people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,056
他们不是单打独斗
were not working alone.

8
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,027
他们得到俄当局内部人士的资助
They were being funded and managed by people working

9
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,004
并受他们操纵
inside the Russian government.

10
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:25,019
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,044
我被人陷害了  就像你昨天一样
I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,017
我得把这证据交给你
I need to get this evidence to you.

13
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,022
阿洛从国安局梯队情报系统获得了一份监听报告
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off NSA's Echelon.

14
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:34,041
关键词是"杰克·鲍尔"
Key words: "Jack Bauer."

15
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:36,004
我们确定了声纹
We confirmed the voiceprint.

16
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:37,014
以里德与哈桑的关系
Reed's connection to Hassan means

17
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,040
她打心眼里愿意帮助杰克
she'd be highly motivated to help him.

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,010
他下一步棋就是把证据送媒体曝光
Take it to the press. That's his next move.

19
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:44,087
这是一个扫除一切障碍的大好时机  长官
This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir.

20
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,070
鲍尔和证据
Bauer and the evidence.

21
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,010
我得找到杰克
I need to find Jack...

22
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,094
不然他们会杀了他
or else they're gonna kill him.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,024
如果我们能找到他
If we can get to him,

24
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,011
我们就能揭穿这个掩盖真相的阴谋
we can expose the cover-up.

25
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,014
-杰克一定有个帮手  -谁
- Jack's gotta be working with someone.  - Who?

26
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,046
我不知道  我没见过他
I don't know. I never saw 'em,

27
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:59,034
但从杰克配备有最尖端的武器和通讯系统判断
but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms.

28
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,085
帕维尔  发现鲍尔了吗
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

29
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:02,018
有机会就开枪
If you have a shot, take it.

30
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,080
我看见他了
I've got him.

31
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,072
把枪放下
Put it down.

32
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:08,078
上面都处理好了  杰克
Everything's all clear up on top, Jack.

33
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:11,028
跟我走  照我说的做
Come with me. Do exactly what I say.

34
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,078
走
Move!

35
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:18,018
他早知道这是个陷阱
He knew it was a trap.

36
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:20,038
证据在这张记忆卡里
The evidence is on this memory card.

37
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,048
拿着
Take it.

38
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,065
你一看到视频就知道一切是真的
When you see it, you'll know it's real.

39
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:25,018
刺杀哈桑的行动已万事俱备
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

40
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,082
巴扎耶夫及其手下正在处理一切
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.

41
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,002
我已知道是你杀了蕾妮·沃克
I already know that you killed Renee Walker.

42
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,072
我现在要知道的是俄罗斯政府里面
What I want to know is the name of the Russian pig

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,079
那头下命令的俄国猪的名字
inside your government that gave the order.

44
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,072
你的手机SIM卡在哪里
Where's the SIM card for your phone?

45
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,036
你这蠢货  你吞了下去
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.

46
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:45,043
这一下是为了我的朋友
This is for my friend.

史无前例和平盛事的重要一员
unprecedented and historic peace initiative,

57
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:14,011
国务卿卡宁出于健康原因
Secretary of State Kanin's untimely decision

58
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:18,061
不得不放弃参加协议签署
to withdrew for health reasons was a difficult one.

59
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,097
然而  总统希望大家知道
However, the president wishes it to be known

60
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:26,033
鉴于国务卿卡宁已离开以及罗根的毛遂自荐
that in Secretary Kanin's absence and per his own recommendation,

61
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:30,071
已由前总统查尔斯·罗根担任总统顾问
she has sought and gained the counsel of former President Charles Logan.

62
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:35,016
此时  总统很清楚
Now, the president is acutely aware

63
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,038
此项决定会引起一些争议
that this decision bears some controversy.

64
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:42,044
但罗根总统在外交政策方面的经验
But President Logan's experience with foreign policy

65
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:46,018
以及谈判的技巧已被证明是在与伊斯兰共和国
and his skills in negotiation have already proven to be a great asset

66
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:49,025
签署和平协议之前的最后几个小时内
in these final hours before the signing of the peace agreement

67
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:50,098
难能可贵的财富
with the Islamic Republic.

68
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,005
一旦哈桑夫人
Once Mrs. Hassan...

69
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,029
打搅了  总统阁下
Excuse me, Mr. President.

70
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,062
与伊斯兰共和国代表团
...and the IRK delegation...

71
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,084
去直升机场的车已经为您准备好了  就在楼下
Your car to the heliport is ready and waiting downstairs.

72
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,067
萨瓦洛夫总统的飞机到了没
Has, uh, President Suvarov's plane arrived yet?

73
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:03,065
应该再有二三十分钟就到肯尼迪机场了
It should be touching down at JFK within the next 20 to 30 minutes,

74
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:06,051
然后会有直升机送他去93号大道直升机场
and then he'll be choppered in to the 93rd Street Heliport.

75
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,068
谢谢你  艾伦
Thank you, Ellen.

76
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,044
通知他们我马上下去
Tell them I'll be down in a moment.

77
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:09,041
是  阁下
Yes, sir.

78
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,037
一旦哈桑夫人及伊斯兰共和国代表团
Once Mrs. Hassan and the IRK delegation

79
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:17,059
与泰勒总统解决了协议剩余的几个问题
have hashed out a few remaining points of protocol with President Taylor...

80
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:21,044
签署工作将如期进行
...the signing will commence as scheduled.

81
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,010
告诉我你们有鲍尔的线索了
Tell me you have a lead on Bauer.

82
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,089
抱歉  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

83
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,066
我们跟踪他到一栋邻近的大楼
We tracked him to an adjacent building,

84
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,070
但鲍尔还是设法逃出了包围圈
but Bauer managed to get out of the cordon,

85
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,053
还带走了记者梅瑞狄斯·里德
along with the reporter Meredith Reed.

86
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,070
他还杀了帕维尔
Also, he's killed Pavel.

87
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:44,003
我已从纽约警局那接过现场的管辖权
I've taken jurisdictional control over the scene from NYPD.

88
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,094
我们应该能够控制住局面  但是...
We should be able to keep this contained, but it...

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,036
如果鲍尔已将丹娜·沃什的证据交给媒体
it's not gonna matter if Bauer's already passed along the evidence

90
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,081
再怎么控制也没有意义了
he got from Dana Walsh to the press.

91
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,031
事情就要败露了
The story's going to come out.

92
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:55,078
不  不一定
No, not necessarily.

93
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:58,034
我们还是可以控制住的
We still might be able to manage this.

94
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,081
长官  我知道您说过
Look, sir, I- I know you've told me

95
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,038
承诺要把事情摆平
that you're committed to seeing this through,

96
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:03,058
但您现在还有机会抽身保持清白
but you can still extricate yourself from this mess.

97
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,048
还没有证据牵扯到您
There's no evidence of your involvement yet.

98
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:07,025
您还可以推迟新闻发布会
You can still delay the press announcement.

99
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,075
来不及了  杰森
It's too late for that, Jason.

100
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,062
白宫新闻发言人刚刚宣布了
The White House Press Secretary just announced

101
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:12,042
我在和平进程中的地位
my role in the peace process.

102
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,002
已无路可退了
There is no turning back.

103
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,075
还有件事该让您知道
And there's something else you should know.

104
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:18,066
鲍尔不仅仅是杀了帕维尔
Bauer didn't just kill Pavel.

105
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:20,039
而且是以开膛破肚的方式杀
He butchered him.

106
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:23,059
他对他一顿痛扁  还挖了他的内脏
He beat him savagely, and then he eviscerated him.

107
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,010
我认为鲍尔不仅仅是想
I don't think Bauer's just looking

108
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,043
曝光俄罗斯政府杀害哈桑的阴谋
to expose the Russians' involvement in the plot against Hassan.

109
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,043
这家伙是来报仇雪恨的
This guy's out for blood.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,097
那你最好找到并阻止他  明白吗
Then you'd better find him and stop him, hadn't you?

111
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,054
是  长官
Yes, sir.

112
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,044
随时向我汇报
Keep me posted.

113
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,082
你要是不告诉我刚才在那发生什么了
I'm not going any further till you tell me

114
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,085
我就不走了
what happened back there.

115
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:50,032
你杀了那个人  对不对
You killed that man, didn't you?

116
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,075
里德女士  你现在有生命危险
Ms. Reed, your life is in danger.

117
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,048
你要是想活着度过难关
You want to get through this thing alive,

118
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:55,042
你就得严格照我说的做
you're gonna do exactly what I say.

119
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,085
明白吗
Do you understand?

120
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,098
杰克  我无法对你刚刚
Jack, I can't get a locate

121
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,079
用这个手机拨的号码进行定位
on the number you called from this phone.

122
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,003
被限制了
It's restricted.

123
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,026
我打算再逆向追踪一次
I'm gonna have to route a back trace.

124
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,033
你在这能做吗
Can you do it here?

125
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,093
不能  我需要我那里的设备
No. I need the equipment at my place.

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,036
你找出方位后马上给我电话
Get back to me as soon as you got a location.

127
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,050
-好的  -咱们走
- All right.  - Let's go.

128
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,090
你在找谁
Who is it you're looking for?

129
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,030
一个能告诉我所有涉案人员名单的人
Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved.

130
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,081
等你找到他们你会怎么做
And what are you gonna do when you find them?

131
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,028
这与你无关
It doesn't concern you.

132
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:18,054
如果你不告诉我你在干嘛我怎么能相信你
How can I trust you if you don't tell me what you're doing?

133
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,061
因为想杀你的人不是我
Because I'm not the person who's trying to kill you.

134
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,001
我给你的那个视频文件
The video file that I gave you

135
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:26,040
是俄罗斯人合谋刺杀哈桑总统的唯一证据
is the only proof of the Russians' complicity president Hassan's assassination.

136
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,095
但这场阴谋并不仅仅牵扯到俄罗斯人
But the conspiracy doesn't end with the Russians.

137
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,006
我们政府内部有人
There are people within our own government

138
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:33,002
包括泰勒总统在内  正试图掩盖真相
that are trying cover this up, including President Taylor.

139
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,076
总统为什么要掩盖真相
Why would the president want this covered up?

140
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,083
因为她想继续与伊斯兰共和国签署和平协议
Because she's trying to keep the peace accord alive with the IRK.

141
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,047
她清楚如果让达莉亚·哈桑发觉
And she knows if Dalia Hassan finds out

142
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,040
俄罗斯人跟她丈夫的死脱不了干系
that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband,

143
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,075
她将决不会签署协议
she'll never sign the agreement.

144
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,069
你想要我怎么样
What do you want from me?

145
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:49,056
如果我死了  我要你把事实公之于众
I need you to break the story in case I don't make it.

146
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:53,009
该还哈桑总统一个事实真相  你觉得呢
I think Presidt Hassan deserves that, don't you?

147
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,060
把你手机给我
Let me see your cell phone.

148
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,083
好
Okay.

149
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,093
等等  你干什么
Wait. What are you doing? I..

150
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,023
他们见过你和我在一起
They've seen you with me.

151
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,093
当局会开始监控
The authorities are going to start monitoring

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,047
你常用的通讯方式
your usual forms of communicaon.

153
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:09,004
你不能回家  不能回办公室
You can't go home, you can't go back to your office.

154
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:11,047
你有可以信任的同事吗
Is there anyone that you work with that you trust?

155
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,048
我的编辑盖里·克劳斯纳
Uh, my editor Gary Klausner.

156
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,015
你得试试把证据给他
You need to try and get him the evidence.

157
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,063
我就只能把你带到公用电话那里了
I can get you as far as a pay phone.

158
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,059
以后的事  你就只能靠自己了
After that, you're on your own.

159
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:22,005
很高兴我们能达成协议
I'm glad we were able to come to terms.

160
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,049

总统阁下  感谢您的耐心  
Thank you, Madam President, for your patience with me.

162
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,009
对谈判  我还是新手
I am still new to this.

163
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,033
您天生就是当领袖的料  达莉亚
You are a natural leader, Dalia,

164
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,070
而且您有位很棒的顾问  贾莫特部长

165
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:34,040
感谢您的认可  总统阁下
I appreciate the endorsement, Madam President.

166
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,063
请原谅
Pardon me...

167
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,003
我的打扰
for interrupting.

168
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,060
我们刚刚结束
We were just finishing up.

169
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,097
达莉亚·哈桑
Dalia Hassan.

170
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,091
查尔斯·罗根

171
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,010
很荣幸终于见到了您  哈桑夫人

172
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,006
我很崇敬您的丈夫
I was a great admirer of your husband.

173
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,001
请节哀
I'm so sorry for you loss.

174
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,018
谢谢您
Thank you.

175
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,055
泰勒总统告诉我
President Taylor tells me

176
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,069
您对于说服俄罗斯代表回到谈判桌前
you were instrumental in convincing the Russian delegates

177
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,042
有很大帮助
to stay at the negotiating table.

178
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,097
值此历史性的一刻  
I'm honored to play even a small part

179
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:58,045
我为能尽微薄之力倍感荣幸
in such an historic event.

180
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:04,039
总统阁下  我能跟您谈谈吗
Madam President, may I have a few moments with you?

181
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,059
签署仪式上见
I'll see you at the signing.

182
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
你还没查清
You still haven't found out

183
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,015
罗根如何说服俄罗斯人继续谈判的
how Logan convinced the Russians to stay?

184
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,010
我调查过
I've investigated it,

185
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,051
可在代表团那边我一无所获
but I learned nothing from the delegates.

186
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:22,007
我可以让我们的情报部门调查一下
I can have our intelligence service look into it.

187
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:23,030
不用了  谢谢你  贾莫特
No. Thank you, Jamot.

188
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,024
我相信泰勒总统
I trust President Taylor.

189
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,010
我们必须相信她让罗根参与
We have to assume that if she involved Logan,

190
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,061
必定是有强有力的理由
it was for a good reason.

191
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,075
逮捕杰克·鲍尔的行动失败了
The operation to capture Jack Bauer was unsuccessful.

192
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:44,092
他带着从丹娜·沃什手上拿到的证据逃脱了
He got away, along with the evidence that he took from Dana Walsh.

193
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:46,099
你说过你已经控制了形势
You said you had the situation under control.

194
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:50,073
显然我是过于乐观了
Clearly, I was overly optimistic.

195
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,082
也是由于我的乐观
And in my optimism,

196
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:54,005
我忘了告诉您
I neglected to tell you

197
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,087
鲍尔跟一位记者
that Bauer made contact with a journalist.

198
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:58,010
梅瑞狄斯·里德取得了联络
Meredith Reed.

199
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,001
天哪
My God...

200
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,051
您必须马上给她的出版商打电话
You need to call her publisher right away.

201
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:05,014
宣布您对她所提供的任何证据事先都不知情
Deny any foreknowledge of whatever evidence she has,

202
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,071
并要求他们不要报道
and demand that they do not run the story.

203
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,008
你在建议我封住媒体的嘴吗
You're suggesting muzzling the press?

204
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:13,057
你忘了报道自由受到宪法保护吗
Have you forgotten that freedom of the press is Constitutionally protected?

205
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:15,095
我的天啊  您可是总统啊
You are the president, for God's sake.

206
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,049
您就说事关国家安全
Invoke national security.

207
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:20,019
告诉他们此事会成为战争的导火索
You tell them this story will start a war.

208
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,050
会让无辜者性命难保
Innocent lives will be lost.

209
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,034
谎言复谎言  谎言何其多
New lies to cover the old ones.

210
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,039
总统阁下  现在已经不是悲天悯人的时候了
The time has passed for hand wringing, Madam President.

211
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,026
如果您不动用白宫的力量
If you don't use the power of your office

212
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,026
阻止此事见报
to shut this story down,

213
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:34,010
损失的将不止是您的和平进程
your peace agreement won't be the only casualty.

214
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,062
不用我来告诉您
You don't need me to tell you the damage

215
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:40,001
对您诉诸刑事诉讼
that your criminal prosecution

216
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:42,024
将对这个国家产生的不良影响吧
will do to this country.

217
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,038
你在任时犯法  这个国家都挺过来了
This country survived your presidency.

218
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:47,011
但您在任期间就不一定了
But it won't survive yours.

219
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,075
我的总统之职是继任而来
Me- I inherited my presidency.

220
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:54,032
我从未像您这么受公众欢迎
I was never nearly as popular as you are.

221
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,012
而且大多数我所谓的罪行都没见报
And most of my alleged misdeeds never made the press.

222
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,019
可如果您将自己的罪过
But if you were to bare your sins

223
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,056
透露给将您推上总统宝座的人民...
to the people who put you in office...?

224
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:09,063
您是正义的导航明灯
You are a beacon of righteousness,

225
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,024
不止在美国人心中  也在全球民众心中
not only for Americans, but for the rest of the world.

226
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:18,012
您是位宁可让亲生女儿被捕
You are the president who had her own daughter arrested

227
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:21,018
都不愿让正义蒙羞的总统
rather than see justice go unserved.

228
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,025
你真是条蛊惑人心的毒蛇
You're a poison.

229
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:27,082
我真不该让你插手
I never should have let you do this.

230
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,066
恕我直言  总统阁下
With due respect, Madam President,

231
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,072
我是给过些建议
I- I gave recommendations,

232
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,043
我是做了些需要的安排
I made whatever arrangements needed to be made.

233
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,043
但一切决定都是您作出的
But every decision was yours.

234
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,003
咱们没法自欺欺人
Let's not pretend otherwise.

235
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,057
我研究您这个人
I've-I've studied you

236
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,091
好几年了  艾莉森
for a number of years, Allison.

237
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:54,088
我自负很会看人
I pride myself on being a good judge of character.

238
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,088
您是个聪明的女人
You're a smart woman.

239
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,050
您总知道需要做什么
You've always known what needed to be done

240
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,045
并且会下定决心去做
and were willing to do it.

241
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,025
所以我知道
Which is why I know

242
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,034
您会打给梅瑞狄斯·里德的出版商
you will call Meredith Reed's publisher

243
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,072
确保他不让那事见报
and make sure he kills the story.

244
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,012
我建议您现在就打
I would suggest you do it now.

245
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,052
您...
You, uh...

246
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:15,019
您有个签署仪式要准备
You have a signing ceremony to prepare for.

247
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:20,060
我得去见萨瓦洛夫总统了
And I need to go meet President Suvarov.

248
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,055
面部识别处理已启动
Facial Recognition Process Initiated

249
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,017
克罗伊
Chloe,

250
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,021
你得看看这个
you need to see this.

251
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:42,051
我刚接入了皮勒小队的现场视频
I just tapped into a live feed from Pillar's team.

252
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,024
发现这个人在百货公司对面
This guy was found strung up

253
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:47,044
一幢废弃的大楼里被吊起来并被开膛破肚
and sliced open in an abandoned building across from the department store.

254
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,095
他身上有俄罗斯证件
He's got Russian papers on him,

255
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,042
但我看不清  分辨率太低了
but I can't make 'em out; the rez is too low.

256
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:54,096
好像现场有人留了杆狙击枪
Looks like someone left a sniper rifle at the scene.

257
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,079
是什么口径的  调出来看看
What's the caliber? Bring it up.

258
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:59,096
上面标着是春田军工厂造  点308口径  
They tagged it as a.308 Springfield.

259
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,086
那把就是杀死蕾妮的枪
That's the gun that killed Renee.

260
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,026
肯定就是那个狙击手
That's got to be the shooter.

261
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:08,007
是杰克干的  你还觉得能通过谈话阻止他吗
Jack did this, you're gonna be able to talk him down?

262
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:09,094
我必须一试
I gotta try.

263
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,027
皮勒和他的手下只想杀掉他
Pillar and his people are just gonna kill him,

264
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,067
我不能坐视不管
and I can't let that happen.

265
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,088
与百货公司获得的监控画面  82%匹配
Got a match from the department store security feed- 82%.

266
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:21,014
那就是杰克的帮手
That's the guy helping Jack?

267
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,067
对  詹姆斯·理查尔 前美军特种部队队员
Yeah, James Ricker- Ex-Green Beret, Special Ops.

268
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,001
他在杰克被召入反恐小组前
He served with Jack in the Gulf

269
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,068
曾在海湾战争时期与他一起服役
before Jack was enlisted by CTU.

270
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,095
只有一个问题
Just one problem.

271
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:29,002
上面说他死了
He's dead.

272
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:32,059
七年前  在巴士拉一次化工厂爆炸中身亡
It says he was killed in a chemical plant explosion in Basra seven years ago.

273
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,027
没错  那他肯定有个双胞胎兄弟
Yeah, well, then he must have a twin who was there

274
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,092
在杰克打反埋伏战时在场
when Jack reversed the ambush.

275
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,073
你最好回到自己的工作站去
You better go back to your station.

276
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:45,009
皮勒的眼线要起疑心了
Pillar's watchdog is getting suspicious.

277
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,047
阿洛
Arlo,

278
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:49,087
在车管所数据库里交叉比对理查尔的照片
cross-reference Ricker's photo with State DMV database.

279
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,087
他在城里生活肯定用了化名
He must be living under an alias in the city.

280
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,030
只要找到了理查尔  就能找到杰克
We find Ricker, we find Jack.

281
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,009
好
Okay.

282
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:02,012
喂
Yeah?

283
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,075
弄清他在哪了吗
You get the location?

284
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:06,064
你可没告诉我追踪的是罗根的电话   杰克
You didn't tell me that was Logan's phone that I was tracing, Jack.

285
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:07,052
有关系吗
Does it matter?

286
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,035
当然了
Yeah, it kind of does.

287
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,092
我认为你也清楚
I think you know it, too,

288
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,056
要不然你早就告诉我实话了
or else you would've been straight with me.

289
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:16,019
听着  解决一群俄罗斯间谍是一回事
Listen, taking out a bunch of Russian spooks is one thing,

290
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,026
但要动前总统  又是另外一回事了
moving on an ex-president, that's quite another.

291
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,059
你这是在玩火  哥们
That's a serious line you're crossing there, pal.

292
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,043
我很清楚我在干什么
I know exactly what I'm doing.

293
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:23,090
你到底告不告诉我他在哪
Are you gonna give me the location or not?

294
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,097
罗根在车上
Logan's in a vehicle.

295
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:29,093
他从联合国总部出来正向西行驶
He's moving west from the U.N.

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,089
我正在同步特勤局的部署网络
I'm syncing up with the Secret Service deployment grid.

297
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,077
我会把他的路线传到你的平板电脑上
I'll upload his route to your tablet.

298
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,062
稍等
Hold on.

299
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:40,013
正接收特勤局部署网之车辆路线文件
Receiving Datafile Secret Service Grid Map Vehicle Route

300
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,028
好了  我收到了
Okay, I've got it.

301
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,088
杰克  真希望你知道自己在干什么
Listen, Jack, I sure hope you know what you're doing,

302
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:47,008
因为你走上的是一条不归路
because this path you're on, there ain't no coming back from it.

303
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,062
我就没想过有退路
I wasn't planning on coming back.

304
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,099
你是对的  你为我所做的已经够多了
Look, you're right, you've already done more than I had right to ask for.

305
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,025
我要你现在开始清除和我一切的瓜葛
I want you to start erasing all your connections to me.

306
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:59,016
吉姆  感谢你为我所做的一切  再见
Jim... thanks for everything. Good-bye.

307
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,000
谢谢
Thank you.

308
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,060
这些就够了吗  我是否该去叫医生
Are you sure that's all you need? Should I call the doctor?

309
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,056
只是头疼而已
It's just a headache.

310
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:48,090
我没事  谢谢
I'm fine. Thank you.

311
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:50,045
-您找我吗  总统阁下  -是的  蒂姆
- You wanted to see me, Madame President? - Yes, Tim.

312
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,054
请坐
Please sit down.

313
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,071
还记得反恐组昨晚逮捕的那个记者吗
You remember the reporter CTU arrested last night?

314
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,035
记得  梅瑞狄斯·里德
Yes, uh, Meredith Reed.

315
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,048
据我所知
It has been brought to my attention

316
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,055
她打算发表一则关于奥马·哈桑之死的
that she intends to publish an unfounded story

317
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,072
毫无事实根据的报道
regarding Omar Hassan's murder.

318
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,066
她要写什么
What is she gonna be writing?

319
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,026
我需要你与联邦调查局取得联系
I need you to contact the FBI,

320
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:20,020
叫他们搜查星期日杂志社办公室
have them search the Sunday Magazine offices,

321
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:24,093
并截获她声称拥有的任何证据
and seize whatever evidence she purports to have.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,080
我不是很明白
Um, I-I... I don't understand.

323
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,085
她宣称的一切都是假象
Her allegations are false,

324
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:31,097
但光这谣言就能破坏和谈进程
but the allegations alone could derail the peace process.

325
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:33,066
即便如此  总统阁下  您得清楚
Well, even so, Madam President, you have to be aware,

326
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,054
他们会控告您审查媒体
they'll accuse you of censoring the press.

327
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,072
蒂姆  我叫你来不是给我忠告的
Tim, I did not ask for your counsel.

328
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,093
我给你下的命令  我非常清楚
I know exactly what I'm ordering you to do,

329
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:42,074
你只管执行就是了
so please just do it.

330
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,041
遵命  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,062
下客接待处怎么走
Hey, drop-off and receiving?

332
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,018
往前走
Uh, yeah, straight ahead.

333
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,009
-就在那边  -谢谢
- Right there. - Thanks.

334
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,092
告诉道根让他来报道罗根的人物概评
Just make sure Duggan knows he's covering the Logan profile.

335
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:48,046
告诉他  我们会决定最后的署名
Tell him we'll work out the byline later.

336
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,027
主编办公室  我是克劳斯纳
Editor's desk. This is Klausner.

337
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:53,070
盖里  是我
Gary, it's me.

338
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,090
旁边有人吗
Look, a-are you alone?

339
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,013
说话方便吗
Can you speak freely?

340
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,090
方便
Yeah.

341
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,054
怎么了
Yeah, wh-what's going on?

342
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,014
我时间不多  我有一则报道的线索
I don't have a lot of time; I have a lead on a story.

343
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,044
-愿闻其详  -我有一份视频文件
- I'm listening. - I have a digital video recording

344
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:07,024
表明杀害哈桑总统的伊斯兰共和国恐怖份子
indicating that the IRK terrorists who killed Hassan

345
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,084
幕后的资助者和操纵者是俄罗斯间谍
were being funded and run by Russian operatives.

346
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,088
你确定是合法的吗
Uh, y-you sure it's legit?

347
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,045
你从哪弄来的
Where did you get it?

348
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,022
杰克·鲍尔那
From Jack Bauer.

349
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:17,045
鲍尔
Bauer?!

350
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,072
他是个逃犯
The man's a fugitive.

351
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:21,005
听着  盖里  现在说话真的很不安全
Look, Gary, it's really not safe for me to talk.

352
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,056
见面再说吧
I'll explain more when I see you.

353
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,062
你能和我见一面吗
Can you meet me?

354
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,092
当然可以
Sure, of course.

355
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:28,003
好  去那家咖啡让你反胃的餐馆
All right, that diner with the coffee you hate.

356
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,073
十五分钟内到
I can be there in, uh, 15 minutes.

357
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,016
好的  盖里  别告诉任何人
Okay. And, Gary, don't tell anyone.

358
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:34,016
好吗
All right?

359
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:35,023
我明白
I got it.

360
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,040
梅瑞狄斯  多加小心
Meredith... be safe.

361
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,057
嗯  你也要小心
Yeah. You, too.

362
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:08,036
完全没必要恐慌
There's no need to panic.

363
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,086
你知道他都对帕维尔干了什么吗
Do you know what he did to Pavel?

364
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,060
他遭受了毒打  然后像猪一样被开膛破肚
He was beaten savagely, gutted like a pig.

365
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,010
他手下全被枪杀了
His men shot dead.

366
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,000
我很遗憾
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that,

367
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,057
但你我彼此心知肚明...
but we both knew that, uh...

368
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:22,007
鲍尔不是一盏省油的灯
Bauer would be a difficult problem to solve.

369
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,056
你清楚他在干什么  对吧
You know what he's doing, don't you?

370
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:25,044
他在除掉任何与事件有牵连的人
He's eliminating everyone involved,

371
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,031
照他这样一路杀过来  找上我是迟早的事
working his way up- how long before he gets to me?

372
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:28,057
那不太可能
That's not going to happen.

373
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,010
你怎么就那么肯定
How can you be so sure?

374
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:32,028
因为是你自己对我说的
Because you told me yourself

375
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,035
你的手下嘴很严
your man would never talk,

376
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,022
如果是真的
and if that's true, then...

377
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,015
那么在你的核心集团之外就没人能指控你了
nobody outside of your inner circle can point the finger at you.

378
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:41,049
我向你保证
I promise you...

379
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,091
鲍尔是绝对不会知道的
Bauer's never going to know.

380
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,043
好消息是  鉴于他最近的行为
And on the upside, his recent activities

381
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,053
已给我们带来了一些好处
have given us a bit of an advantage.

382
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:52,076
什么好处
What advantage?

383
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:56,047
反恐组奉命已将处置他的方式升级为
CTU orders concerning him have been upgraded

384
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,023
"格杀勿论"
to "Shoot on sight."

385
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:00,080
但首先你得找到他
First you have to find him.

386
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:02,087
他们会找到他的  别担心
They're going to find him; don't worry.

387
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,071
他是不可能一直销声匿迹的
He can't... he can't stay under the radar forever.

388
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,008
有情况我会通知你
I'll keep you posted.

389
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:37,080
我们遭到袭击
We're under assault!

390
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,008
我们被困在了第四街的地下车道里
We are trapped in the 4th Street underpass.

391
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:45,055
我是L-1小组  请求立即支援

392
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:48,009
两边的入口都堵住了  我们被围困了
Both entrances are blocked. We are boxed in.

393
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,096
那是杰克·鲍尔
Oh, that's... that's Jack Bauer.

394
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:51,046
一定是他
That's got to be.

395
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,086
没听到我说的吗
Did you hear what I said?!

396
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:55,042
那是杰克·鲍尔
That's Jack Bauer!

397
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,096
别干坐在那啊
Don't just sit there!

398
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,056
他是冲我来的
He's coming for me!

399
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,062
长官  待在车里
Sir, stay in the vehicle.

400
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:05,072
这是防弹车  玻璃也是防弹的
We're armored and the glass is bulletproof.

401
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,030
袭击我们的人戴着面具
The assailant is masked.

402
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,090
可能是杰克·鲍尔
It may be Jack Bauer.

403
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,025
-关门  保护车的安全  -关门
- Close the door! Secure the vehicle! - Close the door!

404
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:42,037
卧倒  总统阁下
Stay down, Mr. President!

405
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,046
杀了他
Kill him!

406
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:54,011
总统阁下  给我起来  否则我就地宰了你
Mr. President, get up, or I will kill you right here.

407
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,081
快走

对理查尔的调查有什么发现吗
What'd you find out about Ricker?

410
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:24,037

车管所记录显示理查尔住在萨福克郡
DMV records show Ricker living in Suffolk County

444
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:27,012
记住  只要不对罗根总统构成直接威胁
Remember, unless it poses an immediate threat to President Logan,

445
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:28,087
你们一见到杰克就开枪击毙他
you shoot Bauer on sight, and you shoot to kill.

446
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,047
我们走
Let's go.

447
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,077
看着我
Look at me.

448
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:45,090
我叫你看着我
I said look at me!

449
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:47,056
我问你的你都得老实交代
You're going to tell me everything I want to know.

450
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,025
杰克  你误会了
Jack, you're making a mistake.

451
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:51,031
别给我装蒜说你跟这事没半点关系
Don't you even try and pretend you're not a part of this.

452
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,061
我找到了杀死蕾妮·沃克的人
I found the man who killed Renee Walker:

453
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:56,001
那个俄罗斯间谍  帕维尔·托卡列夫
the Russian operative Pavel Tokarev.

454
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,030
他接的最后一个电话就是你打的
The last call he got was from you.

455
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,098
我知道你一定认为是我  但你得听我解释
I know how it looks. You got to let me explain.

456
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,035
还解释什么
Explain what?

457
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:03,035
就是你派他来杀我的吗
That you sent for him to kill me?

458
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,009
是你派他来杀我的  对吧
You sent him to kill me, right?

459
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,038
对  见鬼  是我
Yes! Damn it, yes!

460
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:07,099
那你为什么还要杀蕾妮·沃克
Why did you take out a hit on Renee Walker?

461
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,023
那事跟我没关系
I had nothing to do with that.

462
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,079
那事之后我才卷进来的
I was brought in after that happened.

463
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,006
是谁拉你入伙的
Who brought you in?

464
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,060
泰勒总统要我帮她
President Taylor needed my help

465
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,091
说服俄罗斯人回到谈判桌前
to bring the Russians back to the table.

466
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,048
我打电话给我莫斯科的线人
I- I called my sources in Moscow.

467
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,026
他们告诉我他们政府里的人
They told me that people in their government

468
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,049
是暗杀哈桑的幕后主使
were behind Hassan's assassination.

469
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,092
我告诉俄罗斯代表团我有相关证据
I- I told the Russian delegation I had evidence of that fact

470
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,019
和所有涉案人员的名单
and the names of everybody involved.

471
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:26,056
我只是想让他们继续谈判罢了
It was just to keep them at the conference.

472
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,073
是什么证据
What evidence?!

473
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,090
根本没什么证据
It doesn't exist.

474
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,017
我赌上了一把
I was playing poker.

475
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,073
只是虚张声势  这招见效了
It was a bluff. It worked.

476
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,010
这让泰勒的和谈得以继续  但你...
It kept Taylor's peace agreement on the table, but you...

477
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,074
但你却决意要把这事搅黄了
You were determined to screw things up.

478
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,093
而且...
And to...

479
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:40,025
哎呦  息怒  杰克  别打了  我承认
Ow! Easy. Jack! Jack! Jack! I admit.

480
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,088
我承认  我参与了掩盖真相的阴谋
I admit, I was part of the cover-up,

481
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:43,051
但我并没有参与俄罗斯人的阴谋
but I'm not part of the Russian conspiracy.

482
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:47,025
恐怖袭击和你朋友的死都跟我都毫无关系
I had nothing to do with the terrorist attack or your friend's death.

483
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:50,018
我真不是干那种勾当的坏人
I- I... I'm... I'm not the bad guy here.

484
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,018
好啊  可你知道谁是
Okay, but you know who is.

485
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,052
你知道那个俄罗斯政府内部
You know the name of the person inside the Russian government

486
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,019
负责此事的人的名字  告诉我那个名字
who's giving the orders. I want that name.

487
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:57,069
-杰克  -快告诉我名字
- Jack...  - Give me the name!

488
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,030
-杰克  -在你脑袋开花之前
- Jack...  - You got five seconds

489
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,029
-你还有五秒钟时间考虑  -不 请别这样
- before I put a bullet through your head. - No! No! You don't have to do that.

490
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,049
-5...  -我说  我说
- Five...  - I'll tell you.

491
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:04,026
4  3...  是米哈伊尔·诺瓦科维奇
four... three... Mikhail Novakovich.

492
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,020
他是俄罗斯代表团的头
He's the head of the Russian delegation.

493
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:09,047
他从一开始就想让和平协议胎死腹中
He's been trying to kill the peace treaty from the start.

494
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
你在撒谎
You're lying.

495
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:13,087
不  不  我绝没撒谎  不要  不要啊
No! No! No! I'm not lying to you! No! No! No! No!

496
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,057
你不是从帕维尔的手机查到我的电话吗
You got my call from Pavel's phone.

497
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:16,091
你去查查之前的通话
You check the previous calls.

498
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:19,024
保准有一大堆诺瓦科维奇的电话
There's a dozen more from Novakovich.

499
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:21,004
听我的没错  他就是你要找的人
I'm telling you. He's the one you want.

500
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:22,008
闭嘴
Shut up!

501
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:25,004
再敢出声  我立马宰了你
Say another word, and I'll drop you right here.

502
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,046
上
Go!

503
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,032
跪下
Get on your knees.

504
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,053
别这样  求你了
Oh, no. Please.

505
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:41,079
不要杀我  杰克
Don't shoot me, Jack.

506
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,083
我要是想杀你  你早就挂了
If I was gonna kill you, you'd already be dead.

507
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,050
鲍尔刚才就在这里  找到他
Bauer was just here- find him!

508
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,004
总统阁下
Mr. President?

509
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:24,097
总统阁下  您没事吧  能听见我说话吗
Mr. President, are you okay? Can you hear me?

510
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:28,011
伊登  给我派个医疗小组到49号大街交叉口
Eden, I need a med unit at the 49th junction.

511
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,034
已经派出
On its way.

512
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,052
是抓到鲍尔了吗
Is it Bauer?

513
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:33,011
不  只发现了总统
No. It's the president.

514
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,048
他昏过去了
He's unconscious.

515
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,091
鲍尔跑了  我要你重新部署追捕
Bauer escaped. I'm gonna need you to redirect the pursuit.

516
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:38,018
我在这陪护总统
I'll stay with the president.

517
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,095
明白
Understood.

518
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,005
他们还是可能会抓到他
They still might catch up to him.

519
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:44,095
至少现在还没  有理查尔的档案了吗
They haven't yet. Do you have Ricker's file?

520
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,071
有  包括目前的住址
Yeah, including his current address.

521
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,033
我马上传你
I'm sending it to you now.

522
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,095
你准备怎么处理这事
How are you planning to handle this?

523
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:52,032
为了不让皮勒知道
We can't send any tactical units

524
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,029
我们又不能派任何战术小组去找他
to pick this guy up without Pillar finding out about it.

525
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,098
我不会用他们
I'm not using any of them.

526
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:57,072
那你打算派谁去
Then who are you going to get?

527
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,039
我们的所有探员都出任务了
All of our agents are fully deployed in the field.

528
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:01,029
无人可调遣了
There's nobody to send.

529
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,051
还有一个人
There's one.

530
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,011
奥布赖恩女士
Ms. O'Brian?

531
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,000
奥布赖恩女士
Ms. O'Brian?!

532
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,026
我刚看到总部的通知
I just saw the flash from division.

533
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:26,031
他们同意了你的请求
They approved your request

534
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:28,001
释放奥迪斯探员交你监管
to release Agent Ortiz into your custody?

535
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:29,054
对  我还有急事  失陪
Yeah, I'm in a hurry, so...

536
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:30,042
你知道你在干什么吗
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:33,022
他是名因拒不配合被联邦法院起诉的目击证人
He's a non-cooperative witness who is facing federal charges.

538
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,052
或许你没发现
In case you haven't noticed,

539
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,019
我仍负责联合国总部的安全
I'm still in charge of UN Security,

540
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,085
而你占用了我的所有可调配资源
and you've taken away all my resources.

541
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:39,000
而且这本来就不是你管的
And not that it's any of your business,

542
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,015
而是奥迪斯探员计划了整个联合国的安全事宜
but Agent Ortiz designed the entire UN operation.

543
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,066
还有不到两小时就要进行签署仪式了
The signing is in less than two hours.

544
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:45,062
他在外勤任务中的作用至关重要
His assistance in the field is vital.

545
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:48,005
我得让皮勒批准此事才行
I'm going to have to clear this with Pillar.

546
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:49,096
悉听尊便   但我看你还有更大的麻烦要处理
Do what you want, but to me, you have bigger problems,

547
00:27:49,096 --> 00:27:51,059
比如先去找到杰克·鲍尔
like not finding Jack Bauer.

548
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:17,043
你是梅瑞狄斯吗
Are you Meredith?

549
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:20,049
是的  
Yes.

550
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,089
有个叫盖里·克劳斯纳的打电话找你
There's a Gary Klausner on the phone for you.

551
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:24,023
-电话在收银台的边上  -谢谢
- It's up by the cashier. - Thank you.

552
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,027
谢谢
Thanks.

553
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,042
你在哪
Where are you?

554
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,042
梅瑞狄斯  联调局来人了
Meredith, the FBI is here.

555
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,079
我能离开之前他们就到了
Showed up before I could leave.

556
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,031
他们在找你  盘问包括我在内的所有人
They're looking for you,  questioning everyone, including me.

557
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:43,033
你什么都没说  对吗
You didn't tell them anything, did you?

558
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:44,040
当然没有了
Of course not.

559
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,091
但他们有总统签署的行政命令
But they've got an executive order from the president.

560
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,070
他们说你手上的东西
They say you're in possession of materials

561
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,064
对国家安全构成了威胁
that pose a national security risk.

562
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,037
这是在掩盖真相  盖里
It's a cover-up, Gary.

563
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,032
白宫想要禁止此事见报
The White House is trying to suppress the story.

564
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,051
你不能让他们得逞
You can't let them.

565
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:58,027
听着  在我们渡过这一关前
Look, until we clear this up,

566
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,064
你得保护好证据
you have to protect that evidence.

567
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,069
我告诉他们我已经跟你撇清关系了
I told them I haven't had any contact with you,

568
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:04,027
但据我所知  他们正在追踪这个电话
but for all I know, they're tracing this call.

569
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:05,039
你最好马上离开那里
You better get the hell out of there.

570
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:07,014
去哪里
And go where?

571
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:11,049
我们说过不要跟外界联系
We said no communication outside of our presence.

572
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,057
我只是在取消一个约会
I- I I'm canceling an appointment.

573
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,078
盖里  他们想掩盖真相
Gary, they're going to bury the truth.

574
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,011
有我在他们就休想
Not if I can help it.

575
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:19,096
我会设法和司法部的爱德·桑普森联系
I'll try to put a call into Ed Sampson  at the Justice Department,

576
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:22,002
但在那之前  躲起来  现在赶紧离开
but until then, lay low. Now go.

577
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:23,063
好的
Okay.

578
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:48,089
-我们走  -去哪
- Let's go. - Where are we going?

579
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:50,039
我得去一趟联合国总部  
I have to go to the U.N.,

580
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,007
总部已准许暂时释放你并由我监管
and division has given you a temporary furlough into my custody.

581
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,081
因为你之前是联合国的安保工作的总指挥
Since you had earlier command of UN security,

582
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,080
协调好签署仪式的安保方案及部署工作
coordinating protocols and deployment for the signing ceremony.

583
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,074
皮勒同意了吗
And Pillar's okay with this?

584
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:03,002
我依然是临时主管
I'm still provisional Director of Operations.

585
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,061
我不需要获得他的批准
I don't need his consent.

586
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,085
那么你是跟我来  
So, are you coming,

587
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:08,016
还是更愿意在这等候对你的联邦诉讼
or would you rather wait here for your federal prosecution?

588
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,050
我们走
Let's go.

589
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,079
他就交给我了
I'll take him from here.

590
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:18,035
-你要告诉我到底是怎么回事吗  -是的
- You want to tell me what's really going on? - Yeah.

591
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:25,018
你说的没错  确实有人帮杰克
You were right about Jack. He is working with somebody.

592
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,028
詹姆斯·理查尔  前中情局情报特工
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA Op.

593
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,099
我们已经找到他的在梅瑟大街的住所了
We found him living at a place on Mercer Street

594
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,039
他的化名叫西蒙·斯托克
under the alias Simon Strocker.

595
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:35,083
或许他还在为政府工作
Maybe he's still with the company.

596
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,083
不  我向中情局确认过了  他被列为已死亡
No. I checked with Langley. He was listed as deceased.

597
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,054
他更有可能在以军火或情报交易
More than likely, he's gone into business for himself,

598
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,066
为自己牟利  无论怎样
dealing arms or intel. In any case,

599
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,049
我们找到他的话他一定不会高兴的
he's not going to be happy we tracked him down.

600
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,067
等等  你为什么要告诉我这些
Wait a second. Why are you telling me this?

601
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,028
我要你去跟他谈谈
I need you to talk to him.

602
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,075
让他说出杰克的下落
Get him to tell us where Jack is.

603
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,027
你能处理好吗  或者你还没想好该站哪边
Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides?

604
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:55,095
我跟你一样想让真相大白于天下  算上我
I want to expose this cover-up as much as you. I'm in.

605
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:59,056
好  登记表上会显示你跟我一同去了联合国
Good. Log sheets will show you accompanying me to the UN.

606
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,098
我找了一辆车在门口等你
I've secured you a separate vehicle waiting at the gate.

607
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,075
有更多关于杰克的消息吗  他重新露面了吗
Is there any more intel on Jack? Has he resurfaced again?

608
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,030
是的  可以那么说
Yeah, you could say that.

609
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:12,012
阁下  我刚收到消息
Sir, I just received word.

610
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:14,075
萨瓦洛夫总统的专机已抵达肯尼迪机场
President Suvarov's plane has touched down at Kennedy Airport.

611
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,049
告诉伊万把车开来
Tell Ivan to bring the car around.

612
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,050
我要在联合国总部等候总统大驾
I want to be at the UN when the president arrives.

613
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,091
是的  长官

614
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,033
我五分钟内到前门

615
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:48,045
诺瓦科维奇在哪
Where's Novakovich?

616
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,024
-我不会再问第二遍  -十一楼
- I'm not going to ask you again. - 11th.

617
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,073
十一楼  1170套房内
11th floor, suite 1170.

618
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:53,083
我怎么上去
How do I get up there?

619
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:56,000
停车场里有安全电梯
Secure elevator inside of garage.

620
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:57,083
-你的门卡在哪  -我没有门卡
- Where's your keycard? - I don't have one.

621
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,098
你的门卡在哪
Where is your keycard?

622
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,043
我真的没有  我发誓
I don't have one, I swear.

623
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,047
他的贴身保镖在电梯那  他们有门卡
His personal guards have them at elevator.

624
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,049
-有多少人  -两人
- How many? - Two.

625
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,018
房间外一名  里面有两名
One outside the suite, two inside.

626
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:10,041
还有一名守在电梯那
Another by elevator.

627
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:13,031
还有哪里有  还有吗
Where else? Where else?!

628
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,073
就这些  我就知道这么多了
That's all. That's all I know.

629
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,086
你真需要那么多武器吗
Do you really need an arsenal?

630
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:41,026
有备无患
Better to have it than to not.

631
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,091
毕竟理查尔是个训练有素的杀手
Besides, Ricker's a trained killer.

632
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,080
他肯定身经百战才得以隐姓埋名
He's gone to a lot of trouble to stay off the grid.

633
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,005
有道理
Fair enough.

634
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,032
我还得考虑到万一杰克和他在一起呢
I also have to consider the possibility that Jack's with him.

635
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:52,075
听着  克罗伊
Listen, Chloe,

636
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,071
从你告诉我他对罗根的所作所为后
I can't be worried about Jack anymore,

637
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,051
我不能再考虑杰克的安全了
not after what you told me he did to Logan.

638
00:33:56,086 --> 00:33:58,073
显然  罗根也参与了此次阴谋
Obviously, Logan's part of the conspiracy.

639
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:02,005
他手持自动步枪暴力突袭了满是上班族的隧道
He terrorized a tunnel full of commuters with automatic weapon fire.

640
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:04,006
他居然对特勤组探员开枪
He shot Secret Service agents.

641
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:06,084
他只是打伤了他们
He shot to wound.

642
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,025
他根本不在乎  他在乎的只是复仇
He's careless, and he only cares about revenge.

643
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,024
你觉得他还是你认识的那个人吗
Does that sound like the man you know?

644
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,001
还是你想保护的那个人吗
Like the man you're trying to save?

645
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:17,025
这一切只是为了揭穿俄罗斯人掩盖真相的阴谋
This is about exposing the Russians' cover-up.

646
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,071
不是为了杰克
It's not about Jack.

647
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:20,060
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

648
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,041
因为如果杰克在那
Because if Jack's there,

649
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,038
他如果有任何拘捕的举动
and he makes any move other than complete surrender...

650
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,051
我会把他放倒的
I'm putting him down.

651
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,064
你还想要我去吗
You still want me to go?

652
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:34,026
我别无选择
I don't really have a choice.

653
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:39,018
无论发生什么  打电话到联合国找我
Whatever happens, call me at the U.N.

654
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,011
知道了
You got it.

655
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:53,075
在签署仪式之前  您可以直接进入会场
You'll approach the rostrum immediately prior to the signing ceremony,

656
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:56,062
就坐在这  三号位置  您母亲身边
and take a seat here in position three, next to your mother.

657
00:34:58,064 --> 00:34:59,078
但这合适吗
But is that appropriate?

658
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:01,048
我虽然是她的女儿
I may be her daughter,

659
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:04,002
但我在政府中没有任何正式职位
but I don't have any official role in government.

660
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:09,073
打扰下  哈桑女士  
Excuse me. Ms. Hassan,

661
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,067
您父亲的安全线路上有一个电话
there's a call on your father's secure line-

662
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:13,035
有位女士要求和您的母亲通话
a woman demanding to speak with your mother.

663
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,002
她正在开会
She's in a meeting.

664
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:17,011
我说了  不过她执意要见您母亲  
That's what I said, but this woman is quite insistent.

665
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,052
她是谁
Who is she?

666
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:19,072
她不愿说
She won't say.

667
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,082
我这边汇报完毕了  哈桑女士
We're done, Ms. Hassan.

668
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,036
等候区见
I'll see you in the staging area.

669
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:23,076
谢谢
Thank you.

670
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:24,099
二号线
Line two.

671
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:26,033
谢谢
Thank you.

672
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,076
你好  哪位
Hello. Who is this?

673
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:30,053
是凯拉吗
Is this Kayla?

674
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,087
你是谁
Who are you?

675
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,037
抱歉...
Sorry, um...

676
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,014
我叫梅瑞狄斯·里德
my name is Meredith Reed.

677
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,041
我需要跟你母亲通话
I need to speak to your mother.

678
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:39,004
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

679
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,074
你居然有脸往这里打电话
What do you think you're doing calling here?

680
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,028
我知道你和你母亲现在
I- I know I'm the last person

681
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:44,011
最不愿听到的就是我的声音
that either of you wants to talk to right now...

682
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,021
知道就好  我要挂了
You're right. I'm hanging up now.

683
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,026
不  求求你  
No, please, please,

684
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,068
在你母亲同泰勒总统签署协议前
your mother needs to hear what I have to say

685
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:51,019
一定要听听我说的
before she signs the agreement with President Taylor.

686
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:55,016
什么事这么重要
What is it that is so important?

687
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:58,013
抱歉  我必须直接同你母亲讲
I- I'm sorry, I need to speak to your mother directly.

688
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,040
你给我母亲带来的伤害还不够吗
Haven't you caused my mother enough pain?

689
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:02,006
离我们远点
Leave us alone!

690
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:04,077
此事事关谋杀你父亲的真凶
It's about the people who really murdered your father.

691
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,037
你说什么
What are you talking about?

692
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:10,040
我们知道凶手是谁
We know who was responsible.

693
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,058
但你不知道
What you don't know is,

694
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,075
这些凶手听命于一群俄罗斯间谍
those people were working under the orders of Russian agents.

695
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,093
什么
What?!

696
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:23,059
-喂  -你母亲开会回来时
- Hello?  - When your mother gets back from her meetings,

697
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:26,035
让她打我这个号码  请记一下
have her call me at this number- can you take this down?

698
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,006
说吧
Go ahead.

699
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:34,089
212-555-0121
It's 212-555-0121.

700
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:37,036
那时我会跟她把一切解释清楚的
I'll explain everything to her then.

701
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:38,093
等一下
Wait...!

702
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,044
梅瑞狄斯·里德
Meredith Reed?

703
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:50,016
联邦调查局   把手举起来
FBI. Get your hands where we can see 'em.

704
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,041
怎么回事
What is this?

705
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,064
等一下
Wait. Wait.

706
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:55,044
你们无权拿走它
You have no right to take that.

707
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:57,042
我什么坏事也没做
I- I haven't done anything wrong.

708
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,048
这是怎么回事
What is this?

709
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,075
你被逮捕了
You're under arrest.

710
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:03,075
-我什么坏事也没做  -我们走
- I - I've done nothing wrong. - Let's go.

711
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:05,099
我什么坏事也没做
I've done nothing wrong!

712
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,084
什么事
Yes?

713
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:21,037
伍兹先生来了  总统阁下
Mr. Woods, ma'am.

714
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:26,061
我刚从联邦调查局那得到消息
I've just received word from the FBI.

715
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,044
里德已经被捕
Reed is in custody,

716
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,068
他们在她身上搜出了一张数据卡
and they've secured a data card they found on her.

717
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:36,095
除了我谁都不许看卡里的内容
No one sees what's on it but me.

718
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:38,052
明白
Understood.

719
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,097
长官  下面交给我们了
Sir, we'll take it from here.

720
00:37:50,097 --> 00:37:52,067
不行  我要陪他一起去医院
No, you won't - I'm riding with him to the hospital.

721
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,030
回避一下
Give him some space.

722
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,030
诺瓦..诺瓦科维..
Nova... Novakov...

723
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,031
诺瓦..
Nova...

724
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:03,014

快去警告诺瓦科维奇  鲍尔去找他了
Warn Novakovich Bauer's coming after him.

727
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:11,095

Sir, we gotta get going.

728
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,079

我们遭到了袭击
We've been attacked.

738
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:05,060
所有人都死了
Everyone is dead.

739
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:11,061
伯科夫  诺瓦科维奇对鲍尔说过什么吗
Berkov, did Novakovich say anything to Bauer?

740
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:14,005
我需要辆救护车
I need an ambulance.

741
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,058
赶快回答我的问题
Just answer my question.

742
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:17,038
诺瓦科维奇跟鲍尔说什么了
What did Novakovich say to Bauer?

743
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:19,079
什么也没说  鲍尔进来就开枪
Nothing. Bauer just came in shooting.

744
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:22,002
不过他在流血
But he was bleeding.

745
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,046
估计是被一个保镖刺伤的
I think he was wounded by one of the guards.

746
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,093
好吧  别乱动  救护车马上就到
All right, sit tight; an ambulance is on the way.

747
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:33,053
走开
Go.

748
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,037
诺瓦科维奇死了
Novakovich is dead.

749
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:39,020
鲍尔把他杀了  还有他全部手下
Bauer killed him, killed all of his men...

750
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,050
我不知道诺瓦科维奇是否跟鲍尔说过什么
I don't know if Novakovich said anything to Bauer.

751
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,037
喂
Yes?

752
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,057
我是查尔斯·罗根
Charles Logan.

753
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:17,034
我本以为你会来直升机场接我
I was under the impression you were going to be at the heliport for my arrival.

754
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:19,024
这个嘛
Yes, well...

755
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:21,081
我这边遇到点麻烦
...I ran into some trouble.

756
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,078
恐怕是坏消息
I'm afraid I have bad news.

757
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:26,032
看起来米哈伊尔·诺瓦科维奇
It appears that Mikhail Novakovich

758
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:28,062
刚被杰克·鲍尔给杀了
was just murdered by Jack Bauer.

759
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:29,078
-什么  -是的
- What?! - Yeah,

760
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:35,016
鲍尔了解到诺瓦科维奇负责指挥并协调
and Bauer learned that Novakovich was responsible for ordering and...

761
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:38,023
对奥马·哈桑的刺杀行动
coordinating Omar Hassan's assassination,

762
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:41,000
以及萨米尔的那些勾当
as well as the rest of Samir's activities.

763
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,083
他从何处得知的
Where would he get that idea?

764
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,033
从我这里
From me.

765
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,050
那疯子要杀了我  尤里
The lunatic was gonna kill me, Yuri.

766
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,070
你还能指望我说什么
What can I say?

767
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:51,068
我想这也算是弃车保帅啊
Think of it as sacrificing a rook for a king.

768
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,021
那么  鲍尔还不知道
Then Bauer has no idea

769
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:56,085
诺瓦科维奇是遵从我的命令行事的  对吗
that Novakovich was operating under my orders?

770
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:58,008
是的
None.

771
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:00,049
据目击者所讲
Uh, according to a witness,

772
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:03,096
米哈伊尔就算想供你出来  都没机会
Mikhail didn't have a chance to give you up, even he wanted to.

773
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:07,049
对鲍尔来说
As far as Bauer is concerned...

774
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:09,073
做了诺瓦科维奇就完事了
the trail ended with Novakovich.

775
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,016
而且全城各执法部门都在搜捕他
And he's being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the city.

776
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:18,050
而且我听说他受伤了
And I've-I've heard that, uh...he's been wounded.

777
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:22,017
受伤的猛兽才是最可怕的
There is nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal.

778
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,087
如果你这么担心鲍尔的话
Look, if you're so worried about Bauer,

779
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:27,004
就不应该下令杀掉蕾妮·沃克
you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker.

780
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,068
就是这事捅了马蜂窝
That's what stirred up the hornet's nest.

781
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:33,084
如果我早知道你会发现我们的行动
If I had known that you were going to find out about our activities

782
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:35,008
并且用你所获得的情报
and use that information

783
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:38,038
来要挟我签署泰勒的和平协议的话
to blackmail me into signing Taylor's peace agreement,

784
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,085
我根本就不会动那个女人
I wouldn't have bothered with the woman.

785
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:42,089
木已成舟了  尤里
Water under the bridge, Yuri.

786
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:46,033
我当时需要一个重返政坛的机会
I needed an opportunity to put myself back in the game.

787
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,020
很抱歉只能以牺牲你为代价了
I'm sorry that it has come at your expense.

788
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:53,078
你不会同一个想东山再起的老朋友计较这些的吧
You wouldn't begrudge an old friend his second chance in the sun.

789
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:56,072
那好吧
All right, then.

790
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:59,081
我会在联合国总部跟你会面
I will- I will meet you at the United Nations...

791
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:01,088
我会尽快赶到
as soon as I can.
