所以搜捕队看见你就能认出来

待在原地  我看见他们的搜捕协议后

你不打算进行实验疗法来救你父亲了吗

这是他治愈的唯一机会啊
I mean, it's his only chance for a cure.

130
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,083
我知道  他也知道
I know that, and so does he.

131
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,036
但机会渺茫
But it's a slim one,

132
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,036
他觉得

133
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,016
不值得一试
It's not worth taking, so...

134

如果真的不幸发生  他希望独自承担
If he's going to die, he wants it to be on his terms.

对  但你不能让他回心转意吗
Yes, but can't you change his mind?

我爸爸一但下定决心

谁是阿尔梅达的消息来源

我又在不断重复了

00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:09,066
去等候区
To the holding area.

306
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,096
谢谢
Thank you.

307
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,046
这个人怎么会携带一罐生化武器
How could this man have gotten out of Starkwood

308
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:18,000
逃出斯塔克伍德的
With a canister of the bioweapon?

309
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,003
没人知道
No one's sure.

310
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,053
不过他已经杀了4个人
But he's already murdered four people.

311
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
包括拉里·莫斯
Including Larry Moss.

312
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,091
调查局追踪他
The FBI has tracked him

313
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,007
到了附近的一个居民区
To a nearby residential district.

314
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,058
他们封锁了整个区域
They've sealed off the area

315
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,074
正在展开地毯式搜查
And are conducting a thorough search.

316
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,078
妈  这个卡维兹在斯塔克伍德工作
Mom,this man Galvez is a Starkwood operative.

317
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,042
很明显  霍奇斯是幕后主谋
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

318
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:37,075
或许吧
Maybe.

319
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:39,039
你说或许是什么意思
What do you mean, maybe?

320
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,009
霍奇斯被逮捕时
As hodges was taken away,

321
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,012
他说还没结束
He said it wasn't over.

322
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,043
他提到了还有其他人
He alluded to others,

323
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:50,041
说他自己只是冰山一角
Called himself a small cog in a very large machine

324
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,092
我没有能力去阻止他们
That I wouldn't be able to stop.

325
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:53,024
他在危言耸听
He was ranting.

326
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,013
他不一定是在说谎
That doesn't mean he wasn't telling the truth.

327
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,030
我们要查清楚霍奇斯到底知道些什么
We need to find out what Hodges knows about this.

328
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:00,041
把他带去调查局审问
I want him taken to the FBI for interrogation.

329
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,044
妈  他是反社会者
He's a sociopath, mom.

330
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:04,051
他不会交代的  他一定会
He's not going to talk. He's going to want

331
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:07,035
以合作为条件来跟你谈交易
To make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.

332
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,019
妈  你不是想
Mom, you're not considering that...

333
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,032
奥利维亚
Olivia...

334
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,029
你了解这个人  知道他对罗杰做了什么
You know what this man is, what he did to roger.

335
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:18,036
把他带去调查局
Just get him to FBI.

336
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,084
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges.

337
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,069
你的律师到了
Your attorney's here to see you.

338
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,051
在这个该死的时候
Well, it's about damn time.

339
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:47,042
我们想私下谈谈
We're going to need some privacy.

340
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,086
你比她高一点
You're a little taller than her.

341
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:57,090
但这样也挺漂亮
But it's a good look for you.

342
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,090
你好  乔纳斯
Hello, Jonas.

343
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,090
我不关心你是怎样进来的
I'm not going to ask how you got in.

344
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:06,017
我感兴趣的是你要如何把我弄出去
But i'm definitely interested in how you're going to get me out.

345
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,038
乔纳斯  你现在已是自身难保
Jonas, you're in a very difficult position.

346
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,038
你今天的所作所为
And your actions today have put everyone else

347
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,005
也让其他人寸步难行
In a very difficult position.

348
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,088
我明白了
Oh, I see.

349
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,089
我让他们不高兴了  对吧
I've upset the cart, have I?

350
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:22,089
每个人都很生气
Everyone's bent out of shape.

351
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,089
可是  政府冲着我公司发难时
Well, where the hell were they

352
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:26,073
他们又在哪里呢
When the government came after my company?

353
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
迈尔参议员和他的那群喽啰
When senator Mayer and his subpoena-waving goon squad

354
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,093
要毁掉我和我的心血时  他们在哪里
Were trying to ruin me and everything I've built?

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,097
我们本来可以提供保护的  乔纳斯
You would have been protected, Jonas.

356
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:36,010
保护你和斯塔克伍德
You and Starkwood.

357
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:39,011
但你差点毁了整个计划
But you jeopardized the plan.

358
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,074
你为我们研制的生化武器
That bioweapon that you developed for us was

359
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,081
不应用作私人用途
Not intended for personal use.

360
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,015
大家一致认为
The consensus

361
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,065
你有某种程度上的
Is that you've had some sort of...

362
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,065
精神崩溃
Psychotic break.

363
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,065
他们想错了
Well, the consensus is wrong.

364
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,092
现在听你说这句话  我们并不会感到安慰
Coming from you right now, that's not much comfort.

365
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,096
我要跟他们谈谈
I want to talk to them.

366
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,033
帮我联系一下
Get some form of communication between us.

367
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,059
我要跟他们谈谈
I want to talk to them.

368
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,020
为时已晚  乔纳斯
I think it's a little late for that, Jonas.

369
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,037
你的牌摊的太大了
You've brought undue attention by showing your hand.

370
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,067
暴露了你自己
Exposing yourself.

371
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,094
我知道你能理解
And I'm sure you could understand

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,017
他们觉得你或许会
Their concern that you may,

373
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,067
揭发其他人的顾虑
In fact, expose the others as well.

374
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,037
我能做到吗  我连他们是谁都不知道
How can I do that? I don't know who they are.

375
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,068
你知道的够多了  他们要确保没人透露
You know enough, and they need to be certain.

376
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,095
我想我们可以达成一致
I think we can agree

377
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,098
你的家人没有必要
That there's no reason for your family

378
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:24,098
为你的错误负责
To pay for your mistakes.

379
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,065
这就是你来的原因吗
Is that why you're here?

380
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,099
以我的家人威胁我
To threaten my family.

381
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,052
与此相反
On the contrary.

382
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,079
我来是要确保你家人的安全
I came to guarantee your family's safety.

383
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:35,049
如果你照我说的做
If you do the right thing.

384
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,010
这会让你心跳停止
It'll induce cardiac arrest,

385
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,084
而且不会留下痕迹
And leave no trace in your system.

386
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:49,001
自然地  有尊严地死去
A natural, dignified death.

387
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,084
到时他们无法对你进行起诉
Without you to prosecute,

388
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,021
这个针对你和你的公司的案子
The case against you and your

389
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:55,015
会很难继续  几乎不可能
Company will be difficult, likely impossible.

390
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,048
你这样做至少也是对
Preserving at least some small part

391
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,052
斯塔克伍德爱国传统的一些体现
Of starkwood's legacy of patriotic service.

392
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,039
我知道那对你来说很重要
Which I know is very important to you.

393
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,025
时间到了  律师
Party's over, counselor.

394
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:27,078
我们要把他转去调查局
We're moving him to the bureau.

395
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,088
我的委托人有权保持沉默
My client has invoked his right to silence and to counsel.

396
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,058
没我在场
No one speaks to him

397
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,059
谁都不能和他说话  明白吗
Unless in my presence, is that understood?

398
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,052
在一些国家他早就被枪毙了
In some countries they'd have shot him by now.

399
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,062
把他带走
Process him out.

400
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,071
请讲
Yes?

401
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,095
我见过他了
I met with him.

402
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,011
还有呢
And?

403
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:03,012
我确信他明白我们的意思
I'm quite certain he understands our terms.

404
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,012
他会被送到调查局接受审问
They're transferring him to the FBI for interrogation.

405
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,032
会有问题吗
Will that be a problem?

406
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,085
希望不会  那只会给他压力
Hopefully,it'll just pressure him

407
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,086
让他尽快下定决心
to resolve the situation sooner rather than later.

408
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:12,009
形势对我方有利后我就放宽心了
I'll be happy when this is behind us.

409
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,063
有阿尔梅达的消息吗
Have you heard from Almeida?

410
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,063
见到霍奇斯之前我接到了他的电话
He called in before I met with Hodges.

411
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,063
他拿到毒气罐了吗
Has he secured the canister?

412
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,063
很快
Soon.

413
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,030
他是你的人  最好别搞砸了
He's your guy. Better not screw this up.

414
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:25,040
托尼总是能力挽狂澜  转危为安
Tony's been the one bright spot in an otherwise dreary day.

415
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,047
我相信他能做好
I have faith he'll come through.

416
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,041
喂
Yeah?

417
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,015
我找到了一个安置点
I found a place to set up.

418
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,098
是一栋废弃的居民楼
It's an abandoned apartment building

419
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,032
距北边封锁线不远
just shy of the north perimeter line.

420
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,012
林孔街1297号  12大街的街角
1297 Rincon, corner of 12th.

421
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,052
好  我看到了
Yeah,I see it.

422
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,086
搜捕队刚刚进入
Sweep teams are just entering

423
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,053
南部的三个区
three sectors to the south.

424
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,020
你有不到20分钟
You've got less than 20 minutes.

425
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:50,043
时间不够啊
That doesn't give me much time.

426
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,090
是不够  所以你得
No,it doesn't, so maybe you

427
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:54,033
挂了电话赶紧干活儿
should get off the phone and get to it.

428
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,081
我曾连续失去过两个搭档
I lost two partners in a row.

429
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:40,001
早些时候
Early on.

430
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,005
我无能为力
I couldn't handle it.

431
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:49,026
我想这就是为什么在过去十年里
I guess that's why over the last ten years,

432
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:51,072
我一直是一个人单打独斗
I've pretty much worked alone.

433
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:58,043
去想这些悲伤的事情也没什么
It's all right for you to be feeling what you feel.

434
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,057
但你今晚不能这样消沉
And if you can't do this tonight,

435
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:02,060
也没什么
that's all right,too.

436
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,094
只是不要试着逞强
Just don't try and pretend

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,061
别装着自己什么感觉都没有
like you're not feeling anything.

438
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,051
要是那样就不对了
That's how you make a mistake.

439
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,034
拜托  杰克  不用教我该用什么感受
Please,Jack,don't tell me what to feel

440
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,028
或者如何调整心情
and don't tell me how to feel it.

441
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,073
沃克探员
Agent Walker.

442
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:46,018
他在那儿
He's over there.

443
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,065
-杰克  -他在哪
-Jack! -Where is he?

444
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:53,032
-他从这边跑了  -你还好吧
-He's running through this way. -You okay?

445
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,039
没事我很走运
Yeah,I got lucky.

446
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:55,089
子弹和要害部位擦肩而过
The bullet went straight through.

447
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,032
没想到在这儿会见到你
Didn't think I'd see you out here.

448
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
我来就是看看
I'm only here for observation.

449
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,080
你没必要这么做
You do not have to do this.

450
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,047
让我看
Show me.

451
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,006
盖上吧
Cover him up.

452
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:47,054
节哀顺变
I'm sorry about Larry.

453
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,048
这到底是怎么发生的
How the hell did this happen?

454
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:52,094
一切发生得都太快了  我是说
It all went down pretty fast,I mean...

455
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,071
我们还没下直升机就遭到伏击
We were ambushed before we got out of the helicopter.

456
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:58,082
驾驶员首先中弹
The chopper pilot was hit first.

457
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,039
我没带武器  拉里就掩护我
I was unarmed,so Larry laid down cover

458
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,039
我才得以逃生
so I could get clear.

459
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:05,092
我不记得太多  但的确有自动步枪的声音
I don't remember a lot,but I definitely heard auto-fire.

460
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,043
我被人追杀  拉里过来
As I was tagged, Larry came over

461
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,070
帮我  结果自己中弹
to help me out and that's when he was hit.

462
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:14,017
之后我就晕倒了
I blacked out after that.

463
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:17,024
但我确定是拉里救了我的命
But I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life.

464
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,034
拉里是被重武器打死的
Larry was hit with heavy ordnance.

465
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,081
身上有霰弹的碎片
Shotgun rounds,armor piercing.

466
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:22,057
你却明显是被小型武器击中的
You were obviously hit with something smaller.

467
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,014
我验过阿尔梅达先生的伤
I treated Mr. Almeida.

468
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,038
他的伤都是九毫米大
His wound was consistent with a nine millimeter.

469
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,038
你确定不是点四五口径
You sure it wasn't a .45?

470
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,088
不像  伤口太小  为什么这么问
Not likely-- the entry was too small. Why?

471
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:33,092
因为你们曾把点四五口径武器放在显眼处
Because you have spent .45 casings in evidence.

472
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,066
卡维兹能从调查局丢的车里搞到武器
Galvez had access to the weapons inside the FBI vehicle he stole here.

473
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,066
他可能会在火拼中换掉武器
He probably switched in the middle of the fight.

474
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,019
能换掉那么多
That many weapons?

475
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:44,016
你刚刚说的伏击时间很短啊
In the time frame that you described the ambush?

476
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,056
这可不合情理啊
It doesn't add up.

477
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:47,022
-好吧  那你的意思呢   -他有同党
- Okay,so what are you saying?  - Someone was with him.

478
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,000
我刚说了  一切发生得太快  但是
Like I said,it all happened pretty fast,but...

479
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,077
我是说  我不这么想
I mean,I didn't think so.

480
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:57,034
我觉得有道理
I guess it makes sense.

481
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,061
一个人做不到  他有帮手
One man didn't do this alone. He had help.

482
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:02,075
我去让帕克警戒这个区域
I'll tell Park to alert the field.

483
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,075
你确定你没事
You sure you're okay?

484
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,055
是  我很好
Yeah,I'm fine.

485
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,019
好
Good.

486
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,087
喂
Hello?

487
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,040
我吵醒你了吗
Did I wake you?

488
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:32,010
今天发这种事谁还睡得着
Who could sleep after what happened today?

489
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:33,090
你爸怎么样
How did it go with your father?

490
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:38,084
亲爱的  怎么了
Sweetheart,what is it?

491
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,041
怎么了
What happened?

492
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,065
他快死了  史蒂芬
He's dying,Stephen.

493
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,041
什么
What?

494
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,085
他被某种病毒感染了
He was exposed to something.

495
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,062
某种生化制剂
Like a biological agent.

496
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,025
和今天早些时候
It had something to do with the attacks

497
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,096
发生的袭击事件有关
that took place earlier today.

498
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,099
金  亲爱的  实在抱歉
Kim,honey,I'm so sorry.

499
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:02,040
还有治愈的希望吗
Um,isn't there anything that they can do?

500
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,080
没有
No.

501
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,057
我马上回家
I'm coming back home.

502
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:09,027
你不想留下吗  你不想
Don't you want to stay? Don't you wanna

503
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,027
尽可能多地陪他吗
be with him as long as you can?

504
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,028
我待在那儿
My presence,

505
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,085
他现在却受着苦
with what he's going through right now,

506
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:17,061
这只会让事情更糟
will only make things worse.

507
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:22,008
那你有没有告诉他
Did you at least,um,

508
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:24,052
告诉他  他有孙女了吗
Did you tell him about his granddaughter?

509
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:29,009
金
Kim?

510
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,036
我不能  史蒂芬
I couldn't,Stephen.

511
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,009
我不能告诉他
I couldn't bring myself to tell him

512
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:35,067
他不仅会扔下我一个
I wasn't the only person he was leaving behind.

513
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:38,094
跟他说泰瑞只会让事情更糟
Telling him about Teri would've only made it worse.

514
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,047
我会试着走610次航班  如果我赶上的话
I'm gonna trying get on the 610. If I do.

515
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,094
我九点就能到洛杉矶
I'll be back in L.A. by 9.

516
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,027
好
Okay.

517
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:48,014
要是改变注意了  就多留在那儿一会儿吧
You can always leave later, if you change your mind.

518
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,071
不会的
I won't.

519
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,068
我爱你们
I love you both.

520
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:56,032
我们也爱你
We love you,too.

521
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,039
再见

522
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,097
移动指挥部  我是9号搜捕队

-继续搜索224区域  -收到

移动指挥部  我们遇到一些

528
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:23,021
社区内居民的阻挠
from neighborhood residents.

529
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:24,098
他们很不高兴  觉得不应该在凌晨两点半
They're not happy about their homes being searched

530
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,092
没有事先通知就搜查他们的房子
wIthout warning at 2:30 in the morning.

531
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,082
我在乎的是他们的安全  不是他们的心情
I'm concerned about their safety,not their happiness.

532
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,005
协助卡维兹的人可能会给他提供藏身之处
Whoever is helping Galvez may be providing him shelter

533
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:33,016
可能就是其中某间房屋  要是那些人
in one of those houses. If those civilians are

534
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:35,003
继续阻碍搜捕  先逮捕他们  再继续任务

你为什么不呆在局里接受治疗

544
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,028

你为什么来现场

沃克探员的搭档刚刚牺牲了  托尼

00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:35,045
如果你对我撒谎  我会亲自把你杀了
If you were lying to me I'd kill you myself.

766
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:37,049
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

767
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,012
卡蒂夫  文森特·卡蒂夫
Cardiff,vincent cardiff--

768
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,076
你说他在审讯期间死了
You said he was killed during his interrogation.

769
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,079
是啊  怎么了
Yeah,so?

770
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:44,020
他好端端的活着  被逮捕了
He's alive and well,in custody,

771
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,026
根本没有曾被虐待的迹象
And he's showing no signs of physical abuse.

772
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,040
解释下
Explain that.

773
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:51,054
好吧  听着  杰克  抱歉
All right,look, Jack,I'm sorry.

774
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,034
卡蒂夫知道一但他泄露了情报
Cardiff knew that by spilling that intel,

775
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,097
肯定会活不成
He was going to get himself killed,

776
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,000
我说我可以让调查局认为
I told him i'd let the FBI think

777
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,028
他已经死了  让他可以逃匿
He was dead,so he could walk away and disappear.

778
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,092
我认为那是无关紧要的谎话
I thought it was just a meaningless lie.

779
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:05,018
你和我干这行那么多年早应该知道
You and I have been doing this long enough to know

780

根本就没有谎话是无关紧要的

你在其中扮演什么角色
How are you involved in this?

782
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:09,082
杰克  你这样说没有道理
You're not making any sense,Jack.

783
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:11,022
那情报是对的
That intel was good.

784
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,076
没那情报你进不了白宫
Without it you'd have never been in the white house

785
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,076
救不了总统
To save the president.

786
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,009
你到底扮演什么角色
What is your involvement?!

787
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
你头脑不清醒了
You're not thinking straight.

788
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:20,027
你是怎么中枪的
How were you shot?

789
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:22,087
是卡维斯真的还有同伙
Does galvez even have a second man...

790
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,024
还是那个同伙就是你
Or was it just you?

791
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,087
住嘴  听下你刚才说的
Just stop and listen to what you're saying.

792
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,084
这是扯淡  精神错乱
It's insane. It's paranoia.

793
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,068
快把枪放下吧
Now,why don't you put the gun down?

794
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:32,024
别动
Don't you move!

795
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:34,068
毒素在影响你的判断能力
The toxin is starting to affect your judgment.

796
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:37,028
你知道的  不是吗
That's what's happening. you can see that,right?

797
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,064
这就是你要找的东西对吧
Is this what you're looking for?

798
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:02,054
我不想伤害你  杰克
I never wanted to hurt you,Jack.

799
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,078
我告诉过你别管这事
I told you to stay out of it.

800
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,061
但你就是不听  是吧
But you wouldn't listen, would you?

801
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:12,025
我需要帮助  他开始抽搐了
Can we get some help here? this man's having a seizure.

802
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,000
请后退
Stand back,please.

803
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,029
去拿下我的包  给梅塞尔医生打电话
Go get my bag and call Dr. Mason.

804
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:58,046
我没看到伤口
I don't see anything.

805
00:41:58,053 --> 00:41:59,050
伤口肯定在背部
The wound must be posterior.

806
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:02,047
长官  我需要你翻个身
Sir,I need to turn you on your side.

807
