我是埃克·杜巴库上校
This is Colonel Ike Dubaku.

3
00:00:17,063 --> 00:00:20,063
我们拥有CIP装置
We have the CIP device.

4
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:23,053
明日此时
We demand the complete withdrawal

5
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:25,047
美国的海军
of the U.S. Naval Strike Force

6
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:27,087
必须全部撤退
by this time tomorrow.

7
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,037
你要撤兵
You are recalling the invasion force.

8
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:32,057
此事尚需考虑
Well, that determination has yet to be made.

9
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:33,077
我请求你
I implore you

10
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:35,081
别放弃我的国家
do not abandon my country.

11
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:38,005
是萨曼莎·罗斯
It's Samantha Roth.

12
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,098
她说她要告诉我
She says, she has new information

13

罗杰被安排审计部门内部的经纪人

15
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:46,015
他发现了其他的地下账户
He uncovered other blind accounts

16
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,095
根据这些账户我们追查到
accounts that were traced to a senior member

17
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:50,016
你妻子的一位高级官员
of your wife's administration.

18
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,019

他所知的一切

21
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:56,040
肯定是鲍尔和阿尔梅达的手下
Bauer must have worked out this escape

22
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,090
一起策划了逃跑
with Almeida's people.

23
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,037
我被这混蛋给耍了
That son of a bitch played me.

24
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:00,083
他骗我说局里已遭渗透
Had me believing the Bureau was compromised--

25
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,030
有人在内部搞鬼
someone on the inside working against us.

26
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,024
现如今我才知道都是他搞的鬼
I realize now it was him all along.

27
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,011
我们俩都被耍了
He played us both.

28
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:07,077
我要挽回这个错误  拉里
I'm going to make this right, Larry.

29
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:10,034
我要不惜代价找到鲍尔和阿尔梅达
Whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida.

30
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:12,051
你时间不多了  坦纳  把你知道的都说出来
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner. Tell me what you know.

31
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,045
我半个字都不会说
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.

32
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,052
阿尔梅达在哪里
Where is Almeida?

33
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,059
坦纳说阿尔梅达那伙人计划绑架
Tanner says Almeida's crew has a plan to abduct

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,092
桑加拉前总理
former Prime Minister of Sangala.

35
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,015
马托波
Matobo?

36
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,036
-什么时候  -差不多是现在
- When? - Pretty much now.

37
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:24,009
你为什么不让当局来处理
Why didn't you call the authorities?

38
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,066
-他不能  杰克  -为什么
- He couldn't, Jack. - Why not?

39
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:28,010
他发现爱默生的客户正是杜巴库
He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.

40
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,060
你认为他在政府里安插了间谍
That's who you believe has agents inside the government.

41
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,047
杜巴库是整件事的关键
Dubaku is the key to this thing, Jack.

42
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,037
要想揭露这个阴谋
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy

43
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,067
我们必须在他离开美国前找到他
we have to get to him before he leaves the U.S.

44
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,097
-我从联调局逃了出来  -听说了
- I got away from the FBI. - Yeah, I heard.

45
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,084
我还听说是杰克·鲍尔帮你逃脱的
I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out.

46
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,034
他是我们的人了
He's on board now.

47
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,081
"货"是一个人
The package is a person.

48
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:49,048
桑加拉前总理  马托波
Former Prime Minister Matobo of Sangala.

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,063
任务就是抓住他  并移交给杜巴库上校
The assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,010
马托波在哪里  他在哪里
Where's Matobo?! Where is he?!

51
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:04,053
这是藏身处  钢筋混凝土结构
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.

52
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,013
杰克  如果我们空手而归
Jack, we leave here without Matobo

53
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:08,041
就会失去抓住杜巴库的唯一机会
we lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku.

54
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:15,017
以下事件发生于下午12点至1点之间

55
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,064
马托波的警卫长说
Matobo's security chief

56
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,061
他住处有一个藏身处
said there's a safe room at his residence.

57
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,085
他们夫妇应该已经进入躲避
They should have him and his wife locked down by now.

58
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,032
他们不会有事
They'll be safe till your team gets there.

59
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,059
抓阿尔梅达是要务  把他带回来
Your priority is to grab Almeida and bring him back here.

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,036
我们会尽量使用非致命武器
We'll make every effort to use nonlethal force

61
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:30,036
但阿尔梅达那伙人都是军人出身
but Almeida's crew is ex-military.

62
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:32,023
要制服他们不太容易
They're going to be hard to subdue

63
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,076
除非我的人可以回击
unless my men can return fire.

64
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:35,070
你的人将置身险境  我理解
I understand you'll be exposing your men

65
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,036
-但是你必须冒这个险  -长官
- but it's a risk you need to take. - Sir...

66
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,033
阿尔梅达是目前唯一能帮我们
Almeida is the only viable lead we've got

67
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,043
取回CIP装置的人
to retrieve the CIP device.

68
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,077
一定要留活口  明白吗
You need to bring him in alive, is that understood?

69
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:46,001
明白
Understood.

70
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,067
行动
Let's move out.

71
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:50,015
上车后会得到最新情况
We'll get our updates in the van.

72
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,026
打开藏身处大门
Open the safe room.

73
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,049
我会打到你开门为止
I will keep going until you open the door.

74
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,019
我说过
I've already told you.

75
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,086
门一旦关闭  就只能从里面打开
Once it's closed, you can only open it from the inside.

76
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,016
随你怎样处置我
Do whatever you want to me

77
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:14,028
但你永远都进不去
but you will never get into that room.

78
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,074
我们必须抓到马托波
We've got to get Matobo.

79
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,084
抓不到他  我们将一无所获
Without him, we've got nothing.

80
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,025
我知道
I know.

81
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:30,038
-想到办法进去了吗  -没有
- Find a way in yet? - No.

82
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,075
利特法克  有办法重接内部通话线路吗
Litvak, any luck reconnecting the intercom?

83
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,099
还没
Not yet.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,063
正在试
I'm working on it.

85
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,057
长官  刚才收到
Sir, this just came in...

86
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,000
我正在指挥外勤行动  艾丽卡
I'm in the middle of a field op, Erika.

87
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,040
现在没空
I don't really have a lot of time right now.

88
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,074
司法部长发过来的
It's from the attorney general.

89
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,020
我觉得你该抽空看看
I think you should make time for this.

90
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:53,001
-什么东西  -坦纳的律师正准备
- What is it? - Tanner's lawyers are filing a complaint

91
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,075
投诉联调局
against the Bureau.

92
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,053
沃克
Walker.

93
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,096
蕾妮  是我
Renee, it's me.

94
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:16,076
十五分钟内我会抵达马托波家
I'm less than 15 minutes away from Matobo's house.

95
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,077
到达后我会给战术小组侦查
When I get there, I'll recon for the Tac Team.

96
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:21,002
-等下  -怎么
- Stop a second. - What?

97
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:25,026
你是如何得知
This information about Matobo being abducted...

98
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,073
马托波正遭绑一事
tell me how you got it

99
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,052
你应该知道啊  审问坦纳得来的
You know how I got it--I questioned Tanner.

100
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:31,000
-你审问他了  -对
- You questioned him? - Yeah.

101
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,008
坦纳的律师说
Tanner's lawyers are saying

102
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,030
你把他们锁在医院病房外
you locked them out of his hospital room,

103
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,048
切断了他的呼吸机
then cut off his ventilator.

104
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,017
他们还说你向他的伤口施压
They said you applied pressure to his gunshot wound

105
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,023
我们得找到阿尔梅达
We needed Almeida's location

106
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,093
坦纳不配合
Tanner was not about to cooperate

107
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:45,037
所以你就严刑逼供
So you tortured him.

108
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,059
你脑子进水了吗
What the hell were you thinking?

109
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:53,084
我拿到了所需情报
I got the information we needed.

110
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,030
情报真假尚不明了
Information that may not even be valid.

111
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,030
你我心知肚明
You know as well as I do,

112
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,032
严刑逼供不可靠
Coercive interrogation is unreliable.

113
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,034
-不  坦纳没说谎  -你怎么知道
- No, Tanner was not lying.  - You know that?

114
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,068
他不是顺水推舟骗你的
how do you know he wasn't just telling you what you wanted to hear?

115
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,035
等到了马托波那  就清楚了
I'll find out when I get to Matobo's house.

116
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:06,055
不行  不准你去那
No, you're not going to Matobo's.

117
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,091
你马上给我回办公室来
You're coming back here to the office.

118
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:09,028
司法部长派人来
The attorney general is sending somebody here,

119
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:11,005
你要跟他汇报发生的一切
and you're going to tell him everything that happened.

120
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,049
拉里
Larry...

121
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,076
鲍尔跟阿尔梅达跑掉是我的错
it's my fault that Bauer and Almeida are still at large.

122
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:16,019
求你了  让我了解此事
Please, let me play this out.

123
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,042
找到CIP装置后
I will deal with the consequences

124
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,016
一切责任我来承担
after we find the CIP device.

125
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,016
不行  外勤组已经出发  他们处理就行了
No, the field team is on the way, they can handle this.

126
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:23,006
蕾妮
Renee,

127
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,037
马上给我回来
get back here now.

128
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,037
对不起  拉里
I'm sorry, Larry,

129
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,050
我必须弥补过错
but I need to make this right.

130
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,015
蕾妮
Renee?

131
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,092
该死的
Damn it.

132
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,085
你没事太好了  宝贝
I'm glad you're all right, babe.

133
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,046
机务人员说
The flight attendant said something about us getting

134
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,092
我们得到优先降落权
a priority clearance to land.

135
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,033
你真幸运
Uh, you got lucky.

136
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,079
是吗
Did I?

137
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,086
咱俩通话后  飞机就获得了优先降落权
I mean, it happened just after we spoke,

138
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,093
我总感觉  这件事跟你有关
so I thought maybe you had something to do with it.

139
00:05:58,094 --> 00:06:00,077
我吗  我怎么可能做得到
Me? How could I have done anything?

140
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:03,051
听我说  我今天回家会晚些
Listen, I might be late tonight.

141
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,094
这有好多工作要做
There's a lot going on at work.

142
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:06,061
我都一个星期没见到你了
I haven't seen you in a week.

143
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,094
咱们也应该在一起
I thought we could spend some time together.

144
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,075
吃个晚餐  或者
Dinner, and maybe...

145
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,018
那个一下
...you know.

146
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,028
对不起  我得挂了  工作繁忙
Sorry, I have to go. I have to get back to work.

147
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,068
再打给我
Call me later.

148
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,079
好的
Okay.

149
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,086
外勤组布置妥当了吗
Did you deploy the field teams?

150
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,092
是的  他们刚出发
Yeah, they just left.

151
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,039
我们得跟马托波的警卫长协调
We need to coordinate with Matobo's security chief

152
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,030
再打电话给他
get him back on the line.

153
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:41,061
这些人为杜巴库卖命  是不是
These people, they work for Dubaku, don't they?

154
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,061
有可能
Possibly.

155
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,035
是的  或许是
Yes, probably.

156
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,028
但如果他们想杀我  我早已经死了
But if they wanted me dead,I would be dead.

157
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,075
那他们想干吗
Then what do they want?

158
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,008
名单
Names.

159
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,009
名单
Names?

160
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,009
桑加拉内部  与我同盟者的名单
Of my allies inside Sangala.

161
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,023
你宁死也不会说的  他们很清楚
You would die before you exposed them, they know that.

162
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:01,077
是的  他们知道  但是
Yes, they do, but..

163
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:09,018
问题在我这
Then it's me.

164
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,064
问题出在我这
It's me.

165
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:16,011
他们打算以我为要挟  逼你说出来
They want to use me to get you to talk?

166
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,064
别担心
Don't worry.

167
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:20,058
我们在这里很安全  他们走了就好了
We'll be safe in here until they leave.

168
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,049
乌勒  我害怕
Ule, I'm scared.

169
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,090
阿拉玛  听我说
Alama, listen to me.

170
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:25,010
我们得冷静
We need to stay calm.

171
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,020
我们会平安无事的
We'll be fine.

172
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,010
联调局知道我们被困于此
The FBI knows we are here.

173
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,034
他们会火速前来营救我们
They'll come for us soon.

174
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,028
别担心
Okay?

175
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,025
马托波先生
Mr. Matobo?

176
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:42,042
我知道您能听见  也能看见我
I know you can see and hear me.

177
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:44,089
出来吧  不必有人受伤
Come out now and nobody has to get hurt.

178
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,043
别浪费时间了
You are wasting your time.

179
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,070
快出来  不然我会杀了你的手下
Come out now or I will kill your man.

180
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:57,068
给你一分钟时间
You have one minute.

181
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,049
50秒
Fifty...

182
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,045
我愿为您捐躯  长官
I am prepared to die, sir.

183
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:13,080
为了您  为了桑加拉
For you and for Sangala.

184
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,090
埃托奥说得对
Eto'o is right.

185
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:23,010
没有了你  桑加拉就失去了领袖
Without you,Sangala has no leader.

186
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,068
人民需要你
The people need you.

187
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,094
还剩30秒
30 seconds.

188
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,015
埃托奥是不会被你吓倒的
Eto'o's courage is stronger than your threats.

189
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,025
他已准备牺牲
He is willing to die.

190
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:43,029
对他所做的牺牲  我将永世感怀
And for that sacrifice he has my eternal gratitude,

191
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,086
桑加拉的人民也会永远感激他
and the gratitude of the people of Sangala.

192
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,047
还剩10秒
Ten seconds.

193
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,041
时间到
Time's up.

194
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,065
15分钟前我还跟他通过话呢
I just got through to him 15 minutes ago.

195
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,036
但是他现在没接
Well, he's not answering now.

196
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,083
那就再打给住所的其他人
Then get me someone else at the residence.

197
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,044
是联调局
It's the FBI.

198
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,028
联调局知道我们在这
Does the FBI know we're here?

199
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,054
是坦纳告密了
Tanner.

200
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,061
只有他知道我们的计划
He's the only one who knew we were grabbing Matobo.

201
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:39,081
他肯定是招了
He must have talked.

202
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,054
长官  我们得在他们到达之前离开
Sir, we need to go before they get here.

203
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,098
不能留下马托波
Not without Matobo.

204
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,021
这些墙有两英尺厚
Those walls are two feet thick.

205
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,028
就算用聚能弹炸开一个洞
Even if we blow a hole with a shaped charge

206
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,035
里面的人也活不了
they'll kill everyone inside.

207
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,054
我找到办法了
I think I found a way.

208
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,015
是吗  什么
Yeah? Like what?

209
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,025
我们用毒气把他们逼出来
We can gas them out.

210
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,016
-我们没有毒气  -那就想办法弄来
- We don't have anything! - We'll find something!

211
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,046
有一个通风系统
There's a ventilation system

212
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,009
直通藏身处
running straight into the safe room.

213
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,016
如果能通气进去  就能把他们逼出来
If I can feed the gas through that, it'll flush 'em out.

214
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,059
联调局马上就来了
The FBI is coming!

215
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,040
他们15分钟之内到不了
They won't be here for at least 15 minutes.

216
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,090
你在说什么  你怎么知道
What are you talking about? How do you know?

217
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,033
若他们在我们到达之前就知道了
If they knew anything before we got here

218
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,067
他们会立刻转移马托波
they'd have evacuated Matobo.

219
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,097
那只是猜测
That's just guesswork.

220
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:08,064
战术小组已不在特区内
The tac teams are staged out of the DC branch office

221
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,084
他们离这有21里
That's 21 miles from here, with traffic.

222
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,091
我们至少有15分钟
That gives us at least 15 minutes.

223
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,008
我们不能留下马托波
We're not leaving without Matobo.

224
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,028
杜巴库雇我们就是为了这个
That's what Dubaku is paying us for.

225
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,008
-你该不会是真打算  -闭嘴
- You're not seriously considering... - Shut up!

226
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,088
你说的是哪种气体
What kind of gas are you talking about?

227
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,018
双硬脂铵
Ammonium dysterate.

228
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,005
从普通日用品中就能制备出来
We can make it from basic household products.

229
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:24,073
-就这么办  -托尼  帮我一把
- Do it. - Tony, give me a hand.

230
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,010
杰克  你知道如果用双硬脂铵
Jack, you do know ammonium dysterate could kill them

231
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:36,040
他们很可能在被逼出来之前就会死
as easily as flush them out.

232
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,087
我们必须赌一把
That's a chance we're gonna have to take.

233
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,080
运送马托波是我们唯一
Delivering Matobo is our only chance

234
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:42,068
接近杜巴库和CIP装置的机会
to get to Dubaku and the CIP device.

235
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:46,012
行了  拿上这些碗
I got it. Grab those bowls.

236
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,013
进入通风口了吗
Gotten into the vent yet?

237
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,013
是
Yeah!

238
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:30,053
联调局马上就到了
The FBI will be here any minute.

239
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,041
马托波先生
Mr. Matobo...

240
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:18,091
我们已控制藏身处的通风口
we've accessed the air intake to your safe room.

241
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:21,035
现在正释放双硬脂铵气体
We are now feeding in ammonium dysterate gas.

242
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:24,002
若不开门  你将必死无疑
If you do not open the door you will die.

243
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:28,019
我相信你愿意牺牲自己的生命
I believe that you are willing to sacrifice your life.

244
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,046
但是您愿意
But are you also willing

245
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:32,066
让您的妻子也因你而死吗
to sentence your wife to death?

246
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,006
乌勒
Ule...

247
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:45,054
你知道开门的后果
You know what they will do if we open the door.

248
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,071
我知道
I know.

249
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:53,001
我不能让他们逼我说出那些名字
I can't let them force me to name names.

250
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:57,002
国家的事业比我们重要的多
Our cause is more important than we are.

251
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,049
抓住我的手
Take my hand.

252
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,097
-詹尼斯·古德  -是我
- Janis Gold? - Yes?

253
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,027
我是雷蒙德·哈维尔
I'm Raymond Howell

254
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:20,051
来自司法部长办公室
from the Attorney General's office

255
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:21,094
我们到哪里谈谈
Is there some place we can talk?

256
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:24,085
-谈什么  -医院的事  古德小姐
- About?  - What happened at the hospital, Ms. Gold.

257
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,095
沃克探员被指控
Agent Walker's being accused

258
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,061
虐待嫌疑人
of torturing your suspect.

259
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:29,062
他不是我的嫌疑人  我不知道
He's not my suspect, I have no idea what happened

260
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,028
我离开房间之后发生了什么  跟我无关
after I left that room, I am not involved.

261
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:34,012
嫌疑人的律师称  你把他们
The suspect's attorneys claim that you sent them

262
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,036
引去了错误的病房
to the wrong hospital room

263
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,056
来给沃克探员争取更多时间
to buy Agent Walker more time.

264
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:39,043
在我看来  这跟你有关
So it sounds to me like you were involved.

265
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,086
你得等等
This is going to have to wait.

266
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,073
-詹尼斯  我需要你设置通信  -莫斯探员
Janis, I need you on comm, now. Agent Moss

267
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,020
-司法部长亲自对此立案调查  -哈维尔
- the A.G. personally initiated this investigation. - Howell

268
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,080
你自己看看  我们有紧急情况
open your eyes, we have a situation.

269
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,024
她现在不能处理此事
She cannot deal with this right now.

270
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,024
拜托
Please

271
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,037
坐一下  过来
have a seat. Come here.

272
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,074
怎么了
What's going on?

273
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:53,077
估计阿尔梅达一伙已到达马托波住所
We think Almeida and his crew may already at Matobo's.

274
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,041
我们联系不上蕾妮  无法通知她
And we can't reach Renee to warn her.

275
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,041
-为何联系不上  -我听说她的所作所为
- Why can't you reach her?  - When I heard what she did

276
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,015
我命令她回总部来
to Tanner, I ordered her back to headquarters

277
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,058
向司法部长办公室报告
to talk to the A.G's office

278
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,065
她拒绝了  还关掉了手机
and she, uh, refused, turned off her cell.

279
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,035
我要你布置特警组布点
I need you running point on SWAT.

280
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:06,052
好的  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

281
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:09,029
希林格  继续联络蕾妮
Hillinger, keep trying to reach Renee.

282
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:43,066
我们时间不多了
We're running out of time.

283
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,099
放更多的毒气进去
Put more gas in!

284
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,003
那样他们会马上送命的
If we do, it'll kill them instantly.

285
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,023
杰克  还要多久
How much time is it going to take, Jack?

286
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,050
这要看他们
It's up to them.

287
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,008
我没法呼吸
I can't breathe.

288
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:09,008
闭上眼睛  从容以对
Just close your eyes, let it happen.

289
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:14,092
如果打开门  后果更是不堪设想
I know if we open that door, it will be worse.

290
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:22,046
我爱你
I love you.

291
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,048
阿拉玛  不要
Alama, no!

292
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,011
快把他带出来
Get him out of there!

293
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:44,048
这女人也带走
Get the woman, too.

294
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,026
深呼吸  你不会有事的
Just breathe, you'll be all right.

295
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,076
呼吸
Just breathe.

296
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:55,043
好了  快撤
Okay, let's go!

297
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,093
我对不起你
I'm so sorry.

298
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:13,028
快点
Come on.

299
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,016
我是莫斯
It's Moss.

300
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,017
拉里  我是蕾妮
Larry, it's Renee.

301
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:34,040
蕾妮  听着
Renee, listen.

302
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,007
鲍尔和阿尔梅达可能已在马托波住处
Bauer and Almeida may already be at Matobo's.

303
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,077
的确  我看到他们
They are, I've got a visual on them

304
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,044
正把马托波夫妇装上卡车
loading Matobo and his wife into a truck.

305
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,031
-特警组跑哪里去了  -还有多久

306
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,068
还差五分钟
They're still about five minutes out.

307
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,024
蕾妮  退后
Renee, listen to me, I want you

308
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,025
等待特警组支援
to stand down and fallback until they get there.

309
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,031
你听到了吗
Do you hear me?

310
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,032
让我搞清楚车牌号
Let me just get a plate on the vehicle.

311
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:51,038
把枪放下
Drop the gun.

312
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,099
蕾妮
Renee?

313
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,026
蕾妮
Renee?

314
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,023

詹尼斯  再联系她

00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,003

爱默生先生
Mr. Emerson!

321
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:20,005
就我观察  她是一个人
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

322
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,018
该死的鲍尔  你个狗娘养的
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.

323
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,012
她是联调局的人
She's FBI.

324
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,019
她叫沃克  是她把我从参议院听证会里
Her name is Walker. She's the one that pulled me

325
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,023
弄出来寻找托尼
out of the Senate hearing to help find Tony.

326
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:33,056
别干傻事
Don't be stupid.

327
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,066
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

328
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,020
坦纳对你的计划了解多少
How much does Tanner know about your operation?

329
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
足够多了
Enough to cause problems.

330
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,000
我们要从她那里搞清楚
We need to find out from her what he

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,013
他对联调局说了多少  在此之前
told the FBI--  till then

332
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,014
-先留她活口  -大卫  他说得对
- we do nothing.  - He's right, David.

333
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:45,037
我们要弄清有没有其他消息泄露出去
We need to be sure nothing else has been compromised.

334
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,071
把她带上车
Get her in the cage.

335
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,071
别碰我
Don't you touch me.

336
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:56,055
-把你的手拿开  -闭嘴  不然
- Get your hands off of me!  - Shut up or I will

337
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,028
有你好看
shut you up.

338
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,066
她身上没武器
She's clean.

339
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,019
我们走
Let's go!

340
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,086
-抓到马托波了  -没错

341
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,046
还有他老婆  但我们
And the wife, but we ran

342
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,076
出了些岔子
into a complication.

343
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,009
什么岔子
A complication?

344
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,070
联调局已经知道了这次行动
FBI knew about the operation.

345
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,003
说明坦纳已经泄密了
Which means Tanner talked.

346
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,003
-这不是什么好消息  -我也不希望这样
- I don't like this. - No, neither do I.

347

我们抓到了他们的一个探员
We got one of their agents

348
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,044
她叫沃克
with us, her name's Walker.

00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,087
联络你在
I need you to check

350
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,021
局里的眼线
with your source at the Bureau,

351
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,057
看她知道多少
find out how much she knows.

352
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,048
-好的  -如果你的内线没查出什么
- All right. - If your source doesn't come up

353
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:58,011
我们到了以后再拷问她
with anything, we'll interrogate her when we get there.

354
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,062
我居然相信了你
Can't believe I trusted you.

355
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,002
你这个婊子养的骗子
You lying son of a bitch.

356
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,032
老哥  事关重大
This is important, man.

357
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:36,079
对他  对我都很重要
To him and me.

358
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,006
多谢  感激不尽

有何进展

360
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,046
有  先生
Yes, sir.

361
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,070
我很抱歉花了这么久
I'm sorry it took so long,

362
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,057
我有个朋友给在私人企业
but I tracked down a friend who does crypto

363
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,027
做解密业务  他说他可以
for the private sector-- he says he should

364
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,024
把U盘上的文件解密
be able to crack the files  on the thumb-drive.

365
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,074
只要不是军用或以上级别的加密手段
Provided the, uh, encryption isn't military grade or better.

366
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:54,011
我认为罗杰接触不到这些
I doubt Roger would have had access to anything like that.

367
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,008
他还说如果你找国安局帮忙
He also said you'd have a lot easier job

368
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:57,051
事情就容易多了
if you just went to the NSA.

369
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,012
我们得先搞清楚
Not until we know

370
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,075
我太太的内阁中有多少人已被收买
how badly my wife's administration's been compromised.

371
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,019
我朋友说20分钟后在他家见面
My friend said he'd meet us at his apartment in 20 minutes.

372
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,032
他能信得过吗
Do you trust him?

373
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,033
是的
Yes

374
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:10,042
萨曼莎说这些文件能证明
Samantha says the documents would prove

375
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,033
我儿子是被谋杀的
my son was murdered.

376
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,073
我会告诉他此事不可外泄
I'll make sure he understands this can't go anywhere.

377
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,063
谢谢你  布莱恩
Thank you, Brian.

378
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:23,004
你不了解我这些日子的感受
You don't know what it's been like.

379
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,044
一直以来  从骨子里  我就深信
All this time knowing in my bones

380
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,078
罗杰是不会自杀的
Roger didn't commit suicide

381
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,061
人们一直忍受着我这种想法
and having people just tolerate me

382
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,032
告诉我  我只是伤心才那么说
tell me it was my grief talking.

383
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:38,096
我一定要找到杀我儿子的凶手  布莱恩
I'm going to find the people who did this to my son Brian.

384
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:41,022
我要让他们血债血偿
And I am going to make them pay.

385
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,033
长官  请恕我多嘴
Sir if I may...

386
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,023
说吧
What is it?

387
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,073
你至少应该知会总统阁下
Shouldn't you at least tell the President

388
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:48,064
告诉她你的打算
what you're doing?

389
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,097
现在不能告诉她
I can't take this to my wife...

390
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,041
我得先确认此事不假
until I can prove it.

391
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,059
您要见我
You wanted to see me?

392
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,048
有件事我晓得
One thing I've learned:

393
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,009
总统交不到新朋友
presidents don't make new friends.

394
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,093
所以有事情他们会找老朋友
That's why they lean on their old ones.

395
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,006
我需要你的支持  伊桑
I'll need your support Ethan.

396
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:21,056
我要下令
I'm going to authorize

397
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:24,010
依计划开始对桑加拉的军事行动
the military operation in Sangala as planned.

398
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:25,084
总统阁下
Madame President...

399
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,057
你无需提醒我后果  伊桑
You don't need to list the consequences, Ethan.

400
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:29,074
我在西非做的任何行动
Any action I take in West Africa

401
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:32,078
都可能导致我们遭受恐怖袭击
will likely result in a terrorist attack here

402
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,058
但我若不采取行动  全桑加拉的人民
but if I take no action, an entire generation

403
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:38,038
将会被屠杀殆尽
of Sangalans will be wiped out.

404
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,088
舆论会指责
Your critics will point out

405
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,042
您宣誓保护本国人民
you took an oath to protect the people of  this  country.

406
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:44,005
正是为了达到这个目的
And the way to do that

407
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:47,057
我才不会向勒索与恐吓屈服
is not give in to blackmail and threats.

408
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,069
伊桑
Ethan...

409
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,096
抵抗桑加拉的屠杀暴政
taking a stand against the genocide in Sangala

410
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:57,047
已经使我们在世界上
has reestablished our leadership and our moral authority

411
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:58,070
重塑了领袖地位和道德权威
in the eyes of the world.

412
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:02,044
我不能  也不会退缩的
I cannot and I will not back down.

413
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:04,004
说
Yes?

414

-有要事相商  -叫他进来
- It's urgent. - Send him in.

417
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:13,005
出什么事情了  乔
What is it Joe?

418
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:14,015
联调局刚汇报说
The FBI just reported

419
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,062
总理马托波及其夫人
that Prime Minister Matobo and his wife

420
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,022
在他们的住处被绑架了

421
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:18,065
什么
What?!

422
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,029
被谁绑架的
Abducted by whom?

423
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,056
保镖辨认出了杰克·鲍尔和托尼·阿尔梅达

424
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:23,083
他们两人参与其中

425
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:26,087
杜巴库已同时拥有CIP装置和马托波
which means Dubaku has the CIP device and Matobo.

426
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,073
联调局的搜寻结果如何
Where is the FBI on finding him?

427
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,097
有线索么
Do they have any active leads?

428
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,014
还没有  总统阁下
Not yet Madame President.

429
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,074
他们刚开始搜寻工作
They're just beginning the search operation.

430
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,051
咱们得谈谈
I think we need to talk

431
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:39,002
马托波遭绑架对进军的影响
about how Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.

432
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:41,074
在进军之后  只有马托波有着广泛支持
Matobo is the only man with enough popular support

433
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:44,085
和实力去领导桑加拉
and strength to lead Sangala after an invasion.

434
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,072
没有他  国家将四分五裂
Without him,the country would collapse

435
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,035
陷入混乱之中
in complete bloodshed and chaos.

436
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,052
因此  如今的上策
Which means the best course of action may be

437
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:53,050
或是是满足杜巴库的要求  撤兵
to meet Dubaku's demand and withdraw our forces.

438
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:55,099
上策
The best course of action

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,034
是找到杜巴库和绑架他的人
is to find Matobo and the people who took him.

440
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:05,037
让联调局与各相关机构协调合作
And make sure the FBI brings in every relevant agency.

441
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,057
是的  阁下
Yes ma'am.

442
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:10,094
那么  关于进军
So... where do we stand with your decision

443
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:12,075
您到底想如何决定
to go through with the invasion?

444
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,011
离杜巴库的时限还有30分钟
We still have 30 minutes before Dubaku's deadline.

445
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:21,085
在此之前必须找到马托波
I want Matobo found by then.

446
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,065
我刚发给了你新搜查坐标
I just sent you new search coordinates.

447
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:26,006
请给外勤组上更新坐标

先前我发神经  很抱歉
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

没事的
It's cool.

00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,080
她已经在地面上了

00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:42,087
她的飞机降落了  幸运之极

457

当他们拿CIP装置杀死无辜的美国人后

只说了绑架马托波的细节

511
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,096
-你确定吗  -确定

512
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:20,034
沃克无足轻重
Walker is extraneous.

513
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,030

00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:34,056
有关行动的消息
that can compromise the operation.

520
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,039
你相信尼科尔斯的内线吗
You trust Nichols' source?

521
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,045
他相信
Nichols does.

522
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,038
这就够了
That's good enough for me.

523
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,088

00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,020
废弃的工地  我们把她抛尸于此

527
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:56,030
安全起见  应该先弄清楚她知道多少

尼科尔斯要我们先除掉她

529
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:01,028

我理解你们的已全力部署

531
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,090
但我们一名探员失踪了
but one of our own agents is missing.

532
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,021

533
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,018
听着  我不管你去哪找人手

好像火烧眉毛了
He looks like his head's going to explode.

537
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:40,085
谢谢
Thank you.

538
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,022
我倒不惊讶
Well, I'm not surprised.

539
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:43,065
什么意思

很明显  他很在乎蕾妮

541

为什么会这样想

我给总统的最后期限  马上就要到了

很显然  我们的警告不够分量
Apparently, our demonstration was not convincing enough.

549
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,031
这女人比我们想象的还要固执

550
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,086
一旦她发现我们抓住了马托波

551
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,047
她就会改变主意
she'll change her mind.

552
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:42,002
万一没有呢
And if she doesn't?

553
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:45,056

00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:56,019
马托波什么时候到

为什么晚了
What caused the delay?

560
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,020

等我的人把她除掉

他说没问题

你为我铤而走险

00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:47,090
等我们拿到U盘上的资料后 再谢我也不迟
You can thank me after we confirm the information is on that drive.

576
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,087
他说钥匙就在垫子下面

泰勒先生跑去她房间质问罗杰的事

00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:58,046
我真的很抱歉  先生
I really am sorry, sir.

615
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:02,019
不能让你孤单上路
If only you'd left well enough alone.

616
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:12,024
-罗斯小姐  -沃斯勒探员
- Ms. Roth.  - Agent Vossler.

617
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,037
亨利·泰勒先生派我过来
Henry Taylor sent me.

618
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,064
泰勒先生在调查
Mr. Taylor's been looking

619
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,094
你说的那件事情
into the matter you discussed.

620
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,094
他认为你现在有危险
He believes you're in imminent danger.

621
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:22,095
我的天
My God...

622
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:24,028
我该怎么办
What am I supposed to do?

623
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:25,045
他希望我
He wants me

624
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,078
把你送到一个地方保护起来
to place you in protective custody.

625
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:28,032
我送你到藏身处去
Escort you to a safe house.

626
00:33:28,032 --> 00:33:31,002
-现在吗  -我接到的命令是马上带你走
- Now? - My orders are to take you there immediately.

627
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:33,012
我们可以去一趟你的住所
We can stop at your apartment first

628
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,053
以便你准备些衣物
so you can pack clothes, essentials.

629
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,086
我得给办公室打个电话
Uh, I just need to call my office.

630
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:39,003
除非我们把你
Not until we get you

631
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,036
送到安全的地方  女士
locked down, ma'am.

632
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:45,050
请吧
Please.

633
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,097
好吧
Okay.

634
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:50,004
请这边走
This way, please.

635
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,096
司法部长派来的人还没走
So it looks like your friend from the A.G. is still here.

636
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:12,013
-我知道  -发生了什么事
- I know.  - What's going on?

637
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:13,043
他想知道蕾妮在医院里
He wants to talk to me about what Renee did

638
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:14,079
对坦纳做了什么
to Tanner in the hospital.

639
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,000
蕾妮对坦纳怎么了
What did Renee do to Tanner at the hospital?

640
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,027
我不知道  但哈维尔说她拷问过坦纳
I don't know, but Howell is claiming she tortured Tanner.

641
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:21,030
蕾妮
Renee?

642
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:22,084
我不信
I don't believe that.

643
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:24,067
由不得你不信
Maybe you should.

644
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:27,057
坦纳一开始什么都不说
Tanner wasn't talking...

645
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,008
然后她把我赶出了房间
and she kicked me out of the room.

646
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:30,041
接下来他的呼吸机
And then the next thing I know

647
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,058
警报装置被关闭
the alarm on his ventilator is going off.

648
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:34,036
蕾妮得到情报了吗
And Renee had the information she needed?

649
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,032
如果你当时不在场  你就不会有事
If you weren't in the room, you don't have a problem.

650
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:45,033
我在场  她让我去牵制他的律师
I do, actually-- she asked me to stall his lawyers.

651
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,089
你去了吗
And you did?

652
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,006
-是的  -你这是怎么了  古德
- Yes.  - Come on, Gold.

653
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,030
你想什么呢
What were you thinking?

654
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:51,026
她直接命令我  我有什么办法
She gave me a direct order-- what was I supposed to do?

655
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:52,053
拒绝
Say no.

656
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:55,084
你知不知道  如果他们证明蕾妮拷问过他
Do you realize if they prove that Renee tortured him

657
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:57,010
你就成了从犯
you're an accessory?

658
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,014
那时拉里也无法救你
And Larry is not gonna protect you.

659
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,034
我知道  希望一切结束后
I know. Let's just hope the A.G.

660
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:04,069
司法部长不会再不依不饶
will have moved on to something else when this is all over.

661
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,092
我回去工作了
I'm getting back to work.

662
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:18,056
莫斯探员
Agent Moss.

663
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,005
有何贵干
What do you want?

664
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,089
抱歉打扰你  不过
Forgive my interruption, but it's just been

665
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,073
我刚听说沃克探员失踪了
brought to my attention that Agent Walker is missing.

666
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:29,099
不错  她可能已经被绑架
Yes, she may have been abducted

667
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,046
正是那些人
by the same people responsible

668
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:34,067
绑架了马托波夫妇
for kidnapping Matobo and his wife.

669
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:37,040
我很遗憾
I'm very sorry to hear that.

670
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,020
我了解你和联调局
And want you to know that I appreciate

671
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:41,034
正顶着巨大压力
the enormous pressure that you and the Bureau are under.

672
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:42,011
谢谢
Glad to hear it.

673
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:43,098
不过司法部长依旧要求
Nevertheless, the Attorney General is still pressing

674
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,054
调查沃克探员对坦纳的
for a full account of Agent Walker's handling

675
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:49,001
审讯手段  当前形势下
of the Tanner interrogation, and at this moment,

676
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:51,068
詹尼斯·古德是唯一有空的证人
Janis Gold is the only witness available to me.

677
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:53,005
她没空  哈维尔
She's not available to you, Howell.

678
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:55,052
我说过她现在无法抽身
I already told you, she can't be spared right now.

679
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,009
我只需和她说几句话
I only need a short time with her.

680
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,026
不能把她交给你
You can't have her.

681
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:00,003
别逼我给司法部长打电话
Are you going to force me to get the A.G. on the line?

682
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,049
你不是开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

683
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,016
你非要现在逼我吗
You really want to press this right now?!

684
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:05,056
我们身陷国际争端之中
We're in the middle of an international crisis.

685
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,033
这我了解
I'm aware of that.

686
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,063
而你关心的只是
And all you seem interested in is

687
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,020
谴责一位生死不明探员的行为
condemning the actions of an agent who's in God-knows-what

688
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,087
然后把她绳之于法
danger just so you can nail her to the wall.

689
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:14,027
倘若沃克探员有违联邦条例
If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines and used

690
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:15,091
用非法手段获取情报
illegal tactics to get information,

691
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,074
那么不错  她会受到制裁
then, yes, she will be prosecuted.

692
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,044
那就请你让我们先把她找回来
Then maybe you can let us get her back first

693
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:20,094
再由你送入虎口
before you throw her to the wolves,

694
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,032
劳您大驾
I mean, if that's okay with you.

695
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,025
什么事
Yes?

696
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:31,009
拉里  国安局截获一通电话  刚传给我们
Larry? NSA just relayed a call they intercepted to us.

697
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,076
里面提到了蕾妮
Renee was referenced.

698
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:34,060
提到了什么
Referenced how?

699
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:36,059
詹尼斯
Janis?

700
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,000
你还是过来亲自听吧
I think you need to come hear it yourself.

701
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:41,010
我这就去
I'll be right there.

702
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,023
失陪
Excuse me.

703
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:43,040
我们还没说完
We're not done here.

704
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:46,024
莫斯探员
Agent Moss!

705
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:49,004
查到信息源头了吗
Did you source it?

706
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:50,031
五分钟前
Five minutes ago.

707
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,011
核实无误
It's legit.

708
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,028
再查一次
Check it again.

709
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:54,039
已经查过两次了
I already did, twice.

710
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,069
拦截代码在哪里
Where's the intercept code?

711
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,079
就在解密算法之上
Right there above the decryption algorithm.

712
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,083
通过优先频道传给了我们
They routed it to us on a priority channel.

713
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,019
是否得到了口头确认
Were we able to get verbal confirmation?

714
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,030
那也无法改变谈话内容  詹尼斯
It's not going to change the content of the call, Janis.

715
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,080
我知道  我只是
I know, I just...

716
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,054
国安局截获了什么录音
What's on the NSA intercept?

717
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,030
你说提到过蕾妮  是什么事
What? You said Renee was referenced. What's on it?

718
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,097
只有一个片段  但提到了她
It's only a fragment, but she's referenced, yeah.

719
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,034
能以此定位对方吗
Enough to get a GPS fix?

720
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:14,091
片段不到20秒长
The clip's not even 20 seconds long.

721
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:17,078
只能断定在市内
The best we can say is that it's in the Metro area.

722
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,029
播放
Play it.

723
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:23,045
爱默生  你说得对
Emerson, you were right,

724
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,062
沃克探员让坦纳招供了
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

725
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:27,025
坦纳说了多少
How much did Tanner spill?

726
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:30,019
只有绑架马托波的具体细节
Other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing.

727
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,029
你确定吗
You're sure?

728
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,079
沃克无足轻重
Walker is extraneous.

729
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,070
来之前干掉她
Kill her before you get here.

730
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,003
我们很快就到
We'll be with you soon.

731
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,057
动作要快
Be quick about it.

732
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:41,051
杜巴库急于见到总理
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the Prime Minister.

733
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,091
这是何时的电话
When was this call made?

734
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,078
十分钟前
Ten minutes ago.

735
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,041
追查来源
Run a trace.

736
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,005
查过了
I already did.

737
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,036
再查一次
Run it again!

738
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,031
杰克
Jack.

739
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,005
那儿有个坑
The ditch.

740
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,046
干掉她
Kill her.

741
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:30,073
嗯
Yeah.

742
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,066
托尼
Tony.

743
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:52,028
下来
Step down.

744
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:54,035
下来
Step down!

745
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:03,002
自己走  还是我拽你走
You could either walk or I could drag you.

746
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,003
你真要杀我吗
You're really going to kill me?

747
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:15,054
我不会求饶
I'm not going to beg for my life, Jack.

748
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:31,064
你对我说的都是谎言吗
So everything that you told me was a lie?

749
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:33,038
我也是身不由己
I'm doing what I have to.

750
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,015
我也不期望你能理解我
I don't expect you to understand.

751
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:39,045
我只知道你是叛徒  刽子手
I understand that you are a traitor and a murderer.

752
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,099
转身
Turn around.

753
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,036
不
No.

754
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:47,009
我要你看着我开枪
You're going to have to look at me when you pull that trigger.

755
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,093
我让你转身
I said turn around.

756
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,097
信我的话  我保你不死
If you trust me, I will get you through this alive.

757
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:53,064
跪下
Get on your knees.

758
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:41,098
我刚才还以为你不会下手
For a second there, I didn't think you were going to do it.

759
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,005
埋了她
Now bury her.

760
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,072
我们时间紧迫
We're on a timetable.

761
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:46,089
出境之前
Can't have anyone finding the body

762
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,022
不能让别人找到尸体
before we're out of the country.

763
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:51,010
帮我个忙  托尼
Give him a hand, Tony.
