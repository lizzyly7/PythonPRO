那你告诉她  她女儿不想再等了

56
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,076
还是去跟她说一声为好

57
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:07,047
总统有令  让你继续留在白宫

58
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,027
那么如果我想走

59
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,057
你会对我施行人身限制吗
You will actually physically restrain me?

60
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,041
不会那样的  泰勒女士
Oh, that would never happen, ms. taylor,

61
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,094
因为我知道你对你母亲

62
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,055
还有她的工作给予了足够的尊敬

绝不会做得太离谱

你母亲让我告诉你发生了什么事

69
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,091
恕我直言  伊桑
Well, with all due respect, ethan,

70
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:48,001
她派你来传话是大错特错了
You're the last person she should be sending.

71
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:51,015
城内将会有另外一起恐怖袭击事件
There's about to be another terrorist attack on this city.

72
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,022
所以她才让你继续留在这里
That's why she wants you to remain here.

73
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,048
你是说会有更多飞机会失事
Are we talking about more planes going down?

74
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,092
还不清楚
We don't know.

但是不管会发生什么  都已是迫在眉睫了

77
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:03,063
最重要的是
On top of all of this,

78
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,096
还有一个进兵计划需要处理
There's also the invasion to deal with.

79
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,070
所以  记住
So, bear in mind,

80
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:11,063
你母亲正面临巨大的压力
Your mother's under tremendous pressure right now.

81
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,091
媒体知晓安全措施加强之事
It's only a matter of time before the media picks up

82
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,007
只是个时间问题
On the heightened security measures.

83
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,051
我要在他们知晓之前
I want to issue a statement

84
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,068
发布一个声明
Before that happens.

85
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,048
对袭击的现实可能性进行淡化处理
Play down the actual likelihood of an attack,

86
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,041
告知媒体安全措施
Talk about the security measures

87
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,035
只是出于必要的考虑  而避免谈及...
as being due diligence, rather than...

88
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,058
不  梅瑞狄斯
No, meredith.

89
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,088
公众有权了解实情
The public deserves the truth.

90
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,028
我们需要强调谨慎和冷静
We stress caution and calm,

91
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,092
但是我们必须承认情报显示

敌人已占领了这个楼面

我女儿不来不许你关门

我们遇到袭击  别无选择

反正我们也无法到达了  杰克

杰克  听得到吗

320
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,070
亚伦  我是杰克  听得到吗
Aaron, it's Jack. Do you copy?

321
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,037
妈的  朱玛切断了我们的联系
Damn it. Juma's cut off our communication.

322
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:13,044
我必须确认我女儿的安全
I need to know that my daughter's safe.

323
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,024
总统阁下  我还无法确保这点

324
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,075
安博

敌众我寡  实力悬殊

333
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,047
探员们知不知道 总统在安全屋里

334
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,047
唯一一个看见的人已经死了

立即撤退  否则我就杀了她

我需要确认总统在你手上  才能下令撤退

343
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,076

把你的人撤出白宫
Move your men out of the building

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,033
撤出警戒线  不然我就杀了总统

346
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,047
而且她的死会算在你头上

347

359
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,043
特勤局撤退的唯一原因
The only reason secret service would retreat

360
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,030
是他们以为总统在他们手上
is if they thought juma had the president.

361
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:54,014
但是鲍尔说他已经把我妈送进安全屋了
But that man, Bauer, said he got  my mother into the lockdown.

362
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,000
朱玛在虚张声势

让大家知道这里的情况并夺回白宫

00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,087
要是霍奇给我们的说明书没错的话
Assuming the specifications hodges gave us are correct.

我们在一层的一个走廊里和他们正面交火

那时  朱玛让我们撤退

他的人在屠杀平民和探员们

你没跟我说杰克在白宫

00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:38,019
该死
Damn it.

453
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:46,043
总统阁下  把插头插进去
Madam president, plug the cord into the wall, please.

454
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:47,099
快点
Now.

455
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:58,034
好了
Okay.

456
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,088
将军
General.

457
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,078
怎么了
What's wrong?

458
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,082
突然坏了
It just went dead.

459
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,039
他们肯定是从里面把线路搞短路了
Somehow, they must have disabled the circuitry from inside.

460
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:19,006
我们用C4炸弹炸开门
Then, we'll use c4 to blow open the door.

461
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,013
我们必须要在11个锁眼都打洞
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of the 11 locking rods.

462
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,016
太费时间了
It will take too long.

463
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,057
这得看钢筋有多坚固
Depending on how the steel is hardened,

464
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:27,023
C4炸药可能都不管用
C4 might not even work.

465
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,007
车到山前必有路
Then we'll find another way.

466
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,022
不可否认的是
There can be no room for doubt.

467
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:51,032
总统已成困兽
We have the president trapped.

468
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,040
只要我们打开那扇门  就可以名垂青史了
We open up that door, we become a part of history.

469
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:58,013
车到山前必有路
We will find another way.

470
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,099
请讲
Yes.

471
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,092
等一下
Just a moment.

472
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:28,096
有您的专线电话
Call came in on the dedicated uplink.

473
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,026
我听到了
I heard it.

474
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,000
是他  长官
It's him, sir.

475
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,067
开到免提
Put him on speaker.

476
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:45,048
将军  没想到会和你直接通话
General, didn't expect to be hearing from you directly.

477
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,015
我可以为你做些什么
What is it i can do for you?

478
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,065
我们有一个麻烦
We have a problem.

479
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:51,062
总统在安全屋里
The president is secured in the lockdown.

480
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,069
在下早有所料
Well, we prepared you for that possibility.

481
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:55,096
我把那个安全屋的设施说明书给你了
We gave you the specs for the locking mechanism.

482
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,066
他们在里面把控制面板短路了
They shorted the lock out from the inside.

483
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:01,059
请你再帮我找一个进去的方法
I need you to find me another way in.

484
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:04,010
将军  我已倾囊相助了
General, I've given you everything i have to give.

485
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,080
我的使命已经完成了
My part in this thing is over.

486
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:16,078
你忘记了你货物还没有到手吧
Are you forgetting that you don't have the shipment yet?

487
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:20,015
将军  我希望你言而有信
Now, general, I expect you to be an honorable man.

488
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,018
我们有约在先
We made a deal.

489
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,082
我遵守了我的承诺
We held up our end of the bargain.

490
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,025
把你弄进了白宫
We got you in the white house.

491
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:26,005
我希望你也能信守你的承诺
I expect you to hold up yours.

492
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:27,085
我对你的期望不感兴趣
I don't care about your expectations.

493
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:30,069
你不帮我的话  我就在货到你那里之前
You help me, or i will destroy that shipment

494
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:32,059
把它销毁
Before it ever arrives to you.

495
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,013
等会
Hang on.

496
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,083
好吧
Well...

497
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,083
西顿  你怎么想
Seaton, what do you think?

498
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,047
他真的做得出来吗
Can he do what he says?

499
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:45,007
两小时内船都不会靠岸
The shipment's not due in the port for another two hours.

500
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:48,058
他的人有的是时间 毁了它   让它报废
His men will have plenty of time to destroy it, render it useless.

501
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,062
将军
General?

502
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:01,095
告诉我  安全屋里还有谁
Tell me-- who else is in the lockdown with the president?

503
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:05,012
我的人看到她和另一个人进去了
My men saw her enter with another man.

504
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,043
我在看白宫的人员清单
Well, i'm looking at the white house manifest,

505
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,026
上面说  奥利维亚·泰勒
And according to this, olivia taylor

506
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,090
现在正在你那边
Is presently in the building with you.

507
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:16,030
总统的女儿
The president's daughter?

508
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,027
你确定
Are you sure?

509
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,041
这个系统自动记录进出人员
Their system logs everyone in and out electronically.

510
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:22,048
如果上面说她在的话  她一定在
If it says that she's in there, she's in there.

511
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,021
把她找到
Now, you find olivia taylor,

512
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:27,028
你就可以威胁总统开门了
And you'll get the president to open that door.

513
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,065
你的船会如期到达的
Your shipment will arrive as planned.

514
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,052
谢谢
Thank you.

515
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,096
看见了吗  压力
There, you see-- stress.

516
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,016
压力
Stress...

517
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:42,060
才是创造力之本
Is the fertilizer of creativity.

518
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,080
还是玩会飞镖吧
Let's play some darts.

519
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,067
总统的女儿就在白宫
The president's daughter is somewhere in the white house.

520
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,037
我们去找到她
Let's find her.

521
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,035
抬起头来
Raise your heads.

522
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,025
让我看到你们的脸
Show me your faces.

523
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,000
你觉得发生什么事了
What do you think's going on?

524
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,054
我问你话呢
I asked you a question,

525
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,010
布坎南先生
Mr. buchanan.

526
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:30,038
你是不是觉得我惩罚鲍尔错了
You think I made the wrong call with bauer.

527
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:32,055
你觉得我要是甩手不管
You think that if I'd signed off

528
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,025
他逼供莱恩·伯内特的事
On him torturing ryan burnett,

529
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,085
一切就都可以避免了吗
All of this could have been avoided?

530
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,025
参议员  你根本不知道我在想什么
You don't know what i'm thinking, senator.

531
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,083
她不在这
She's not here.

532
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:54,053
快去把她找出来  带她来见我
Go ahead and find her and bring her to me.

533
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,076
怎么了
What happened?

534
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,023
-你看到什么了  -那扇门有警卫看守
- What did you see? - The door's guarded.

535
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:22,093
肯定有别的出路
Well, there's got to be another way out.

536
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,006
这边只有三个出口
There are only three exits

537
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,050
但是全有人把守
To this wing, and they're all covered.

538
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:27,054
窗户全是加固封锁的  根本打不破
The windows are sealed and hardened. Unbreakable.

539
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:28,090
我必须让他们知道
We have to let them know

540
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:31,004
恐怖分子在虚张声势   我妈不在他们手中
The terrorists are bluffing; that they don't have my mother.

541
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,051
我们只能往外发信号
Our only option is to get a signal out.

542
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:34,094
我们可以往窗外
We can do it from the windows

543
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,058
-发信号  -好的  好的
- Of the residence. - Okay, okay, good.

544
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,075
如果我把你留在安全地带会更好点
You'll be safer if I leave you in a secure area.

545
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,005
我发好信号就会回来找你
I'll get the signal out and come back for you.

546
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,055
我不会躲在该死的通风口的  皮尔斯探员
I'm not gonna sit and hide in some damn vent, agent pierce.

547
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,092
女士  路途遥远
Ma'am, it is a long way,

548
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,089
我们可能会遭遇更多敌人
And we're probably gonna encounter more of juma's men.

549
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,006
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

550
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:50,032
我不管
I don't care.

551
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,079
我跟着你  别争执了
I'm going with you, and don't try to argue.

552
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,043
没时间了
We don't have the time.

553
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:56,080
好吧
Okay.

554
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,046
跟在我后面
Stay behind me.

555
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:16,028
莫斯探员  红外卫星扫描已经就绪
Agent moss, sat-scan's all set up here.

556
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,025
我们能看到一群人质  但无法分辨个体
We can see the cluster of hostages, but not the individual bodies.

557
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,000
能更进一步吗  让图像更清晰点
That the best they can do? They can't boost the resolution on this?

558
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,075
不行  长官  白宫是世界上
no, sir. The white house is one of the most

559
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:26,024
防护最好的建筑物
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

560
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,062
收到
Yeah, got it.

561
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,009
-副总统已经接通  可以通话了  -多谢
- The vice president's ready. They're initiating communication.  - thanks.

562
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,090
大家出去下
Give us the room.

563
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,081
你在和副总统通话
You're on with the vice president.

564
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:51,014
副总统阁下  我是莫斯探员
Mr. vice president, i'm special agent moss,

565
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:53,005
联邦调查局首府分部的主管
Head of the fbi's dc branch.

566
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,081
这是沃克探员
This is agent walker.

567
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:56,082
我收到通报了
I've been briefed on the general situation.

568
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,058
最新情况是什么
What are the latest facts on the ground?

569
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:00,025
没有朱玛的进一步消息
There's nothing further from general juma,

570
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,069
但红外扫描显示
But an infrared scan of the building

571
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:03,086
他把人质集中到
Shows he's holding the hostages in a hallway

572
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,032
罗斯福厅外的走廊来
Outside the roosevelt room.

573
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,033
对于总统来讲是个好消息
Now this is very possibly good news for the president.

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,056
解释下
Explain.

575
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:12,033
那个区域易攻难守
The area's not one of the more defensible places in the building.

576
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,037
战术上讲  朱玛不应该选那作为阵地
Tactically, it makes no sense for juma to have chosen it as a base.

577
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:18,094
但那地方临近安全屋
However, the area is adjacent to the ground floor lockdown,

578
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,017
我们知道那是总统的必经之路
Which we know the president was en route to.

579
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,094
你觉得总统在里面了
So, you think the president made it into the lockdown?

580
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,058
这是最合理的解释
That's our best explanation for him being there.

581
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,068
所以我们请求您
We're therefore are asking you to authorize

582
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:31,062
在朱玛攻破安全屋前  下达营救命令
The rescue operation before juma manages to penetrate the lockdown.

583
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,013
还有别的证据表明
Do you have any other evidence that supports your theory

584
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,013
总统在安全屋里面吗
That the president is in the lockdown?

585
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,016
他曾被要求出示总统被控制的证据
There's the fact that he couldn't produce the president

586
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:47,023
但他没能做到
When we asked him to prove that he had her.

587
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,070
不能还是不愿意
Couldn't or wouldn't?

588
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,040
你也不能确定  是吗
You can't be certain which one it is, can you?

589
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,021
我们确实无法断定  阁下
Certainty's not possible in this case, sir.

590
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,054
但这是最好的判断
We're giving you our best estimation

591
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,074
我们请求您批准行动
And we urge you to allow us to launch.

592
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,071
如果你错了呢
What if you're wrong?

593
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,031
如果朱玛控制了总统呢
What if juma does have the president?

594
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,015
如果你攻击  他会立即杀了总统的
He will kill her as soon as he realizes what you're doing.

595
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:05,055
不行动也是有风险的  阁下
Inaction has its own risks, too, sir.

596
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,089
如果朱玛有更多的时间来加强防卫
The more time juma has to reinforce his position,

597
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:10,056
攻占白宫和营救人质会变得更加困难
The more difficult it'll be to take the building and save lives

598
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:12,073
我明白
I understand.

599
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,006
但首要考虑的是总统的性命
But my priority must be the president's life.

600
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,097
没有更多总统的情况前
Prudence dictates that i hold off on authorizing the rescue operation

601
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,000
我要谨慎从事
Until we can be more certain of her status.

602
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:22,037
副总统阁下
Mr. vice president,

603
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:24,040
恐怖分子控制了白宫

604
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:28,071
我想问您谨慎是合理的反应吗
I would ask you to consider if prudence is the appropriate response in this situation.

605
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:32,098
沃克探员  我感谢你的建议

606

除非你能提供里面更多的情况
Until you can provide me with more intel on what's going on in there,

607
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:42,009
否则你绝不能轻举妄动

及时向我通报最新情况

609
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:51,013
他就只管自己的前途

610

他是副总统

现在他说了算

00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,030
您的决定是英明的  阁下
It was the right call, sir.

613
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:00,091
您没法下达一个置总统于死地
You can't order an operation that results in the president's death

614
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:02,037
而自己却平步青云的命令

615
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:03,094
这在政治上是不可接受的
It would be politically untenable.

616
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:09,022
别再这样说了  德里克
Never let anyone hear you talking like that, derek.

617

天哪

620
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,061
我的天  亚伦
Oh, my god, aaron!

621
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,031
他们会听到枪声
They would've heard those shots,

622
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,068
你必须在他们来之前发出信号

有急救设备和手电筒

把手伸过来
Give me your hand.

630
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,094
这是"绿色代码"
This is called "code green."

631
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,080
一点表明短闪烁  一横表示长闪烁
A dot is a short blink; a dash is a long one.

632
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:08,074
"绿色代码"就是暗示  让他们行动
"code green" will signal them to move in.

633
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:10,018
快去
