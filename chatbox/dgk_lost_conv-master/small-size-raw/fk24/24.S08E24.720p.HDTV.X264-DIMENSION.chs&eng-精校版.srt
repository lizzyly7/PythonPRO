来见证这个伟大的时刻  我们不能忘记

5
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,020
我们仍沉浸在
that we all stand in the shadow

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,094
奥马·哈桑悲壮牺牲的哀伤中
of Omar Hassan's tragic death.

7
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,014
然而
But...

8
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:29,047
我们即将签署的和平协议
the peace agreement we're about to sign

9
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:32,087
是对他的纪念

他的胆识成就了我们今天历史性的一刻
His courage brought us all to this historic day,

11
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,010
他对未来的愿景

将继续指引我们大家  向着未来

共同前进

14
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,043
在此我谨代表俄罗斯人民

00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:50,095
伸出友好的手  欢迎我们的和谈伙伴
I extend the open hand of friendship to my partners in peace:

16
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,051
泰勒总统
President Taylor,

17
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,060
及哈桑总统
President Hassan.

18
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,028
感谢大家

00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:02,018
签署仪式结束后会有答记者问时间

20
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:03,031
请稍安勿躁

21
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,090
要是没有其它事情的话
If there's nothing more,

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,062
我们签署仪式上见
I will see you both at the signing.

23
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,089
看上去不只我一人不想待在这啊
It appears I am not the only one who does not want to be here.

24
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,069
哈桑夫人已心力交瘁
Mrs. Hassan is distraught.

25
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:22,024
可以理解  他丈夫六小时之前刚刚被害
Understandably-- her husband was killed six hours ago.

26
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,028
就因为这个她才不想正视我吗
Is that why she refuses to look at me?

27
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,010
她知道了
She knows.

28
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,027
有一个记者告诉她是你们密谋
A reporter told her of your complicity

29
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,067
杀害了她丈夫
in her husband's murder.

30
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,054
达莉亚就来找我了
Dalia came to me.

31
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:41,065
而你承认了这个记者所述的
And you confirmed this journalist's allegations.

32
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,032
我告诉了她真相
I told her the truth.

33
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,017
既然都知道了  她怎么还在这
And yet, knowing what she knows, she's still here.

34
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:53,060
哈桑夫人理解和平协议的意义
Mrs. Hassan understands the benefits of peace.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,086
少不了你的煽风点火吧
Because you helped her come to that understanding.

36
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:58,039
抱歉打扰了  总统阁下
Excuse me, Madam President.

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,059
阁下  有您的电话

38
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:06,094
无论你对哈桑夫人说了什么使她留下
Whatever it was you said to Mrs. Hassan to keep her here

39
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:10,043
那一定非常有说服力
must have been very convincing.

40
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,037
去接电话吧  尤里
Take your call, Yuri.

41
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,021
阁下  是查尔斯·罗根

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,061
罗根说了他想要什么吗

43
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,066
他只说很紧急

44
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,061
给我吧 [俄语]

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,011
查尔斯
Charles.

46
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,057
尤里  我们得谈谈
Yuri. We need to talk.

47
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,029
那就谈吧
So talk.

48
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,039
这事挺敏感的
Uh, it's a sensitive matter;

49
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,056
不太方便在电话里谈
something that, uh, that can't be discussed on the phone.

50
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,048
好吧
All right.

51
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,053
来我套房吧
Come to my suite.

52
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,025
不行  你得来我这
No. You need to come to mine.

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,085
相信我就是了  尤里
Just trust me, Yuri.

54
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,016
相信你
Trust you?

55
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,036
不用我提醒吧
I don't need to remind you

56
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,017
保证某些秘密不被泄露
that it is in our mutual self-interest

57
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,060
对你我都有好处
to make sure that certain secrets stay secret.

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,039
查尔斯  别再跟我拐弯抹角了
Stop talking in riddles, Charles.

59
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,057
我没时间跟你玩
I don't have time for this.

60
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,092
你的阵营里可能有人泄密
There's a possible leak inside of your camp,

61
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:07,096
所以我们才必须在我办公室谈
which is why we need to discuss this in my office.

62
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,080
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

63
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,018
我希望你满意我的演技
I hope I was convincing enough for you.

64
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,015
你可是世界顶级撒谎高手
You're a world-class liar;

65
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:23,022
我非常满意
I would have expected nothing else.

66
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:29,074
你觉得杀了萨瓦洛夫到底能怎样
What exactly do you think you're doing by killing Suvarov?

67
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,095
为蕾妮·沃克讨回公道吗
Getting justice for Renee Walker?

68
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,044
对  也为了所有在今天因为保护这个国家
Yes, and for all the other people that died today

69
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:34,083
而牺牲的人们
trying to protect this country.

70
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,030
现在给我坐到桌子那并保持连线
Now, sit at the desk and keep the line open.

71
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,095
杰克  你录的音频文件
Jack, the audio file you recorded--

72
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,023
我们可以用来揭穿萨瓦洛夫
we can use it to expose Suvarov.

73
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,062
我们可以用反恐小组的服务器
We can use the CTU servers

74
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:48,013
把它散布到所有政府机构及媒体那里
to distribute it to every government agency and media outlet.

75
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,025
泰勒总统已经封住了媒体的嘴
President Taylor's already censored the press.

76
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,093
国家安全局也建立了防火墙
NSA's putting up firewalls.

77
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:53,046
阿洛正忙着突破防火墙呢
Arlo's working on getting through them right now.

78
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:55,076
总统无法限制住所有媒体
The president can't lock down every media outlet.

79
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,032
是科尔
That's Cole.

80
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:01,016
要是我不接的话  他会派战术小队过来
If I don't answer that, he's sending a TAC team in here.

81
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,084
那样也来不及了
It'll be too late.

82
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:04,092
我马上就可以了结这件事了
I'm gonna finish what I've started.

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,049
已确定

92

杰克  放下你的枪

103
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,025
趁他们还没到让我带你出去
and let me walk you out of here before they get here.

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,034
杀掉帕维尔和诺瓦科维奇是一码事
Killing Pavel and Novakovich was one thing,

105
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,087
但是杀掉萨瓦洛夫呢
but killing Suvarov?

106
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,003
俄罗斯人会把自己总统在美国本土遇刺
The Russians will consider an assassination of their president

107
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:13,092
视为挑起战争的信号

108

是他协助了对我国的恐怖袭击

109
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:18,091
是他挑起了战争  他才是元凶

110
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,005
你正挑起与一个拥有武器装备国家的战争
You're provoking a war with a nuclear-armed country.

111
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,003
闭嘴  克罗伊
Shut up, Chloe!

112
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:23,082
不然怎样  你连我一起杀掉吗
Or what? You're gonna kill me, too?

113
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,021
必须得阻止他们
These people need to be stopped.

114
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:29,033

115
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,051
这是他们自食其果

116
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:33,007
我无需提醒你  你所造成的连带损害
I don't need to remind you of the collateral damage you're causing.

117
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,057
更不用提那些无辜的生命还危在旦夕
Not to mention the innocent lives that are at stake.

118
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,048
阁下  萨瓦洛夫总统在外面等候了
Sir, uh, President Suvarov is outside.

119
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:44,088
他说您在等他
He says you're expecting him.

120
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,027
阁下  您在听吗
Excuse me, sir?

121
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:53,046
是的
Yes.

122
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,036
让他进来吧
Send him in.

123
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,095
你要因为一个人的死而引发一场战争吗
You're gonna start a war because you lost someone?

124
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,036
重点不是因为我
This isn't about me.

125
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,042
若是蕾妮  她也不会希望你这么做
Renee wouldn't want you to do this.

126
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,077
我叫你闭嘴  克罗伊
I said shut up, Chloe!

127
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,093
你知道她不愿看到这事发生
You know she wouldn't.

128
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:12,045
若是她  她也会让你用那张记忆卡来伸张正义
She would want you to use that data card to get justice.

129
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:16,040
蕾妮最不希望你以她的名义来引发战争
The last thing Renee would want is for you to start a war in her name.

130
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:18,094
杰克  求你了  
Jack, please,

131
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:22,036
不要让她的名誉受损了
don't dishonor her memory like this.

132
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,014
我们俩要单独聊聊
We should speak alone.

133
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:26,000
当然
Yes, of course.

134
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,069
你说的那个泄漏情报的人...
This person, the one you say is leaking information...

135
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,034
是谁
who is it?

136
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,061
我在和你说话
I'm talking to you.

137
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,032
好吧  按你说的做
Okay, we'll do it your way.

138
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,018
但你要向我保证  你会把这件事了结了
But you got to promise me you'll see this through.

139
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,031
因为我没法活着走出这栋楼
Because there's no way I'm getting out of this building alive.

140
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,058
-杰克  -你要向我保证
- Jack...  - You got to promise me that

141
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,098
你会把这件事了结了
you will see this through

142
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:04,026
并完全按照我说的去做
and that you will do exactly what I say.

143
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,049
你得向我亲口保证
I need to hear it!

144
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,059
我保证
I promise.

145
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,006
我...
I'm, uh...

146
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:18,053
我很抱歉  这么急着打给您
I'm sorry... for calling you so urgently.

147
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:19,098
我搞错了
I was, uh, mistaken.

148
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,064
我的担心似乎没有什么根据
My concern appeared to have been unfounded.

149
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:28,074
不久前  我刚接到我的线人电话
I-I got a call from my source just a moment ago.

150
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,010
他的情报有误
His information was wrong.

151
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,048
很抱歉浪费了您的时间  尤里
I'm so sorry for wasting your time, Yuri.

152
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:37,079
格雷戈尔  瓦西里

你连这幢楼都出不去

160

你和科尔瞒着反恐小组找到我在先

163

对我格杀勿论

164
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,070
如果你不开枪打我

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,069
那文件哪都去不了
that file's not going anywhere.

指向我

他们进门时
And when they come through the door,

170

你告诉他们你在狙击枪旁发现了我  
you tell them you found me at the sniper rifle,

171
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,003
我袭击你  接着你开枪
I turned on you, and you opened fire.

172
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,068
别逼我做我办不到的事
Don't ask me to do something I can't do.

173
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,091
见鬼  克罗伊  扣动扳机
Damn it, Chloe, pull the trigger!

174
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,029

你说过会按照我说的办
You said you'd do exactly what I would say,

177
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:40,006
你说过会坚持到底

178
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:42,046
-我做不到  -不  你做得到

-扣动扳机  -不

We are running out of time! Pull the trigger!

184
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,005
别逼我
Please don't make me do this.

185
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,035
克罗伊  我知道这让你很为难
Chloe, I know how hard this is for you,

186
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,042
但如果你真的在乎我  你就会扣动扳机
but if you care about me at all, you will pull the trigger.

187
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,073
-快  -抱歉  我办不到
- Do it! - I'm sorry, I can't.

188
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,094
克罗伊  快扣扳机  
Chloe,  pull the trigger!

189
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,094
-不  杰克  -快扣扳机
- No, Jack! - Pull the trigger!

190
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,077
-我办不到  -见鬼
- I'm not gonna do it! - Damn you!

191
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,071
-怎么回事  -他掏出了武器
- What happened?  - He drew his weapon.

192
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,076
我先击中了他

194
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060

195
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,017
重复一遍  鲍尔中枪了
I repeat, Bauer is down.

196
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,009
克罗伊  我一直试着打你电话

杰克把它交给我了

既然他交给你了  为什么还要开枪打他

稍后回了反恐小组再说吧

我清楚这是一次严峻的考验  总统阁下
I'm sure it was a terrible ordeal, Mr. President.

238
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,002
但他们告诉我  杰克中枪了
But they told me Bauer's down.

239
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,003
-一切都过去了  -不  还没有
- It's over. - No. No.

240

还没完事大吉  杰森
It's not over, Jason.

241
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,086
鲍尔手里有一段录音
Bauer has a recording

242
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:30,028
能证明我跟萨瓦洛夫有牵连
that implicates me along with Suvarov.

243
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,023
您怎么知道的
How do you know?

244
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,090
因为这该死的一切都是那狗杂种设计我的
Because the son of a bitch played the damn thing for me.

245
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:36,001
袭击车队的时候
He must've put a bug on me somewhere

246
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,037
他一定在我身上放了窃听器
when he attacked the car.

247
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:38,077
据我所知
For all I know,

248
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:42,058
他录下了我过去两小时的所有对话
he has recorded every conversation I've had for the past two hours.

249
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,028
我就在现场
I'm on site now.

250
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,051
我会叫他把一切都吐出来
I'll recover whatever he's got.

251
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:49,099
你也是这绳上的蚂蚱
You're on the line here, too.

252
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:52,002
这证据要是给抖了出去
If this evidence gets out,

253
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:54,032
咱们都得吃不了兜着走
we all go down together.

254
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,053
没错  我知道形势岌岌可危  总统阁下
Yeah, I understand what's at stake, Mr. President.

255
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,039
录音一到手我就给您打电话
I'll call you back when I have the recording.

256
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:59,039
好
Yeah.

257
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,074
他情况稳定了吗
Is he stable?

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,079
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

259
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,041
长官  按您的指示  我搜了鲍尔的身
Sir, as you requested, I searched Bauer.

260
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,065
我们仍在搜查现场  但目前只找到这些
We're still combing the site, but that's what we found so far.

261
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,015
就这些吗
Is there nothing else?

262
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,070
如我所言  长官  我们仍在排查
Like I said, sir, we're still sweeping.

263
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,014
这部电话该是您的吧
I believe this phone is yours.

264
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,069
对
Yeah.

265
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,073
这个是...
It's a, uh,

266
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,096
一个数码录音机  长官  不过是空的
digital recorder, sir, but it's clean.

267
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,000
里面什么也没有
There's nothing in it.

268
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,030
过来
Come here.

269
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,087
回避一下
Excuse us.

270
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,061
数据卡丢失了
The data card is missing.

271
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,017
鲍尔有个数字录音文件
Bauer has a digital file

272
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,081
会威胁到国家安全
that poses a threat to national security.

273
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,090
我们得找到它
We need to find it.

274
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,015
是  长官  我们会继续搜查
Yes, sir. We'll keep looking.

275
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,050
刚才都发生了什么
What happened up here?

276
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,094
看他掏枪我就开枪打了他
He drew his gun and I shot him.

277
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:01,029
你还想问什么
What more do you need to know?

278
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:03,003
鲍尔给你什么东西了吗
Did Bauer give you anything?

279
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:05,009
他会有什么东西给我
What would he have given me?

280
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,060
鲍尔的数码录音机
Bauer had a digital recorder.

281
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,063
里面的数据卡失踪了
The data card's missing.

282
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,027
我想你该知道它的下落
I thought you might know where it is.

283
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,070
我都不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

284
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:13,077
你有没有看见他把它藏到哪了
You didn't see him stash it anywhere?

285
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,066
我要是看见了  早就拿去作为证据登记了
If I did, I would've taken it and already logged it as evidence.

286
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,088
那你不介意把口袋掏干净吧
Then you don't mind emptying your pockets.

287
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:25,005
我刚枪击了我的朋友  所以...
I just shot my friend, so...

288
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,028
要是不想逼我亲自动手的话
Unless you want me to do it for you,

289
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:28,018
就赶紧给我把口袋掏空
I need you to empty your pockets now.

290
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,012
凭什么
On what grounds?

291
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,039
国家安全
National security.

292
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,019
快掏吧
Let's go.

293
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:52,017
要是我搜你的身  会不会找到数据卡呢
If I search you, will I find that data card?

294
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,031
真是无理取闹
This is ridiculous.

295
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,005
手抬起来
Put your hands up here.

296
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,092
我告诉你了  我开枪打了杰克
I just told you, I shot Jack.

297
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,012
我又怎么会去帮他
Why would I be helping him?

298
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:07,092
抱歉  奥布赖恩女士  我是为了保险起见
Sorry, Ms. O'Brian, I have to be absolutely sure.

299
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:31,061
希望你摸得尽兴
Hope you enjoyed yourself.

300
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,066
都结束了  杰克
It's over, Jack.

301
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:14,092
你跟我交代的话  还能给自己留点后路
You need to talk to me; maybe do yourself some good.

302
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,099
数据卡在哪
Where's the data card?

303
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:23,047
他的情况能不去医院就在反恐组接受治疗吗
Is he stable enough to be treated at CTU instead of the hospital?

304
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,070
应该可以
He should be.

305
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:26,046
他真走运  是子弹贯穿伤
He got lucky. It's a through and through.

306
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,024
子弹贯穿伤
Through and through.

307
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,085
子弹没有伤及他的任何脏器和动脉
Bullet didn't hit any of his organs or his arteries.

308
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,027
如果要选择枪击的部位  你就该选择打那里
If you're going to get shot anywhere, that's where you want it to happen.

309
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,094
这狗杂种
Son of a bitch!

310
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,057
给我接移动指挥部
Get me mobile command.

311
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,045
什么
What?

312
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:41,011
你想跟我说什么
You got something to say to me?

313
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,024
有话就快说
If you've got something to say, you'd better say it now.

314
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,023
说的什么
What?

315
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,089
把他弄走
Get him out of here!

316
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,010
拘禁奥布赖恩
Lock down O'Brian!

317
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,018
阿洛准备好接收文件了
Arlo's ready to receive the file.

318
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,081
克罗伊  你得告诉我为什么枪击杰克
Chloe, you need to tell me why you shot Jack.

319
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,015
杰克说如果不开枪他们会怀疑我
Jack said they'd suspect me if I didn't;

320
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,048
他说我把证据带出去的唯一出路就是朝他开枪
He said my only way out of there with the evidence is to shoot him.

321
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,000
医疗报告上说是贯穿伤
Medical report said it went clean through.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,014
无脏器损伤
That no vital organs were hit.

323
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,003
你别说你是故意要避开的吧
You're telling me you meant to miss them?

324
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:22,093
你怎么有把握你不会打死他
How did you know you wouldn't kill him?

325
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,047
我没把握
I didn't.

326
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,017
开始上传了  这用不了多久
It's uploading now. It shouldn't take long.

327
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,056
上传进行中
Upload In Progress

328
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,055
克罗伊
Chloe...

329
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,038
再给我争取几秒钟的时间
I just need a few more seconds.

330
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,029
-什么事  -我们奉命
- What's going on?  - We just got orders

331
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,002
-来拘禁克罗伊·奥布赖恩  -什么命令
- to lock down Chloe O'Brian.  - What orders?

332
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,042
-请让开  -除非你给我解释清楚
- Please step aside.  - I'm not going anywhere

333
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:36,028
否则我绝不会让道
till you tell me what's going on.

334
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,034
长官  警告你最后一遍
Sir, we're not going to ask you again.

335
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,017
让开
Step aside.

336
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,016
别  我命令你住手
Don't-- I order you-- stop!

337
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,091
我命令你住手  不要啊
I'm ordering you to stop! Don't!

338
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,033
数据传输未完成  上传失败
Data Transfer Incomplete  Upload Failure

339
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,092
奥布赖恩女士  这是杰克·鲍尔给你的数据卡吗
Ms. O'Brian, is this the data card that Jack Bauer gave you?

340
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,090
是的  你该听听里面的内容
Yes. You need to listen to what's on it.

341
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,030
这个由皮勒先生决定
Mr. Pillar will make that determination.

342
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:51,063
皮勒也参与了掩盖真相的阴谋
Pillar is part of the cover-up.

343
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,014
他不会让数据卡作为证据存在
That data card will never make it to evidence.

344
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,030
求你了
Please!

345
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:56,054
-把他们押在这里  -别这样
- Hold them here.  - Don't do this!

346
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,057
伯克
Burke!

347
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:59,041
伯克  别这么做
Burke, stop what you're doing!

348
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,013
想清楚你在做什么
Think about what you're doing!

349
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,001
伯克  别走
Burke, stop!

350
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,088
-我是皮勒  -皮勒先生
- Pillar.  - Mr. Pillar,

351
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,055
我拘禁了奥布赖恩
I locked down O'Brian.

352
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,022
看起来奥迪斯探员和她是同伙
Looks like she was working with Agent Ortiz.

353
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:13,055
他也被我们拘禁了
He's in custody, too.

354
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:14,099
找到数据卡了吗
Get the data card?

355
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,019
找到了  长官
Yes, sir.

356
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:18,049
奥布赖恩正试图向反恐组主服务器上传那文件
O'Brian was trying to upload the file to the main servers at CTU,

357
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:20,055
但被我及时终止了
but I stopped the transmission.

358
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:22,045
干得好  伯克探员
Good work, Agent Burke.

359
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:25,022
现在把奥布赖恩和奥迪斯带去反恐组关押起来
All right, send O'Brian and Ortiz to CTU lockdown

360
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,056
禁止任何人和他们说话
and talk to no one.

361
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:28,056
把那张数据卡交给罗根总统
Get that data card to President Logan.

362
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,031
明白  长官
Yes, sir.

363
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:32,039
带他们去反恐小组
Take them to CTU.

364
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,043
就是这东西
This is it.

365
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,027
这就是杰克·鲍尔录下的那段录音
This is the recording that Jack Bauer made.

366
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,053
鲍尔当时正和克罗伊·奥布赖恩
Bauer was working with Chloe O'Brian

367
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:02,047
以及一个叫科尔·奥迪斯的外勤探员合作
and a field agent called Cole Ortiz.

368
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:04,047
他们企图用反恐小组的服务器
They were planning to use CTU's servers

369
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:06,051
把这段录音
to disseminate this recording

370
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,051
大面积散布给新闻机构  政府官员
to news organizations, and-and government officials

371
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,052
以及舆论监督组织
and watchdog groups on a massive scale.

372
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,052
这计划险些就得逞了
It almost worked.

373
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,090
我的人  通过他们锲而不舍的努力
My people, they never gave up,

374
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,025
现在一切都结束了
and now it's over.

375
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,009
您赢了
You won.

376
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,047
祝贺您
Congratulations.

377
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,096
你听过这段录音吗
Have you listened to this?

378
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,017
听过  但说实话  根本不值得一听
Yes, yes, but frankly, it's not worth hearing.

379
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,008
杰克现在人在哪
Where is Jack now?

380
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:35,014
他将在我们的严密看守下被押送去反恐小组
He's about to be transported to CTU under heavy guard.

381
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:39,042
我明白这让您很为难
I realize that this is a difficult area,

382
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,098
但有一点我们可以肯定
but the one thing we can be certain of

383
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:45,045
就是杰克·鲍尔永远都不会善罢甘休
is that Jack Bauer will never let this go.

384
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,075
对
No.

385
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:50,085
我没指望他会罢手
I don't suppose he will.

386
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:55,086
一切丰功伟绩
All great achievements in state...

387
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,055
都十分脆弱
are fragile things,

388
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,028
总统阁下
Madam President.

389
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,063
尤其在其萌芽阶段
Especially in their infancy.

390
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,028
它们需要呵护
They need to be protected.

391
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:09,021
我们的和平协议  是经不起打击的
Our peace agreement-- very vulnerable.

392
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:11,047
杰克·鲍尔一天不除
As long as Jack Bauer is out there,

393
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:14,018
这协议就永远不能安全
the agreement will never be safe.

394
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:16,021
那我们就把他关起来
Then we will lock him away

395
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,060
关到远离我国的秘密监狱去
in a black site halfway around the world.

396
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,088
他还是会设法回来报复的
He will find a way,

397
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,025
总统阁下
Madam President.

398
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:23,074
仔细听我说
Mark my words.

399
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:27,089
他即便身处绝境亦能卷土重来
He will rise out of the deepest hole in the ground.

400
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:30,093
就算沦落到世界的尽头
He will claw his way back

401
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,096
他也一定会杀回来
from the ends of the earth,

402
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:36,053
除非斩草除根  以绝后患
unless we stop him before that can happen.

403
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:46,005
请您批准在下斗胆承担起了...
Pending approval, I have taken upon myself to, uh...

404
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,012
执行此计划的责任
put a plan in motion.

405
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,065
你是够大胆
Of course you have.

406
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,084
我将把您的沉默  看作是默许
I will take your silence as tacit approval.

407
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,072
很多好人都在今天丧生
A lot of good people died today,

408
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,015
不止是哈桑总统
not just President Hassan,

409
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:37,083
反恐组探员们  其他执法机构的工作人员们
operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies.

410
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,030
还有蕾妮·沃克
Renee Walker.

411
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,064
她和我关系非常亲密
Who I was very close to.

412
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:52,024
今天他们的死就是因为萨瓦洛夫总统
These people died today because President Suvarov

413
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:55,031
为一己之私利企图撕毁和平协议造成的
wanted to destroy the peace treaty for his own interests,

414
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,048
而我将这一切都告诉了泰勒总统
and President Taylor knows this because I told her,

415
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,073
但她却想掩盖事实真相
but she's willing to cover it up

416
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:01,032
因为她认为和平协议的意义更为重大
because she believes the peace accord will serve the greater good.

417
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,062
她错了  那毫无用处
She is wrong; it won't.

418
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,012
请讲
Yes.

419
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,076
总统阁下  双方的代表团都到了
Both delegations are here, ma'am.

420
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:13,030
秘书长到了吗
What about the secretary general?

421
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,040
他就在外面大厅里
He's just outside in the atrium.

422
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:18,007
谢谢你  蒂姆
Thank you, Tim.

423
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:31,015
仅靠政治博弈并不能获得持久和平
Lasting peace cannot simply be political.

424
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,083
和平必须建立在相互信任  真诚相待
It has to be born out of trust and honesty

425
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,062
和相互理解的基础上
and understanding

426
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:38,062
最重要的  就是双方维持和平的共同意愿
and most importantly, a will on both sides to move forward.

427
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,093
而现在  这一意愿不存在
Currently, that will does not exist.

428
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,099
这种和平是骗来的
This peace is fraudulent,

429
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,082
而我的良心也绝不允许
and I cannot in good conscience

430
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:48,095
今天死去的人们就这么含恨而终
allow the people that lost their lives today to go unspoken for.

431
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:53,060
而你在今天早些时候还提醒过我这些
You reminded me of that earlier today.

432
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,097
这就是我
That's who I am.

433
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,093
正在处理鲍尔了
Bauer is being handled.

434
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
-搞定了吗  -是的  阁下
- Is it done?  - Yes, sir.

435
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,046
好
All right, then.

436
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:28,040
知道吗  我之前没把握
You know, I wasn't sure

437
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,011
总统会有胆量完成这件事
the president had the balls to see this through.

438
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,011
显然  我低估她了
Clearly, I underestimated her.

439
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,004
我们都低估她了  阁下
We both did, sir.

440
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,039
总统阁下  祝您好运
Good luck, Madam President.

441
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,071
我们一定要办一个庆功会
This calls for a celebration.

442
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,065
来缓解下你耳朵的疼痛
Huh, a little something to numb that ear pain?

443
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,075
喝点什么
What are you drinking?

444
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,045
我随意  总统阁下
Whatever you're having, Mr. President.

445
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,049
杰森  干得漂亮
You did well, Jason.

446
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:27,007
你一直在向着目标奋斗
You kept your eye on the prize.

447
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:29,040
谢谢您  阁下
Thank you, sir.

448
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:33,004
恭喜总统即将在楼下
Here's to, uh, all the political capital

449
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,034
将所有的政治资本押在和平协议上
the president is about to bank downstairs.

450
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,067

517
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:11,063
我将做一段简要陈述  不回答任何提问
My statement is brief, and I will take no questions.

518
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,084
较早之前
Moments ago,

519
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:17,051
泰勒总统放弃签署和平协议
President Taylor declined to sign the peace accord

520
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,084
并中途离场
and excused herself from the proceedings.

521
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,043
在此之前  她宣称有犯罪行为但未透露详情
She did so after making allegations of crimes which she did not specify,

522
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:27,023
联合国方面亦不知情

泰勒总统说她一小时之内将会出面

528
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:46,014
泰勒总统自己...
President Taylor herself, after...

529
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:51,098
一定是总统来问鲍尔的事
That's the President asking about Bauer.

530
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:57,085
别接
No.

531

不要再罪上加罪被告谋杀了
Let's not add murder to the list of charges already against us.

535
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,056
杰森  你说的有道理

这是我最后的机会
This was my last chance,

541
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,070
却让鲍尔给毁了
and Bauer took it away.

542
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,029
就因为他才落到这般田地
It's come to this because of him.

543
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,043
锁着呢
It's locked.

We need the master key to room 2206 immediately.

547

该死  查尔斯  开门

548
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,097
蒂姆  别让罗根死了
Tim, I need Logan alive!

549
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:52,035
能救过来吗
Can they save him?

550
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,011
他们认为可以  不过总统阁下
They think so, but Madam President,

551
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:55,087
他们说即便他恢复了意识
they're saying that even if he regains consciousness,

552
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:58,027
也很可能受到了严重的脑损伤
he's probably suffered severe brain damage.

553
00:33:58,027 --> 00:34:01,031
他知道自己是唯一能够找到杰克的人
He knew he was the only one who could locate Jack.

554
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,087
未必如此
Not necessarily.

555
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,005
反恐组的无人机在最近四小时内一直在巡航
CTU's drones have been in the air for the last four hours.

556
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,055
他们也许可以通过之前的监控录像
They may be able to back-trace Jack from the ambush site

557
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,098
从伏击地点逆向追踪到杰克的下落
using archived surveillance video.

558
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,065
克罗伊·奥布赖恩在哪
Where is Chloe O'Brian?

559
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:13,095
她和奥迪斯约十分钟前返回了反恐组
She and Agent Ortiz returned to CTU about ten minutes ago,

560
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:16,086
-被拘捕了  -马上把他们放出来

561
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,087
告诉克罗伊  一切资源都归她调遣

放开我
Let go of me!

567
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:35,077
奥布赖恩  你没有权力这么做
O'Brian, you have no authority.

568
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:37,034
我不知道你清不清楚自己在做什么
I don't know what you think you're doing.

569
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,026
-把嘴闭上往前走  -这是怎么回事
- Shut up and keep moving. - What the hell is going on?

570
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:41,066
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me!

571
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,074
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

572
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:44,005
泰勒总统没签署协议
President Taylor didn't sign the agreement.

573
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:46,010
她最后时刻毁约了  但是她已经下令
She backed out at the last minute, but she had already ordered

574
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,092
-袭击杰克了  -她中止行动了吗
- the hit on Jack. - Did she call it off?

575
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,061
她试了  但是送杰克的救护车已遭遇了伏击
She tried, but his ambulance has been ambushed.

576
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:51,031
她联系不到那些杀手
She has no way of contacting the hitters.

577
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:53,051
-她怎么可能知道杰克还活着  -她不知道
- How does she even know Jack's still alive? - She doesn't.

578
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,095
她让其他人都离开了
She's had everyone cleared from the floor

579
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:56,071
现在只剩你  我  还有阿洛

拜托  阿洛  别让我失望

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,012
转身  跪下
Turn around. Down on your knees.

600
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,094
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

601
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:21,042
所以我会利索些  给你个痛快
So I'm going to make this, uh, quick and clean.

602
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,083
我是不是该谢谢你
Am I supposed to say thank you?

603
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,067
别过来  别过来
Stand down! Stand down!

604
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:05,073
我真的不想这么做  但军令如山
I really don't want to do this, but orders are orders.

605
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:07,074
没关系
It's all right.

606
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:12,046
开枪吧
Pull the trigger.

607
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:15,001
长官  长官
Sir! Sir!

608
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,067
等等  别开枪
Wait! Hold your fire!

609
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,031
是泰勒总统
It's President Taylor.

610
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,059
我无法确认她的身份
I don't have positive confirmation,

611
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:26,085
但声音很像
but it sounds like her.

612
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:28,072
她说反恐小组的无人机就在我们头顶
She says CTU has a drone overhead.

613
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:30,008
他们扫描到了定向微波信号
They're got a directed microwave signal.

614
00:37:30,008 --> 00:37:32,016
才接进这个电话中来
That's how they got through to the phone.

615
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,038
我命令你立刻释放杰克·鲍尔

616
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:48,084
-阁下  -你听不懂吗

617
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,061
你和你的手下马上释放鲍尔先生
You and your men are to leave Mr. Bauer where he is.

618
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,076
停止行动并撤退到西门之外
Stand down and withdraw outside the west gate

619
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:58,010
一直等到联调局的人到达
until the FBI arrives.

620
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,092
如果在那之前你有任何逃离现场的企图
If you have any thoughts of fleeing before then,

621
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:02,011
那架无人机可是装备了
the drone is equipped with

622
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,033
两枚AGM-114地狱火导弹
two AGM-114 hellfire missiles.

623
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,022
我会毫不犹豫地使用它们
I will not hesitate to use them.

624
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,039
-听明白了吗  -是的  阁下
- Are we clear? - Yes, ma'am.

625
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,067
现在  让鲍尔先生接电话
Now, put Mr. Bauer on the phone.

626
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:15,097
把手铐打开
Uncuff him.

627
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,004
-阁下  -我叫你把手铐打开
- Sir? - I said, "Uncuff him."

628
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,091
我命令你停止行动并撤离现场
You're ordered to stand down and evacuate.

629
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,065
过来集合  我们要撤离了
We're rolling up and evacuating.

630
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,041
上车吧
Let's get in the van.

631
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:39,032
行动起来  快点
Let's move. Now.

632
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,085
总统想要和你通话
The President wants to talk to you.

633
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,088
杰克
Jack?

634
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,060
你真该让他们杀了我
You should've let them kill me...

635
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:04,037
此事不做个了结  我决不善罢甘休
'cause I'm not going to quit until this is over.

636
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,055
这事已经了结了
It is over.

637
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:12,016
我一刻钟前退出了和平协议的签署仪式
I withdrew 15 minutes ago from the signing of the peace treaty.

638
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:15,067
一小时之内  我会告诉全世界
Within the hour, I will tell the world

639
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,075
今天到底发生了什么
what happened today.

640
00:39:18,015 --> 00:39:20,005
我会提出辞职
I will tender my resignation

641
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:22,067
并向司法部长提出将自己还押候审
and remand myself to the attorney general...

642
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:25,059
面对我自己酿下的苦果
and face the consequences of my actions.

643
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:29,086
不幸的是  你也要同样这么做
Unfortunately, you will have to do the same.

644
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:34,095
我一心想要求得这份和平  杰克
I wanted this peace so badly, Jack.

645
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:37,083
为此  我违背了
And for that, I have betrayed

646
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,071
自己曾坚持的每一条原则
every principle that I have ever stood for.

647
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:44,069
我也背叛了你
And I betrayed you.

648
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:48,031
如果我听了你的话
If I had listened to you,

649
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,047
这一切就不会发生了
none of this would have happened.

650
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,087
我们都犯过错误  也必须直面这些错误
We've both made mistakes we're going to have to live with.

651
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:57,094
我愿用一切来换取时间倒流
I would give anything to take back the time.

652
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,048
但我现在能做到的  只有告诉你
But all I can do is tell you

653
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:04,026
趁还有机会  逃出国去吧
to leave the country while you still have a chance.

654
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:08,008
俄罗斯人不会放过你的
The Russians will be coming after you.

655
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,040
我们的人也不会
And so will we.

656
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:15,090
杰克  我真的很抱歉
Jack, I am so sorry.

657
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,042
我不知道还能说些什么
I don't know what else to say.

658
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:55,073
-杰克  -克罗伊
- Jack?  - Chloe,

659
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:57,061
总统刚刚把情况向我说明了
the president just told me what was happening.

660
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:58,076
她说她会给我一点时间
She said she was going to give me a little time

661
00:40:58,076 --> 00:40:59,099
想办法逃出国去
to try and get out of the country.

662
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,036
-我知道  我听到通话了  -我女儿
- I know. I was on the call. - My daughter...

663
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,064
她的家人  那帮人会试图利用她来抓我
her family-- they're going to try and use her to get to me.

664
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:05,087
我会确保他们的安全
I'll make sure they're protected.

665
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:08,025
不  克罗伊  你要向我保证
No. Chloe, you've got to promise me.

666
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:10,008
向我保证他们不会出任何事
You've got to promise me you'll keep them safe.

667
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:12,056
我会保护他们的  我向你保证
I'll make sure they're protected. I promise.

668
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:15,017
我还有多长时间
How much time do you think I've got?

669
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:18,025
我不知道  我会尽量帮你争取时间
I don't know. I'll get you as much time as I can.

670
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,012
克罗伊
Chloe...

671
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,050
什么
What?

672
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,057
你刚来反恐小组的时候
When you first came to CTU...

673
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:38,028
我真的没有想到  会是你
I never thought it was going to be you

674
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,067
这么多年来一直支持帮助我
that was going to cover my back all those years.

675
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,092
我知道你今天所做的一切
And I know that everything that you did today

676
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:46,073
都是为了保护我  我了解

677
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,063
谢谢你

好的
Yeah...

680
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:05,077
本片至此  《反恐24小时》即将落幕

681
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:08,052
蓦然回首  一路上  我们确实失去了很多...

682
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:12,051
但我们更收获良多  这份经历  这份感动

683
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:16,078
这份并肩战斗的友谊  千金不换

684
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:21,098
把无人机召回基地
Bring the drone back to the base.

685
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,032
刚才的事  就当没发生过
Whatever happened here didn't happen.

686
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:25,016
明白了吗
Understand?

687
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:47,079
把画面关掉
Shut it down.

688
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,029
"输了你  赢了世界又如何"

689
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:53,041
这首歌  献给你  我们的《反恐24小时》
