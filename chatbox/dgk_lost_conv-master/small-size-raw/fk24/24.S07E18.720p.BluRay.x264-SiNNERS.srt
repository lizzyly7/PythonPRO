我想我可能知道
I think I might.

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,088
我是奉美国总统之令行事

给我离开这儿
With all of you on board.

拉里  我要你和你的人

00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,085
佯装按霍奇斯的意思准时撤兵
To pull out on Hodges' Timetable.

19
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:44,088
托尼  你想办法潜伏下来
Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.

20
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:46,037
我们会通过无线电让你

跟一个斯塔克伍德内部人士取得联系

待在这  我马上回来

25
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:56,062
杰克

叫医护人员来
We need a medic!

27
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,008
生化剂比我们想的要厉害得多
The bioagent is more virulent than we thought.

28
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,075
我们所做的只是掩蔽症状而已
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.

29
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,029
我明白
I understand.

30
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,095
不过有件事你也许会考虑一下

一种采用干细胞的可能疗法

00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,038
我看过你的档案  你有个女儿
I saw your file, and it says you have a daughter.

35
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:15,062
我不想把我的女儿牵扯进来
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

36
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:17,065
这应该由她来决定
It should be her choice.

37
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:18,075
不是
Well, it's not.

38
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:20,042
我才是快死的那个

我进来了

你的那一点点忠心
A little loyalty.

42
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,092
我还是应得的吧
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

43
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,035
你不能和政府作对啊
You can't take on the federal government.

44
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,012
我看见武器了
I have a visual on the weapon.

45
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,055
是毒气罐
Okay, those are the canisters.

46
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,065
我去通知史密斯上将  目标已找到并确认
I'll notify Admiral Smith the target is located and confirmed.

47
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:43,062
您还记得斯塔克伍德驻扎在巴基斯坦吧
You remember Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan,

48
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:46,045
那时我们征用过一种导弹系统

您要对此次会晤守口如瓶
You will keep this conversation to yourself

53
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,085
并且召回战斗机
And turn the planes around.

54
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:59,028
您要是不答应的话  总统阁下
And if you do not comply, Madam President,

55
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,002
我就别无选择
I will have no choice

56
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,082
只能发射那些导弹
But to launch those missiles.

57
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,082
史密斯上将  取消空袭
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

58
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:05,098
阁下  恕我直言

59
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,002
见鬼  上将
Damn it, admiral.

杰克  究竟发生什么事了

F-18战斗机呢

蒂姆·伍兹刚从白宫打电话来说

为什么
Why?

73
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,015
她觉得我们的情报
She doesn't believe our intel

74
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,095
不足以构成军事打击的理由
Is strong enough to justify military action.

75
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,065
她疯了吗
Is she out of her mind?

76
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,085
杰克  我亲眼见到那些毒气罐
Jack, I saw those canisters with my own eyes.

77
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,038
你也看见了  它们就在那地堡里
So did you. they're in that bunker.

78
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,098
-没有比这更好的证据了  -我知道
- She's not gonna get any better intel than that. - I know.

79
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,022
是想不明白  但现在
It doesn't make any sense, but right now,

80
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,095
总统下令  你和周边的小队
We've got a presidential order to pull you out

81
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,052
得马上撤出斯塔克伍德
Of the Starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams.

82
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,098
托尼  拉里已经知道了总统的决定
Tony, Larry's been told the president's decision.

83
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,022
他正准备把队伍撤走
He's preparing to move his teams out

84
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,068
但这之前他得先把你弄出去
but he's got to get you out of there first.

85
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,075
他会给你发送坐标  在西南边上
He'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration point

86
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:13,002
有一个逃出的缺口
Along the southwest perimeter.

87
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,032
托尼
Tony?

88
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,038
等等
Hold on a second.

89
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,042
托尼  怎么了
Tony, what's going on?

90
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,015
杰克  我可能知道为什么总统取消空袭了
Jack, I might know why the president called off that air strike.

91
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,068
什么意思
What do you mean?

92
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:34,022
我觉得斯塔克伍德拥有地对地导弹
I think Starkwood's got surface-to-surface missiles.

93
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,098
这些导弹正可用来部署生化武器
That's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.

94
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,052
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

95
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:40,032
有辆油罐车刚停在了地堡旁边
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker

96
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:41,088
武器就在地堡里
Where they're storing the weapons.

97
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:46,064
他们正把RP-7输送进地下燃料库里
They're pumping RP-7 into an underground depot.

98
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:47,038
RP-7是什么
What's RP-7?

99
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,044
是一种助推燃料  只用于地对地导弹
It's a propellant only used in surface-to-surface missiles.

100
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,084
托尼  你确定吗
Tony, are you sure?

101
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:53,000
杰克  这东西就在我眼前呢
I'm looking right at it, Jack.

102
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,065
你带了C-4炸药没
Do you have any C-4 on you?

103
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:58,095
带了三个  还有一个遥控引爆器
Yeah, I've got three charges and a remote detonator.

104
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:01,038
你觉得你可以进到地下燃料库吗
Do you think you can gain access to the underground fuel depot?

105
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:02,092
我觉得可以赌一把
Yeah, I think we've got a play,

106
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,055
但我得赶在油罐车开走前
But I've got to move soon...

107
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,032
赶快行动了
Before that fuel truck pulls away.

108
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,095
好  原地待命
Okay, I want you to maintain your position.

109
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,032
我去给总统打电话
I'm gonna call the president.

110
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,035
跟我来
Come with me.

111
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:17,042
蒂姆  什么事
What is it, Tim?

112
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,062
总统阁下  参谋长联席会议委员们
Madam President, the Joint Chiefs

113
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,022
开始质疑您
Are beginning to question your decision

114
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,018
取消对斯塔克伍德进行空中打击的决定了
To call off the air strike against Starkwood.

115
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,068
他们认为  从托尼·阿尔梅达那里
They think the intelligence we received from Tony Almeida

116
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,085
收到的情报很充分  我们可能正错失
Was sufficient and that we may be missing

117
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:33,013
毁灭生化武器的大好时机
An opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.

118
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,028
蒂姆  我已经下了命令
I gave my orders, Tim.

119
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:35,092
不进行空中打击

120
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:39,045
也不进行针对斯塔克伍德的一切军事行动
No military action of any kind against Starkwood.

121
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:43,043
现在  我要你去处理好联席参谋长会议事宜
Now, I asked you to handle the Joint Chiefs;

122
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,034
并安抚好他们

123
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,025
阁下  我会尽力而为  但斗胆问一下
I'll do my best, ma'am, But if I may...

124
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,033
我们下一步计划是什么
What is our next move?

125
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,095
乔纳斯·霍奇斯在来白宫的路上了
Jonas Hodges is coming to the White House.

126
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:57,050
他想跟我单独谈谈
He wants to speak with me alone.

127
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,078
-他来干什么  -我不知道
- For what possible reason? - I don't know.

128
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,038
总统阁下  您的顾问们
Madam President, shouldn't your advisors

129
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,038
不应该出席这次会面吗
Be at that meeting?

130
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,035
蒂姆  别再向我发难了
Tim, stop asking me questions.

131
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:09,042
如果你真想帮忙
If you want to help,

132
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,045
乔纳斯·霍奇斯要来的消息
Make sure as few people as possible know

133
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,005
让越少人知道越好
That Jonas Hodges is coming here.

134
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:17,045
把他从东南面的便门带进来
And bring him in through the southeast service entrance.

135
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,078
什么事
Yes?

136

总统阁下  杰克·鲍尔

是的  阁下  五分钟前
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.

140
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,072
我跟他们说了您取消空袭的原因
I gave them your reason for calling off

141
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,028
但不得不提醒您
The air strike, but I must warn you,

142
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,022
他们对此也深表怀疑
They were skeptical as well.

143
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,072
准备好接霍奇斯
Be ready for Hodges.

144
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,098
鲍尔先生
Mr. Bauer,

145

总统阁下  我得跟您谈谈

147
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,038
不  鲍尔先生  不需要
No, Mr. Bauer, we don't.

148
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,055
你得听我说

感谢你为了收集这些情报所做的一切
I appreciate everything that you have done in gathering this intel,

150
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,020
但在下令进行空袭前
But I still need more

151
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,065
我还需要更多信息
Before I can authorize an air strike.

152
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,065
抱歉
I'm sorry.

153
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:54,098
总统阁下  恕我直言
Madam President, with all due respect,

154
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,045
我觉得您没跟我们说实话
I don't believe you're being truthful with us.

155
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:59,098
什么
Excuse me?

156
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,042
我认为您取消空袭
I think you called off the air strike

157
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,075
是因为乔纳斯·霍奇斯拥有
Because Jonas Hodges is in possession

158
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,012
载有生化武器的地对地导弹
Of surface-to-surface missiles armed with the bioweapon,

159
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,058
他以此要挟
And he's threatening to use them

160
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,045
防止您对他采取行动
In case you try to take action against him.

161
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,038
总统阁下  托尼·阿尔梅达亲眼见到
Madam President, Tony Almeida witnessed a truck

162
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,052
油罐车把RP-7火箭助推剂输送到
Pumping RP-7 rocket fuel into an underground depot

163
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:15,092
地堡旁的燃料库里
Situated right next to the bunker

164
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,075
生化武器就藏在地堡中
Where the bioweapons are being stored.

165
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:20,015
而RP-7火箭助推剂的唯一用途
The only purpose for RP-7 rocket fuel

166
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,058
就是发射导弹
Is to launch missiles.

167
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:27,022
总统阁下  请告诉我们实情好吗
Madam President, please just tell us the truth.

168
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,052
杰克  霍奇斯持有13枚
Jack, Hodges has 13 Python missiles

169
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,028
载有生化武器的巨蟒导弹
Armed with the bioweapons.

170
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:36,058
其中三枚正对准美国城市
Three are currently aimed at American cities.

171
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:39,079
他要求我召回战斗机  否则就会发射导弹
He demanded that I recall the planes, or he would launch.

172
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,003
霍奇斯葫芦里卖的什么药啊
What does Hodges want?

173
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:43,078
我不知道  但他要求几分钟后在白宫
I don't know... But he's requested a face-to-face meeting.

174
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:45,012
跟我面对面谈话
He'll be at the White House in a few minutes.

175
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:47,068
总统阁下  他想面对面对话的唯一目的
Madam President, the only reason he wants a face-to-face meeting

176
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:48,074
就是摆出他的要求
is to lay out his demands,

177
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,065
不管他要求什么  您都不能妥协
And whatever they are, you cannot negotiate with him.

178
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:53,008
杰克  我并未打算跟他谈判
I'm not planning on negotiating with him, Jack.

179
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:55,092
一旦他摊牌了
Once he places his cards on the table,

180
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:58,055
我确信我能  我能让他认识到
I am sure that I can... I can make him realize

181
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:01,002
他所做的这一切只是枉费心机
The futility of what he is trying to do.

182
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,062
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是叛国者  是恐怖分子
Jonas Hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,

183
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,040
基于他今天的所作所为
And after everything that's happened today,

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,008
你还真的天真到认为能说服他
Are you really naive enough to believe that you can simply talk to him

185
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,015
改变他的想法
And change his mind?

186
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:10,075
杰克  这方面我有经验的
I'm not new at this, Jack,

187
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,078
而且现在  我已别无选择了
And right now, I don't have another option.

188
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:14,036
总统阁下  您仍有选择的
Madam President, you do.

189
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,030
托尼·阿尔梅达还在斯塔克伍德里面
Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.

190
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,061
我下过令让他马上撤离的
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.

191
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,063
他还在那里干什么
What's he still doing there?

192
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,070
在我跟您商量过之前  我叫他原地待命
I asked him to stand by until I could talk to you.

193
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,093
他认为自己能够进到燃料库
He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot

194
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,029
放置连环炸药装置
And lay a series of explosive charges

195
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,058
从而摧毁那些导弹
And take the missiles out.

196
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:29,005
我相信能成功  但我们得赶快行动
Now, I believe this can work, but we need to act quickly.

197
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,042
毒气不会扩散吗
What about the bioweapons?

198
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,088
RP-7火箭助推剂燃烧起来有5000度
RP-7 rocket fuel burns at 5,000 degrees.

199
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,038
毒气会被燃烧殆尽
There will be nothing left.

200
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,052
一旦摧毁了武器  拉里·莫斯跟他的队伍
Once the weapons are destroyed, Larry Moss and his teams

201
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,078
就能进入斯塔克伍德并封锁那里
Can move in on Starkwood and lock it down.

202
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:41,015
霍奇斯给他的手下下令
Hodges gave standing orders to his men

203
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,055
一旦发现政府介入
To launch the missiles at the first detection

204
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,055
立即发射导弹
Of government interference.

205
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,098
杰克  如果阿尔梅达被发现了
If Almeida is detected,

206
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,032
会有成千上万美国人丧生
Thousands of Americans will die, Jack.

207
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,002
总统阁下  我知道这有风险
Madam President, I know that there's a risk,

208
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,008
但要是没有成功的把握
But I would not be asking you to do this

209
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,025
我也不会求您这么做
If I didn't think it would work.

210
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:57,048
拜托了  我求您了
Please, I am begging you.

211
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,026
相信我
Trust me.

212
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,006
医生有没有说你还能活多久
How long didthe doctors give you to live?

213
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:11,068
他们还不确定
Uh, they're not sure,

214
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:15,068
但是已经开始发病了
But the pathogen has started to take effect.

215
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:21,025
那我也没什么可威胁你的了  对吗
Then there's not much I can threaten you with, is there?

216
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:26,012
觉得对的  你就去做吧
I expect you'll do what you think is right.

217
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,048
那是什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

218
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,038
她希望我们继续干
She wants us to go in.

219
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,095
但她没有授权啊
But she didn't authorize it.

220
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,008
她不能
She can't.

221
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,022
这只能是一次秘密行动
She needs this to be a covert operation.

222
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,062
若有半点差池
If something were to go wrong

223
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,010
致使导弹发射出去
And those missiles were to be launched,

224
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,075
总统必须得发誓
The president needs to be able to swear

225
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,034
这绝对只是我们单方面擅自行动
Under oath that we were working on our own

226
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,022
她希望我们继续行动
She wants us to go in.

227
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,068
通知拉里  我们得快点
Notify Larry. we need to move fast.

228
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,032
我告诉过你我能把你带到白宫
I told you I'd get you to the White House.

229
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:05,075
只是没想到  是以这种方式
I just didn't think it would be under these conditions.

230
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,065
太有才了
It was brilliant, you know.

231
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,022
长官  您指什么
What was that, sir?

232
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,058
就是你让阿尔梅达相信
What you didto make Almeida think

233
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,006
你会背叛我
That you were betraying me.

234
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,008
太有才了
Quite brilliant.

235
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,024
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

236
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,068
格雷格  你不顾个人安危
You put yourself in harm's way, Greg,

237
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,082
我会铭记在心
And I'll never forget that.

238
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:32,052
不敢相信  我居然紧张了
I can't believe... I'm feeling nervous.

239
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,088
长官  你会没事的
You're gonna do fine, sir.

240
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,028
谢谢你  蒂姆
Thank you, Tim.

241
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,072
不客气
You're welcome.

242
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:43,062
感觉像是总统并没有批准此事
So, it sounds to me like the president didn't actually authorize this.

243
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,021
严格地说  她是没有
Technically, no.

244
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,005
更像是个间接命令
It was more of an... an indirect order,

245
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,012
但是拉里  她希望我们这么做
But believe me, Larry, she wants this to happen.

246
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:50,078
她要和霍奇斯会面
She's gonna meet with Hodges,

247
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:52,072
我们要把燃料罐炸掉
And we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

248
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:56,068
拉里  你对这次行动有意见吗
Larry, do you have a problem with this?

249
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,065
事实上  没有
As a matter of fact, no.

250
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,012
没有任何意见
None whatsoever.

251
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,062
这些斯塔克伍德的杂种们竟敢招惹我的人
These Starkwood bastards drew on my men.

252
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,023
我盼着再进去跟他们干一场呢
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.

253
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,042
好的  让你的队伍原地待命
All right, have your teams hold their position

254
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,048
随时准备行动
And be ready to move.

255
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,098
相信我  爆炸时你会知道的
Believe me, you'll know when it happens.

256
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,032
好的
All right.

257
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:30,098
-托尼  我是杰克  听到没  -我在
- Tony, It's Jack. do you copy?  - Yeah, I'm here.

258
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,021
你说对了  那是导弹
You were right about the missiles.

259
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,008
总统证实了
The president confirmed it.

260
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,038
我们这次行动  必须秘密进行
We're gonna have to carry this out as a covert operation.

261
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,012
一旦导弹被销毁
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down Starkwood

262
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:38,075
拉里和他的部队就会封锁斯塔克伍德
As soon as the missiles have been destroyed.

263
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,082
-好  -托尼
- Good.  - Tony...

264
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:42,065
我要你干得神不知  鬼不觉
I need to know that you can do this without being detected.

265
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:44,025
霍奇斯已经下令
Hodges's given his men standing orders

266
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,046
出现任何形式违反协议的行为
To launch those missiles

267
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,087
立即发射导弹
if there's a breach of any kind.

268
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,068
我能做到
Yeah. I can do it.

269
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:50,055
祝你好运
Okay. Good luck.

270
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,062
好
Yeah.

271
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:06,055
这里完事了
We're done here.

272
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,078
我到周围巡逻下
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.

273
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,055
你不是才巡逻过吗
You said you just finished one.

274
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,098
我知道
I know.

275
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,032
但现在要加倍小心
But I don't think we can be too careful right now.

276
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,055
-喂  -是我
- yeah.  - It's me.

277
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,008
辅助罐已加满燃料做好准备了
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.

278
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,058
已确认
Confirmed.

279
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:43,028
我稍后就下来
I'll be down in a few minutes.

280
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,035
收到
Copy that.

281
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,088
不许动
Freeze!

282
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,095
举起手来
Let me see your hands.

283
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,065
阿尔梅达
Almeida.

284
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:57,098
把枪放在地上
Put your gun on the ground.

285
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,005
慢慢地
Slowly.

286
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,025
踢出去
Kick it.

287
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,032
把他拖到卡车下面
Drag him under the truck.

288
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,096
快点  去啊
Now! let's go!

289
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:27,082
举起手来
Hands up.

290
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,093
你知道自己在做什么吗
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,077
带我去燃料罐那里
You're going to take me down to the fuel tanks.

292
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,065
走吧
Let's go.

293
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,048
打开
Open it up.

294
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,037
进去
Go ahead.

295
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:29,093
总统现在可以接见你们了
President will see you now.

296
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,053
很好  谢谢
Very good. Thank you.

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,056
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges.

298
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,006
总统阁下
Madam President.

299
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:42,036
这位是格雷格·西顿
This is Greg Seaton,

300
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,070
我的助手
My associate.

301
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,017
他非同寻常
He's a remarkable man.

302
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,037
看起来不像
Doesn't look remarkable,

303
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,039
但是相信我  他是个天才
But believe me, he's a genius.

304
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:51,023
是啊  我认识西顿先生
Yes, I know Mr. Seaton.

305
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,069
没事了  先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

306
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,066
还是老样子  对吧
It never gets old, does it?

307
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:02,079
走进总统办公室
Stepping into the... the Oval Office.

308
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,083
几乎
Almost

309
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,079
能闻到历史的味道
Smells of history.

310
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:06,083
我们能坐下来吗
Can we sit?

311
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,086
请坐
Please.

312
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,013
自从您上任以来
You know, this is the first Time

313
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,016
我还是第一次到这办公室来
I've been in this room since you were elected?

314
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,056
这我知道
I'm aware of that, yes.

315
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,002
在前任总统执政期间
Under your predecessor,

316
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:19,009
我每两个月会来一次
I used to drop by every couple of months.

317
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:21,026
我会向丹尼尔斯总统
I'd brief President Daniels

318
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:24,043
报告世界上都发生了些什么
On what was really going on in the world.

319
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,093
而现如今你却失了宠被晾在了一边
And you've been excluded now.

320
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,016
就是因为这个吗
Is that what this is about?

321
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,099
不  阁下
No, ma'am.

322
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,043
是关于让斯塔克伍德
It's about allowing Starkwood

323
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,043
完成它的既定使命
To fulfill the purpose for which was founded

324
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,046
保卫这个国家
Protecting this country.

325
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:39,019
你一直都在攻击这个国家
You have been attacking this country.

326
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,086
你和朱玛将军
You and General Juma

327
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:43,086
杀害了数以百计的无辜民众
Have killed hundreds of innocent people,

328
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,093
包括我的儿子
Including my son.

329
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,010
总统阁下
Madam President,

330
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,079
对于您儿子的死  我深表遗憾
I'm deeply sorry for your loss,

331
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:56,026
同时我也为今天逝去的那些生命而心碎
And my heart breaks for all the lives that were taken today,

332
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,062
但您认为我和此事有关
But I'm shocked that you would think that I had anything

333
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:00,073
-让我很是震惊  -我们有证据
- To do with it.  - we have evidence

334
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
表明你和朱玛狼狈为奸
That you've been working with Juma.

335
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:06,039
您的情报部门辜负了您的期望
Your intelligence agencies have failed you.

336
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,026
如果我知道朱玛的阴谋诡计
If I had known what Juma was up to,

337
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,006
我会竭尽所能地去阻止他得逞
I would have done everything in my power to stop him.

338
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,046
不如我们把这些莫须有的控告放到一边
So let's push aside all these baseless accusations

339
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,046
说不定我们还可以精诚合作
And maybe we can do some business here.

340
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:18,053
我洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

341
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,049
总统阁下
Madam President,

342
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,049
我知道您是历史系毕业的
I know you're a student of history,

343
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,096
您肯定清楚地知道
And so you're well aware

344
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,096
我们国家是借助私人部队的协助
That our nation's independence was won

345
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,019
才取得了独立
With the aid of private armies,

346
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:32,036
没有他们就没有这个国家的今天
And we can't survive without them.

347
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,076
您看把生化武器带进国门是多么易如反掌
Look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country.

348
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,036
我们的国防不堪一击
Our defenses are fragile.

349
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,026
濒临崩溃
They're on the verge of collapse.

350
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,033
但亡羊补牢为时不晚
But it's not too late to do something about it.

351
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,053
那你有何高见呢
So what are you suggesting?

352
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,053
简言之
In short,

353
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,049
我想要个政府职位
I want a seat at the table.

354
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:50,022
斯塔克伍德要参与
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping

355
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:53,053
国内外军事政策的制定
Of military policy, domestic and global.

356
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:57,086
这听起来更像  你是想要第一把交椅
It sounds more like you want a seat at the head of the table.

357
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:01,003
总统阁下  我不是来篡权夺位的
Madam President, I'm not here to supplant your authority.

358
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,006
我是来提议精诚合作的
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

359
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:04,070
请考虑
Think of Starkwood

360
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,026
把斯塔克伍德作为军队的第五分支
As the fifth branch of the military.

361
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,036
格雷格
Greg?

362
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:15,026
这里包含了协议的基本条款
This contains the protocols that will serve as the basis of our agreement.

363
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,003
我建议咱们一起来看看
I suggest that we review them together.

364
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:22,003
乔纳斯  我同意会面
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting

365
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:24,096
是因为我想听听你想说些什么
Because I wanted to hear what you had to say.

366
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:27,079
但你的提议简直是敲诈勒索
But what you're proposing is blackmail.

367
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,073
您那是竟往最坏处想了啊
Well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.

368
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,026
你威胁说要杀害数以千计的平民
You are threatening to kill thousands of people.

369
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,059
我并不以此为荣
I'm not proud of this chapter.

370
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:42,039
我也第一次这样承认
I'm the first to admit it.

371
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,063
过去的就让它过去吧
And it's Time to turn the page.

372
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,063
今天这个国家经历了太多的血雨腥风
This country has seen enough bloodshed today.

373
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:48,063
总统阁下  为谋天下百姓之福祉
For the sake of the American people, Madam President,

374
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,009
我恳请您与我同舟共济
I implore you to work with me,

375
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:53,063
往日恩怨一笔勾销
And let's move past this.

376
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,083
请看文件  总统阁下
Pick up the document, Madam President.

377
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:28,069
我们走
Let's go.

378
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:30,035
快点起来  不然我把你留这了
Come on. get up now, or I'll leave you down here.

379
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,081
你不希望那样的  相信我  起来啊
And you don't want that, believe me. get up!

380
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,039
走
Let's go!

381
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,049
来啊
Come on!

382
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,016
怎么了
What is it?

383
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,096
代码363
Code 363.

384
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,026
我们该发射了
We're supposed to launch.

385
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,053
你确定不是错误警报
Are you sure it's not a false alarm?

386
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,066
无法判断
No way to tell.

387
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,046
但我们有作战命令
We've got standing orders, though.

388
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,026
启动发射序列
Let's start the launch sequence.

389
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,069
太迟了
Too late.

390
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,029
发射序列完成
Launch sequence complete.

391
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,029
输入开火密码
Enter the firing codes.

392
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,069
长官  我们得确认此事
Sir, we need to confirm this.

393
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,063
那不是标准程序
That's not the correct protocol.

394
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,099
我们会杀死一万人啊
We're about to kill 10,000 people.

395
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,093
我们应该打电话确认一下
We should get someone on the phone.

396
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,053
输入密码
Enter the codes.

397
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,056
马上
Now!

398
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,026
不行  长官
No, sir.

399
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,089
炸了  我们的人得手了  该咱们上场了
That's it. that's us. let's go.

400
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:53,006
出发
We're a go!

401
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:54,096
出发
We're a go!

402
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,063
他完成任务了
It's done.

403
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,099
托尼
Tony?

404
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,023
托尼  听到了吗
Tony, do you copy?

405
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,063
如此规模的爆炸可能短路了他的通讯设备
An explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his com.

406
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,003
我们只能等拉里和他的人进去后再说了
We're gonna have to wait for Larry and his men to move in.

407
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,063
上面写你想成为
It says here that you want

408
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,049
国防部战略计划组的核心成员
Active status in the Pentagon's Strategic Planning Group.

409
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,099
是的
That's correct.

410
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:32,086
那你就可以进入6级保密资料了
That would give you access to level 6 classified material.

411
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,069
即使副总统也没那个权限
Not even the vice president has that clearance.

412
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,004
这点没得商量
These points are nonnegotiable.

413
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:40,006
我不是来这跟你讨价还价的
I'm not here to debate them.

414
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,049
我们看下一部分关于
Let's review the next section,

415
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:45,096
参议院对斯塔克伍德外勤的监督权
Which concerns senate oversight of Starkwood field operations.

416
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,039
抱歉打扰  总统阁下
I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President

417
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,026
我得跟您说点事
But I need to speak with you.

418
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,039
等等可以吗
Can it wait?

419
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:52,036
总统阁下  必须现在
No, ma'am, it can't.

420
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,086
失陪一下
Will you excuse me for a moment?

421
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:55,093
当然
Of course.

422
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:08,013
通讯卫星刚刚探测到
Satcom has just detected

423
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:10,019
斯塔克伍德基地发生了剧烈的爆炸
A massive explosion on the Starkwood compound.

424
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:12,029
生化武器设备已经被销毁了
The bioweapons facility has been destroyed.

425
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,013
-确定吗  -是的  阁下
- Are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.

426
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,040
这么大规模的爆炸
Judging by the size of the explosion,

427
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,042
几乎可以摧毁任何东西
Nothing could have survived.

428
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,066
但我不清楚是谁做的  不是我们的人干的
But I don't know how this happened. This wasn't us.

429
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:20,033
让调查局把斯塔克伍德封锁起来
Call FBI and have them lock down Starkwood.

430
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,049
-他们已经行动了  -很好
- They're already moving in. - Good.

431
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,013
这事结束之后  我要跟杰克·鲍尔通话
And when this is over, I want to speak to Jack Bauer.

432
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,023
好的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:33,036
我没把握是否已说动她
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

434
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,004
我觉得您干得很棒  长官
I think you handled it perfectly, sir.

435
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,090
很快就能见分晓了
We'll see.

436
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,016
你们要干嘛
What the hell is this?

437
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:45,011
把这些材料作为证据
Put this document into evidence

438
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,026
把这两个人抓起来
And take these men into custody.

439
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,083
你想干什么  你疯了吗
What are you thinking? Have you lost your mind?

440
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,036
乔纳斯  你的导弹已经被我们摧毁了
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.

441
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,053
你玩完了
It's over.

442
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,006
不可能
That's impossible.

443
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,056
这是事实
It's the truth.

444
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,073
你被捕了
And you're under arrest.

445
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:03,016
你是个恐怖分子和杀人犯
You are a terrorist and a murderer

446
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,008
我要尽我一切所能
And I'm gonna do everything in my power

447
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:08,009
让你为犯下的罪行付出惨痛的代价
to make sure that you pay dearly for your crimes.

448
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:14,026
我唯一的罪过就是想保护我的祖国
My only crime is that I'm trying to protect my country!

449
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,009
你觉得逮捕我这事就完了吗
You think this ends with me?

450
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,029
我只是这次行动的冰山一角
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.

451
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:20,049
稍等
Hold on.

452
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:25,093
你将面对的  是你无法想象的对手
You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.

453
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:28,049
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

454
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,066
你会知道的

531
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:20,089
但是需要匹配的干细胞

疗效不确定  但这是杰克唯一的希望
It's a long shot, but it's the only hope he's got.

536
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:31,059

All right.

他们在说金·鲍尔吗
Didthey say something about Kim Bauer?

00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,069
是啊  她现在在调查局
Yeah, she's at FBI

539
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,009

他会好起来吗
So they think he's gonna be all right?

542
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:45,059
不容乐观
Didn't sound promising.

543
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,072
托尼  我也很为难
Listen, Tony, this isn't easy for me,

544
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,002
但是我接到命令  要求逮捕你
But, uh... I'm under orders to take you into federal custody.

545
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,027
我了解

546
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,035
你刚才的英勇壮举
You dida brave thing here.

547
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,055
救了几千条性命
Probably saved thousands of lives.

548
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:02,052
说真的
For the record,

549
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,034
我觉得这不是你应得的回报
I don't think this is how you should be repaid.

550
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,095
感谢你能这么说  不过
I appreciate that, but, uh...

551
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:10,075
我完全是咎由自取  是我活该

我会把你带回调查局
I'll be taking you back to FBI, all right?

555
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,059
这种病会一直伴有失忆的症状  鲍尔先生
Memory loss is consistent with the disease,Mr. Bauer.

556
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:27,065
但我没料到症状会出现地这么快
I just wouldn't have expected it to manifest this quickly.

557
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:30,052
不止是失忆
It's not just memory loss.

558
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:32,059
感觉好像
It feels like...

559
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,059
我不知该怎么说
I don't know exactly how to explain it.

560
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,089
我觉得
I feel like, uh,

561
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:43,025
就像我的部分机体丧失了能力
Like I'm losing some part of myself.

562

人格转变  有时还会产生幻觉
Personality changes, someTimes even hallucinations.

564
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,054
但这是一种武器化了的病原体
But this is a weaponized pathogen

565
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:52,094
我们对其了解微乎其微
We don't know much about.

566
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:54,085
军方现在还在桑加拉的生化武器
Military's still combing through the remains

567
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:56,039
实验室的废墟中展开彻底搜查
Of the bioweapons lab in Sangala,

568
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,012
很快我们就能更进一步地了解了
So we expect to learn something very soon.

569
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,095
你刚才给了我控制身体发抖的药
You were able to give me something that controlled the shaking.

570
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,055
能再给我一些防止失忆的药吗
Is there anything that you can give me that would help me with this?

571
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,012
没有
No.

572
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:09,033
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

573
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,059

579
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,075

保持清醒多久
Able to provide you with the details.

581
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,001
好吧
Okay.

582
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,065
我有点事要先对你讲
First, there's something that you need to know.

583
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,025
什么
What?

584
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,015
是金
It's about Kim.

585
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:47,065

00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,015
我告诉她你病了
I told her that you were sick

587
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:52,024
而且她可能有助于你的治疗
And that she might be able to help with the treatment.

你以为你是谁啊
Who the hell do you think you are?

592
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,006
你少自以为是
Who the hell do you think you are?

593
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:14,005
你觉得我好过吗
You think this is easy?

594
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:16,005
你以为你这样做很体贴吗
You think you understand what I'm going through?

595
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,012
你想错了
Because you don't.

596
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,056
我快不行了
I am dying.

597
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,055

And I was okay with it.

我还能独自承受这一切

你把她牵扯进来  这让我忍无可忍

-杰克  听我说  -不  你听我说

我特地警告过你不要把我女儿牵扯进来

每次得到了电话号码或者地址

我以为我远走高飞是为你好

是我拒你于千里之外
I pushed you away.

639
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,017
我不仅没有为我一生所犯的过错

640
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:23,037
而负起责任  反而责怪你
For all the mistakes I've made in my life, I blamed you.

641
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,074
我愚蠢至极

642
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080

这个治疗还在临床试验阶段
The treatment is experimental.

648
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,090
我觉得不可行
And I don't think it's going to work.

649
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:52,007
你不想这么做  因为你害怕来求我
And you don't want to because you're afraidto ask me.

650

Kim... I'm dying.

656
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:12,087
即便有能让我幸存的一线生机
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening

657
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:16,073
我也决不愿承受  让你坐在我身边
It is not worth the pain for me to let you

658
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:18,029
看着我死去时的那种切肤之痛
