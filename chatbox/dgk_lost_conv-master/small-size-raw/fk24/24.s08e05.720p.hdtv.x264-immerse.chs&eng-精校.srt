00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,013
《反恐24小时》  前情提要
Previously on 24

4
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:22,027
我哥哥情况如何
I need to know about my brother.

5
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:25,071
他还活着  快跑吧
He's alive. Get out now.

6
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:28,097
他们很快就会意识到你就是幕后黑手了
It can't be long before they realize it's you.

7
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,031
您快点回车里去
I need you to get back in the car.

8
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,021
您的弟弟参与策划了这次炸弹袭击
Your brother was involved with the attack.

9
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,051
他就是我们一直在找的内应
He's the insider we've been looking for.

10
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,084
怎么回事
What's going on?

11
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,064
尸体触发了危险物警报
The body triggered a Hazmat alarm.

12
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,091
是高浓缩铀
It's highly enriched uranium.

13
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,007
你的意思是它属于武器级别吗
You mean it's weapons-grade?

14
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,067
他到底怎么会接触到这种物质的
How the hell did he come into contact with that?

15
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,065
我想我知道怎么回事
I think I know the answer.

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,091
有个持有武器级浓缩铀的人去找过我弟弟
Someone approached my brother with weapons-grade uranium.

17
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:53,067
-谁  -此人能接触到前苏联废弃的核原料堆
- Who? - Someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpile.

18
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,051
你必须要在俄罗斯人把铀给我弟弟前找到他们
You must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother.

19
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,037
我要看你手里有浓缩铀棒的证据
I want proof that the rods exist,

20
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,072
不然你休想得到钱
or you will not be paid.

21
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:01,070
你要证据是吧
You want proof, huh?

22
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,017
跟我来
Come with me.

23
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,051
我的小儿子
My younger son,

24
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,047
他负责运输浓缩铀棒
he was transporting the rods,

25
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,081
但他太大意了
and he was careless.

26
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:10,084
看到了吧  这就是你要的证据了
There, you have your proof.

27
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,075
你在俄罗斯黑帮中做了近两年的卧底
You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,024
你的身份并未被揭穿
Your cover is still intact.

29
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,067
你的意思是让我打回内部去吗
Are you asking me to go back in?

30
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:21,011
沃克探员结束卧底工作已经六年多了
Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years.

31
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,011
我认为不应该让她来执行这个任务
I think you're making a mistake by putting her in.

32
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:26,057
你一定还有其他选择
You must have other options.

33
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:27,071
她是我们打入敌人内部的唯一途径
She's our only way in.

34
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:28,087
那好  我跟她一起去
Fine, then I want to go with her.

35
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:31,081
我猜你的计划是找人假扮成竞价的买主
I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy?

36
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:33,001
就由我来假扮买主好了
I'll act as a buyer.

37
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,041
我在找瓦德米尔
I'm looking for Vladimir.

38
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:36,087
瓦德失踪了
Vlad disappeared.

39
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,054
但你能找到他
But you can find him.

40
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,054
他们每时每刻都知道我在哪儿
They know where I am 24/7.

41
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,087
我和在监狱没什么两样
I'm still in prison.

42
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,041
假释期的追踪器
Parole bracelet?

43
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:45,004
我能把这玩意拿下来
I can get this off.

44
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:46,097
你不能割断追踪器
You can't cut bracelet.

45
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,011
我也没打算那样做
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

46
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,091
看你都干了些什么
What the hell have you done?!

47
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,024
够了  到此为止吧 
That's it, this is over.

48
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,041
杰克  对你来说结束了  而我才刚开始
Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.

49
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:02,098
以下事件发生于晚上八点到九点
The following takes place between 8:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M.

50
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:07,059
卡米斯坦伊斯兰共和国

51
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,097
今天的首都  忠于哈桑总统的军队

52
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:16,053
抓捕了很多意图颠覆政权的叛徒

53
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,007
政府的各个部门中都揪出了嫌犯

54
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:25,015
我还以为你不是死了就是给抓了呢
I thought you were dead or captured.

55
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,007
我好不容易才摆脱他们的追捕
It took me this long to get clear.

56
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,041
我和巴扎耶夫在一起
I'm with Bazhaev.

57
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:30,097
去他妈的巴扎耶夫
To hell with Bazhaev!

58
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,041
都是因为他  我们的努力才付之东流
Everything we have worked for, it's all over because of him.

59
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,017
你这就言之过早了  将军
It's not over, General.

60
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,051
当然都玩完了
Of course it is!

61
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,091
你的哥哥还活着
Your brother is still alive,

62
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,051
你的元首梦也破碎了
and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished.

63
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:44,010
现在他的卫队正全城搜捕我们
Now his security forces are rounding up our people all over the city.

64
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:47,047
就在五分钟前  阿米礼将军
General Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago,

65
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,027
在家人面前被逮捕了
in front of his wife and children.

66
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,075
美国人不会同意他这样继续下去
Look, the Americans won't let him continue.

67
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,069
会指责他侵犯了人权
They'll accuse him of human rights violations

68
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,071
并以退出和平会谈为威胁
and threaten to pull out of the peace talks.

69
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,044
等浓缩铀一到手
Once we have the uranium,

70
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,064
我哥哥就不再是问题了
my brother will become irrelevant anyway.

71
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,054
你被人四处追捕
You are being hunted like an animal.

72
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:03,017
怎么把浓缩铀拿到手
How do you expect to get the uranium?

73
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,057
巴扎耶夫可以帮我们拿到手
Bazhaev can deliver it to us,

74
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,074
但我需要先把钱打到他的账户上
but first I need payment wired to his account.

75
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,001
没事的
It's all right.

76
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,037
谢谢
Mm. Thank you.

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,064
爸爸  弗农山有个诊所
Papa, there's a clinic in Mt. Vernon.

84
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,011
我在那边找到了一个能治疗他的医生
I found a doctor who can treat him.

85
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,044
我们不是说好了吗
We have been through this.

86
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,077
不找医生
No doctors.

87
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,047
没错  但是这个医生有家小
Yes, but this one has a family.

88
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,047
我知道他们的名字和住址
I know where they are, I know their names.

89
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,051
我保证让他守口如瓶
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

90
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,044
你也能保证诊所里其他人不会发现吗
And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out?

91
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,094
保证别的医生  护士  任何人不泄密吗
Another doctor, a nurse, no one?

92
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:57,011
当局知道核原料的事情
The authorities know about the nuclear material

93
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,051
或者不久就会知道了
or they will soon enough,

94
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,091
他们会四处查找的
and they'll be looking everywhere.

95
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:03,027
把欧力格送医会引狼入室
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

96
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:06,087
如果我们不赶紧把他送医的话他会死的
He's going to die if we don't get him help.

97
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:09,071
那让他死好了
Then he's going to die.

98
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,014
但让他如此孤单地死在
But alone like this?

99
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:18,037
厨房后面冰冷的屋子里吗
In a cold room behind the kitchen?

100
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,037
他是我的弟弟  爸爸
He's my brother, Papa,

101
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,076
也是您的儿子啊
and he's your son.

102
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,097
好吧
All right.

103
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,034
把他带去郊区别墅
Take him to the country house.

104
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:34,047
乌兰娜会照顾他的
Ulana will look after him.

105
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,019
谢谢  爸爸
Thank you, Papa.

106
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,001
什么事
What is it?

107
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,031
法哈德找你
Farhad is asking for you.

108
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,074
有新消息吗
You have news for me?

109
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,011
是的
Yes.

110
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,077
钱马上就汇到你的账户了
The money will be transferred to your account shortly.

111
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:01,051
什么时候给我浓缩铀棒
When can I take possession of the rods?

112
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:04,034
钱一到就给你
As soon as we have the money.

113
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,014
给我五个小时
Five hours.

114
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,012
很好
Good.

115
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:11,064
我帮你打发时间吧
I'll help you pass the time.

116
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,094
有特殊偏好吗
You have a preference?

117
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:23,097
没
No.

118
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,081
那两个都归你吧
Then take both.

119
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:40,061
他还在出血
He's still bleeding out.

120
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:43,047
这个应该可以止血的
This should cauterize the wound.

121
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,061
好了
Okay, it's working.

122
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,043
你打给谁
Who are you calling?

123
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,011
-黑斯廷斯  -为什么
- Hastings. - Why?

124
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:55,041
我要让他取消这次行动
Because I'm shutting this operation down.

125
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,081
你还没准备好出外勤  这就是证据
You shouldn't be in the field, and this proves it.

126
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,007
只能赌上这一把了  杰克
This was the only play, Jack.

127
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,031
换你也会这么做的
You would've done the same thing.

128
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:00,084
放手一搏的目的是让他合作
The play was to get him to cooperate.

129
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,081
-他会合作的  -你怎么知道
- He will cooperate. - How do you figure?

130
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,041
我了解这帮人  杰克
Look, I know these guys, Jack.

131
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:07,054
兹亚除了幼女之外  最爱的就是钱了
The only thing that Ziya likes more than 13-year-old girls is money.

132
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,031
让他赚这么一大笔  他死都愿意
He'd have butchered himself for a score like this.

133
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,097
是啊  但黑斯廷斯仍需要知道真相
Yeah, well, Hastings still needs to know the truth.

134
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:13,064
就是你状态一点也不稳定
That you're unstable!

135
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:23,071
听着  我不怪你
Look... I don't blame you

136
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,047
毕竟你经历了这么多坎坷
after everything you've been through,

137
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,097
但是你不适合这个任务
but you are not fit for this mission.

138
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,077
我的确有过一段艰辛坎坷的日子
I went through a rough patch, yeah,

139
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,061
但我从低谷中走了出来
but I came out on the other side.

140
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,034
我可不这么认为
And I don't think you have.

141
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,017
不管怎么说  
The bottom line is,

142
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:40,011
我还是帮你们夺取浓缩铀的最佳人选
I'm still the best chance that anyone has of intercepting that uranium,

143
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:41,064
我现在就能做到
and I can do it now.

144
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:49,067
现在怎样  你还打电话吗
So, what's it going to be, you making that phone call or what?

145
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,020
他快醒了  杰克
He's waking up, Jack.

146
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,030
赶紧决定吧
Better make up your mind.

147
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,091
好吧
Fine.

148
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,031
看你能问出什么来
You see what you can get out of him.

149
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:16,067
但别忘了  我都听得见
But don't forget, I'm listening.

150
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,027
闭嘴  兹亚
Shut up, Ziya.

151
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,037
我们一出去就给你止痛药
You'll get your painkillers as soon as we get out of here.

152
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,061
-你都做了些什么  -我帮你拿下了追踪器
- What did you do?! - I got the bracelet off,

153
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:40,027
帮了你一个忙啊
all right, I did you a favor.

154
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,031
你这个疯婊子  把我拇指切掉了
You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb!

155
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,084
木已成舟
Look, what's done is done.

156
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:47,017
要么你在这像婴儿一样哭嚎抱怨
You can either stay here and whine about it like a baby,

157
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:49,067
要么你跟我来大赚一笔
or you can come with me and be a rich man.

158
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:53,044
我可以从总收入里给你分成
Look, I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top.

159
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:56,031
是很大的一笔钱啊  兹亚
It's a lot of money, Ziya.

160
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,064
多少
How much?

161
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,014
250万
Two-and-a-half million.

162
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:02,021
事成后  300万也说不定
Maybe three when it's all done.

163
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,018
200万
Two million?

164
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,064
真的吗
You're serious?

165
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,007
你说呢
You tell me.

166
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,058
我把这笔买卖介绍给瓦德米尔
I take this deal to Vladimir,

167
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,041
如果是骗局  你知道后果吗
and it's not real, you know what happens?!

168
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,034
如果是骗局我又何必过来
Why would I be here if this wasn't real?!

169
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,061
算了  兹亚
Fine, forget it, Ziya.

170
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:21,091
我会自己找到瓦德米尔的
I'll find Vladimir my own way.

171
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:23,031
不  等等
No, wait!

172
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,054
我不知道他的确切位置
I don't know where he is exactly,

173
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,091
不过知道他可能去哪
but where he might be.

174
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,049
说
Tell me.

175
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,097
现在不是时候  我一会儿带你去
No, I'll take you there myself.

176
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,034
你有车吗
You have a car?

177
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,077
我有辆货车  停在后面
I have truck; it's parked out back.

178
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,021
好吧  我来开
All right, I'll drive.

179
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,041
起来
Come on!

180
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,037
喂
Yeah?

181
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,087
杰克  我刚刚在背景资料里发现
Jack, I just found out in my background check

182
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:46,071
兹亚还有个假释官
that Ziya has a probation officer.

183
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,077
-你要怎么处理  -没必要管了
- How do you want to handle this? - You don't need to.

184
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,004
他还戴着假释期追踪器
He has a tracking bracelet.

185
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,027
现在没了
Not anymore.

186
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,064
我不明白
I don't understand.

187
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,034
这东西有反干预系统
Those things have anti-tamper mechanisms.

188
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,041
你们不可能取下它而不触动警报
You can't cut them off him without triggering an alarm.

189
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,071
是  但相信我  已经处理好了
Yeah, well, trust me, it's been taken care of.

190
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,057
杰克  那儿发生了什么
Jack, what happened in there?

191
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,071
蕾妮得到她想要的结果了
Renee got the result she wanted.

192
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,067
兹亚会带她去瓦德米尔那里
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.

193
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:08,014
丹娜还在伪造你的档案
Dana's still working on your cover profile.

194
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,074
好了  他们走了
Okay, they're moving.

195
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,007
档案好了我给你电话
I'll call you when it's ready.

196
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,049
杰克还在等剩下部分的档案
Jack's still waiting on the rest of that profile.

197
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:29,087
我还在处理时间表  告诉他我快好了
I'm still working the timeline. Tell him I'm almost finished.

198
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,044
好的
Okay.

199
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,016
家中来电
Home

200
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,084
你不接吗
Aren't you going to get that?

201
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,084
是  我正准备接
Yeah, probably should.

202
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,013
喂
Hello?

203
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,087
我在忙
I'm in the middle of something.

204
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:46,041
稍等
Hold on a second.

205
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,064
克罗伊  我尽快传给你那个档案
Chloe, I will send that profile to you as soon as I'm done.

206
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,084
好的
Okay.

207
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,007
我告诉过你别再打过来
I told you not to call.

208
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,061
是  我知道你告诉过我
Yeah, I know what you told me.

209
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,074
但由于我身在你的公寓里的缘故
But now that I'm here in your apartment,

210
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,017
我就是情不自禁地想你
I just can't help but miss you.

211
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:06,021
我到早上就下班了  到时候我去见你
My shift is over in the morning. I will see you then.

212
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,037
那不行  现在就来
Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it?

213
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,001
我现在很忙  卡文
I'm right in the middle of something, Kevin.

214
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,061
你要是不相信我就看看新闻
Turn on the news if you don't believe me.

215
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,094
那不关我的事
Hey, that's not my problem.

216
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,054
我要见你
Okay, I need to see you.

217
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:17,064
-给你十五分钟  -这不可能啊
- You have 15 minutes. - That's not possible.

218
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,004
好吧  那就三十分钟
Okay, you got 30.

219
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,064
谁说我不通情达理来着
Who said I can't be reasonable?

220
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,028
卡文
Kevin...

221
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,074
别逼我打给你的小男友
Don't make me call that little boyfriend of yours.

222
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,024
让他美好的生活见鬼去吧
Rock his perfect little world.

223
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,077
老兄  恭喜你订婚了
"Hey, pal, congratulations on the engagement."

224
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,057
顺便说下  她不叫丹娜·沃什
"By the way, her name's not Dana Walsh,"

225
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:34,021
而是珍妮·斯科特
"it's Jenny Scott."

226
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:36,007
对了  我说过她有前科吗
"Oh, did I mention that she's an ex-con?"

227
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,014
不  不  没什么大不了
"No, no, no, nothing too serious."

228
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:40,000
只是个谋杀犯的同伙而已啦
"Just accessory to murder is all."

229
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:43,027
你还在吗
You still there?

230
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:45,077
是的
Yeah, I'm here.

231
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:47,057
待会见
See you soon.

232
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,006
阿洛  能求你点事吗
Arlo, can I ask you something?

233
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,031
问吧  星期六晚上我有空
Yes, I'm available Saturday night,

234
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,057
如果你有需要  我周五也行
and I can change my plans for Friday if you want.

235
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,054
或者星期四也有空
Also, I'm free on Thursday.

236
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:04,071
抱歉  阿洛
Look, Arlo, I'm sorry.

237
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:06,054
我家里刚刚有点事
It's just, a situation's come up,

238
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:08,021
所以我得回家一趟
and I have to go home for a while.

239
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,081
丹娜  我们现在正处于非常时期
Dana, we're in the middle of a major protocol.

240
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,044
我知道  但是我保证不会去太久
I understand that, and I won't be long, I promise.

241
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,047
但需要你帮我做下我的工作
But I need you to cover for me.

242
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:17,034
完成蕾妮·沃克和杰克·鲍尔的卧底档案
Put the finishing touches on the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.

243
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,041
如果我问你回去干什么  你会说
And if I ask what this is about, you'll tell me...

244
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,087
-这不关你的事  -一我想也是
- That it's none of your business. - Right. I thought so.

245
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,061
你尽快完成然后传给克罗伊
Send it to Chloe's screen as soon as you're finished.

246
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:25,064
好
Okay.

247
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,047
谢谢  阿洛  算我欠你一次
Thank you, Arlo. I owe you one.

248
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,097
一次什么
One what?

249
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,067
谢谢  总理先生
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

250
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,091
期待明天和您的会面
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

251
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,064
我和十二国首脑谈过了
I've spoken to 12 heads of state.

252
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:02,093
他们有些担心
They're concerned,

253
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:05,053
不过还是准备参加明天的签字仪式
But they're all still planning to attend the signing ceremony tomorrow.

254
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,071
我有一个坏消息
Well, I've got some bad news.

255
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:10,002
很明显  刺杀哈桑总统只是
Apparently, killing president Hassan

256
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,051
他弟弟计划的一部分
was only part of his brother's plan.

257
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:12,088
反恐小组现在可以肯定
CTU now believes

258
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:15,058
他现在还在试图弄到武器级别的铀
he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium.

259
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,009
从谁手里得到
From whom?

260
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,000
一个在纽约的俄罗斯犯罪团伙
A Russian crime syndicate here in New York.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,022
一半的人都属前苏联军人或是克格勃间谍
Half of them are ex-Soviet Army or KGB.

262
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,076
如果有任何人能弄到极度危险的核原料堆
If anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles...

263
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,080
自冷战以后  我们就一直忧心忡忡
It's what we've been afraid of since the Wall came down.

264
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,021
哈桑总统知道这事吗
Is President Hassan aware of this?

265
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,087
就是他告诉反恐小组的
He's the one who told CTU about it.

266
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:33,093
黑斯廷斯已展开一次卧底计划
Director Hastings has already initiated an undercover operation

267
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:36,052
在其走私到其他国家前夺回浓缩铀
to try to recover the uranium before it's smuggled out of the country.

268
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:39,032
核原料现在就在美国本土吗
The nuclear materials are here on U.S. Soil?

269
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,009
-他们确定吗  -恐怕是的
- Are they sure? - Afraid so.

270
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,082
伊桑  你为什么问哈森总统是否知情
Ethan, you asked if President Hassan was aware of this. Why?

271
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:48,069
这就解释了伊斯兰共和国的现状了
Helps explain what's been going on in the Islamic Republic.

272
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,002
我刚和驻伊斯兰共和国的大使谈过
I just spoke with our ambassador in the I.R.K.

273
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,042
哈桑的卫队正横扫首都
Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital,

274
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:58,019
逮捕反对党领导人 关闭新闻机构
arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations.

275
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,072
他宣布全城戒严了吗
Has he declared martial law?

276
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:02,075
官方虽未宣布  但是实际上已经在做了
Not officially, but effectively, that's exactly what he's been doing.

277
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,012
这也怪不得他
Who can blame him?

278
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,025
我是说  他的弟弟肯定还有同伙的
I mean, his brother can't have been acting alone.

279
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:09,079
我们希望哈桑镇压他政府内的死硬派
We want Hassan cracking down on hardliners in his own government.

280
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:12,012
但现在他是公然挑衅国家法律
Except that he's defying his country's laws,

281
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,032
以及国际人权公约啊
as well as his international human rights obligations.

282
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:18,009
如果他继续的话  会威胁到和平公约的合法性
And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord.

283
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,059
哈桑总统从反恐小组回来了吗
Is President Hassan back yet from CTU?

284
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:22,019
十分钟之后到
He'll be here in ten minutes.

285
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:24,061
我要单独和他谈谈
I want to speak to him... alone.

286
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:26,079
我来安排
I'll take care of it.

287
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,095
够了
That's enough.

288
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,082
你怎么管那么多
What's your problem?

289
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,002
我要你头脑清醒
I need you thinking clearly.

290
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,089
你说过要给我止痛药的
You tell me you'd get me real painkiller.

291
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,062
把酒收起来
Put it away.

292
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,012
我很惊讶
I'm surprised.

293
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,063
他那样对待你之后  你还给他介绍买卖
I'm surprised you take deal to him again after what he did to you.

294
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:03,093
还有多远
How much further?

295
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,095
好
Okay.

296
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:08,005
你不愿意谈瓦德米尔
You don't want to talk about Vladimir.

297
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,009
我理解  不怪你
I understand. I don't blame you.

298
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:16,035
毕竟  这样一个男人还有什么好说的
After all, what is there to say about such a man?

299
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,049
没有好事  没有...
Nothing good, nothing very...

300
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,090
你赶紧告诉我
Just tell me

301
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,045
还有多远
how much further.

302
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,059
十分钟
Ten minute.

303
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,072
真开不起玩笑
Touchy, touchy.

304
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,022
喂
Yeah?

305
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,005
阿洛刚把你俩伪装身份的档案关联好了
Arlo just locked your cover profile.

306
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,075
我现在传给你
I'm uplinking it to you now.

307
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,085
好  稍等
Okay, hold on one sec.

308
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,022
好了  我收到了
Okay, I got it.

309
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,073
我们通话时蕾妮听不到的  对吗
Hey, you're taking me out of Renee's comm when you call, right?

310
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,022
对
Yes.

311
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,019
好  我要你进入她和瓦德米尔
Okay, I want you to go into her undercover file

312
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,055
有关联的卧底档案
with regards to Vladimir Laitanan.

313
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,025
我要搞清他们之间发生过的一切
I need to know everything that happened between them.

314
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,059
我稍后给你回复
I'll call you right back.

315
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,029
好  多谢
Okay, thanks.

316
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:07,001
总统阁下
Mr. President.

317
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:09,024
您的参谋长跟我说情况紧急
Your chief of staff said it was urgent.

318
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,035
确实如此  但首先
It is, but first,

319
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,097
我想再次表达对您能安然无恙而甚感欣慰
I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right.

320
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,095
您若是指关于我的卫队
If this is about my security forces

321
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:20,072
以及我在我国所采取的必要手段的话
and the necessary steps I'm taking back home,

322
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:22,051
那就恕难从命了
I'm afraid I can't help you.

323
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:28,054
您真有那个必要采取如此手段吗
Are you so sure they're necessary?

324
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:31,034
今天所发生的一切不亚于一次政变
What happened today was nothing short of a coup.

325
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:33,017
就是这同一批家伙
These same people

326
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:36,011
企图重新启动我国的核武器计划
are trying to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program.

327
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,031
我明白  但是...
I understand, but...

328
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,061
不  我认为你不明白
No, I don't think you do.

329
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,017
贵国是一个开放社会  总统阁下
Yours is an open society, Madam President,

330
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:43,087
一个法治的国度
governed by the rule of law.

331
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,087
我的国家却很闭塞
Mine is closed.

332
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,094
那里真正的法律便是强权
The only real law is power.

333
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:53,032
对我而言  若有半点软弱可欺就必死无疑
Any perceived weakness on my part, and I'm finished.

334
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,087
我明白您所处的复杂处境  总统阁下
I'm aware of the complexities of your situation, Mr. President.

335
00:15:56,091 --> 00:16:00,031
我兄弟想置我于死地
My brother tried to kill me,

336
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,041
而帮凶竟然是我自己的手下
helped by elements within my own government.

337
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:07,057
我必须清理门户
Those elements must now be purged.

338
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,057
清理门户
Purged?

339
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,096
你是说  处决吗
You mean, executed?

340
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,074
这是唯一能让我的子民开窍的方式
It is the only thing my people understand.

341
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,096
总统阁下  如果你违背自己的人权宣言
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President,

342
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:21,020
我是不能对你担保的
if you renege on your human rights obligations.

343
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,046
全世界都相信你是因为我相信你
The world is trusting you because I trust you.

344
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,035
你要我宽恕我的敌人
You're asking me to show mercy to enemies

345
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:29,005
而那些人却想毁了我
who are trying to destroy me.

346
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:32,052
我是让你以帮一个祖祖辈辈
I am asking you to find a middle way,

347
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:34,083
不知和平为何物的国度带去和平为名
in the name of bringing peace to a region

348
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,046
开辟出一条折中的道路
that hasn't known peace for generations.

349
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,082
我现在要去见我的家人了
I need to see my family now.

350
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,022
我找到位医生
I found a doctor.

351
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,052
什么医生
A doctor?

352
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:11,029
一个受控于我又可以医治你的人
Someone who can help you, someone we can control,

353
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,092
但爸爸说这太冒险了
but Papa says it's too risky.

354
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,079
爸爸是对的
Papa's right.

355
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:17,079
让你自生自灭也是对的吗
Condemning you to death?

356
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:20,022
我可不这么想
I don't believe that.

357
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:24,002
一切... 都是我咎由自取
What happened... was my own fault.

358
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,062
别因为我的失误而拖累整个家庭
The family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake.

359
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,076
知道吗  这些年来我觉得人生如戏
You know, all these years, I thought it was an act.

360
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,076
但你的确是好样的  对吗
But you really are the good son, aren't you?

361
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,098
我和你相差无几  约瑟夫
I'm no better or worse than you, Josef.

362
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,098
你是我大哥
You're my older brother.

363
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,062
你总是很照顾我
You've always looked out for me.

364
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,016
约瑟夫  约瑟夫  你想干嘛
Joseph? Joseph, what are you doing?!

365
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,039
我要带你去看医生
I'm taking you to the doctor.

366
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,041
但爸爸说我们不能去就医
But Papa said we can't.

367
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,095
我才不管爸爸说过什么
I don't care what Papa said!

368
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:59,035
我不会让你毫无抗争就这么死去
I'm not letting you die without a fight.

369
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,057
你长大了  可以自己拿主意了
You are old enough to make your own decisions.

370
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,020
我决定留下
I've decided to stay.

371
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,096
随你所愿吧
As you wish.

372
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,066
你也应该留下来
You should stay, too.

373
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,093
我不能
I can't.

374
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:31,065
为什么不  
Why not?

375
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:34,002
你对你父亲的看法只是单方面的
You think that your father is one way,

376
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:36,010
但是他不是你想的那样
but he's not what you think.

377
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,020
别那么说
Stop doing that.

378
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,003
-你总是那么说  -什么
- You always do that. - What?

379
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,086
含沙射影  但你从不告诉我你的真实想法
Imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean.

380
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:45,086
那样做是有好处的  相信我  凯拉
It is better that way, Kayla believe me.

381
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,033
我不想怂恿你和你父亲作对
I don't want to poison you against your father.

382
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:53,043
看  你又来了
There. You're doing it again.

383
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:54,079
你连自己的毛病都改不了
You can't help yourself.

384
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,066
什么又来了
Doing what again?

385
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:57,002
爸爸
Father!

386
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,020
你没事吧
Oh, are you all right?

387
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:01,042
我们以为...
We thought that...

388
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,004
知道  我知道
I know, I know.

389
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:08,069
凯拉  我要跟你母亲单独谈谈
Kayla, I need to speak to your mother now alone.

390
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,006
好
Okay.

391
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:26,047
-达莉亚  -我们没什么好谈的
- Dalia? - We have nothing to say to each other.

392
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:30,073
你爱她吗
Do you love her?

393
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,060
都结束了
It's over.

394
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:35,020
我跟她已经说清楚了
I ended it.

395
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,044
你还没回答我的问题
You didn't answer the question.

396
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,060
说实话吧  哪怕就一次
Be honest for once.

397
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:41,010
给我一点尊重
Show me a little respect.

398
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,037
我是你的妻子  该死
I'm your wife, damn it.

399
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,037
你爱她吗
Do you love her?

400
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,020
或许  我想我爱过她
Maybe I thought I did.

401
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,057
那就坦白吧
Then say it.

402
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,024
现在说这个还有什么意义
What does it matter now?

403
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,020
对我来说有意义
It matters to me.

404
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,064
真相是...
The truth is...

405
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,027
我只是很高兴我还能有那种感觉
...I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything.

406
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,024
难道是我的错  你居然敢那么认为
And that's my fault somehow? How dare you!

407
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:09,007
我们都有错
Our fault.

408
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,030
互相指责得也够多了
There's enough blame to go around.

409
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:13,077
达莉亚  求你别走
Dalia, please don't go.

410
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,044
-什么  -我不想让你离开我
- What? - I don't want you to leave.

411
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,084
别担心
Don't worry.

412
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,060
我不会大吵大闹的
I won't make a scene.

413
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:27,044
这件事后你应该更了解我才对
You should know me better than that by now.

414
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,080
我弟弟是个叛徒
My brother's a traitor.

415
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,037
身为我手下的最高官员居然密谋推翻我
My highest officers are conspiring against me.

416
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,034
而现在泰勒总统居然也威胁我要退出和平会谈
And now President Taylor is threatening to pull out of the peace talks.

417
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:44,060
你已经很久没向我征询意见了
It has been a long time since you've asked my advice about anything.

418
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:48,024
你总能给我最好的建议
You were the one who always gave me the best counsel.

419
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:52,010
谢谢你还能记得这点
Thank you for remembering that.

420
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:54,024
那你会留下吗
Then you'll stay?

421
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,087
太晚了  奥马
It's too late for that, Omar.

422
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,030
我们之间发生了太多的事
Too much has happened between us.

423
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:18,037
-达莉亚  -我很遗憾
- Dalia... - I'm sorry.

424
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:47,060
-瓦德在这活动吗  -有时会
- Vlad operates out of here? - Sometimes.

425
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:49,034
他总是打一枪换一个地方
He moved around a lot.

426
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:51,074
这就是条子在这总找不到他的原因
That's why cops don't find him inside here.

427
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,095
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go.

428
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,034
兹亚
Hey, Ziya?

429
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:58,057
你知道  瓦德米尔从不喜欢惊喜
You know, Vladimi was never fond of surprises,

430
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,014
所以我想
so I was thinking...

431
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:02,077
应该让你先进去
maybe you could go in first?

432
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,067
让他见我时心里有所准备
Get him used to the idea of me again.

433
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,067
先吊他的胃口吗
Whet his appetite?

434
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,037
-很对  -好的
- Exactly. - Okay.

435
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:20,093
我俩的伪造档案到位了吗
Is our cover in place?

436
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:22,056
到位了  克罗伊全搞定了
Yeah. Chloe got me everything.

437
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:24,079
好  我们开始温习墨西哥城的伪造经历吧
Good. Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City.

438
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:26,049
我们怎么遇见的  我们的交易对象是谁
How we met, who we dealt with.

439
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,089
先告诉我一些瓦德米尔的事
First tell me about Vladimir.

440
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:29,093
你想要知道些什么
What do you want to know?

441
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:31,096
他对你做过什么  我听见兹亚说的了
What he did to you? I heard what Ziya said.

442
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,052
兹亚
Ziya?

443
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:35,056
得了吧  杰克  他不过是小题大做罢了
Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen.

444
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,016
该死  蕾妮  这次任务我负责
Damn it, Renee, I am running this!

445
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,039
别再跟我兜圈子了
Stop messing with me!

446
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:39,072
我负责你的安全
I'm responsible for your safety.

447
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,029
所以我问什么
So, when I ask you a straight question,

448
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,052
你就答什么
you give me a straight answer.

449
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,019
听着  什么也没有  行了吧
Look, it was nothing, all right?

450
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:46,086
六年前我就搞定过他  现在也一样
I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today.

451
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:48,036
我只担心一件事
The only thing that I am worried about

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,076
巩固我们之间的伪造身份  所以  拜托你

别再在瓦德米尔身上浪费时间了

五年了  你现在来和我谈生意
Five years! And now you walk into my place of business?

472
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,091
你还在假释期间
You're on probation!

473
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,098
不  不再是了  瓦德
No. Not anymore, Vlad.

00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,098

00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,095
这就是我想告诉你的  是蕾妮

478
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,048
蕾妮·扎丹

她到我那里去找你

还有她说  她有个买家

481
00:23:57,098 --> 00:23:59,058
一个你会有兴趣的买家

482
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,001
而且这生意对我们都有好处
That it'd be good for all of us.

483
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,031
有百利而无一害
It'd be worth it for all of us.

484
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,031
蕾妮
Renee.

485
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:05,014
是的
Dah.

486
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:09,011
她有说五年来她都在哪吗
She say where she'd been these last five years?

487
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:12,055
她和其他人一样
Uh, where everybody else was.

488
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,055
在蹲监狱
In jail.

489
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:15,018
之后她去了墨西哥城
Then she go to Mexico City.

490
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,008
她说在那里逮到机会
She say she got the opportunity there.

00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,075
墨西哥城吗
Mexico City, huh?

492
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:21,075
是的  你怎么想的  卢戈
Dah. What do you think, Lugo?

493
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,088
你相信这垃圾的鬼话吗
You believe this piece of dirt?

494
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,091
我当然相信他
Sure I believe him.

495
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,068
他这种蠢货怎么编得出这种故事
He's too stupid to make up a story like that.

496
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,005
但我不太相信她
It's her I don't believe.

497
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,008
应该说我从没信过她
I never did.

498
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,091
我告诉过你  卢戈  不会是她
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.

499
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,040
她不是那种会出卖我们的人
She's not the one who sold us out.

500
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,026
她莫名其妙地出现在我们面前
She shows up out of the blue,

501
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,043
16个月后  我们遭遇联邦探员的严打
then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats.

502
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,023
我只是说说而已  瓦德
I'm just saying, Vlad.

503
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:44,007
你只是说说
You were just saying.

504

-蕾妮在哪  -在外面
- Where's Renee now? - Outside.

00:24:56,097 --> 00:25:00,000
把脸擦干净  带她来见我
Clean yourself up. Bring her to me.

506
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:19,049
阿洛  丹娜人呢
Arlo, where's Dana?

507
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:21,052
-她不在她的办公桌前  -她回家了
- She isn't at her desk. - She went home.

508
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,035
回家了
Home?

509
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:24,091
对
Yeah.

510
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:36,080
是谁
Who is it?

511
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,087
是我
It's me.

512
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,093
你把我钥匙拿去了
You have my key.

513
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:43,016
百忙之中还抽空来看我
Nice of you to drop by.

514
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,054
这不好笑
It's not funny.

515
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,047
你搞什么  他是谁
What the hell?! Who's he?

516
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:53,044
是我博蒙镇的哥们
It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont.

517
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,047
让他滚出去
Get him the hell out of here.

518
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,047
你知道我不能这么做  珍妮
You know I can't do that, Jen.

519
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,050
我已经答应他可以让他留下了
I already told him he could stay.

520
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,094
再赶他走就太不礼貌了
It'd be impolite.

521
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,084
拿着
Here.

522
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,012
这是什么
What's this?

523
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:14,031
这里有五百块
It's $500.

524
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:16,037
这是我能从提款机里提取的全部现金了
It's all I could get out of the cash machine.

525
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,051
明天早上再给你另外五百块
I'll get you another 500 in the morning.

526
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:30,031
你觉得就你聪明
You think you're smart,

527
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:33,034
其他人都是傻子是吧
and the whole world's stupid.

528
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:35,077
你想就这么算了可不行  珍妮
That's just not how it is, Jen.

529
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:37,067
我没觉得你是傻子
I don't think you're stupid.

530
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:40,077
没有吗  那你怎么还想用一千块把我打发走
No? But you think you can buy me off with $1,000?

531
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:42,014
我没说把你打发走
I'm not trying to buy you off.

532
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,011
别这样
No, no.

533
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:46,024
你到底想从我这得到什么
What do you want from me?

534
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:48,041
你知道我想要什么吗
You know what I want?

535
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:50,027
我真正想要的
What I really want

536
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:52,034
就是你别再像对待白痴一样对我
is for you to stop treating me like some dumbass,

537
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:55,061
当我是才19岁的飞车党小毛贼吗
19-year-old stickup artist with a fast car!

538
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:59,057
别以为就你长大了
You're not the only one who's grown up.

539
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:02,044
别冲动  卡文
Easy, Kevin, easy.

540
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,047
我等这一刻很久了
I've been waiting for this moment.

541
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:09,007
做梦都在想着
Dreaming about it.

542
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,064
这是你欠我的
You owe me.

543
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:18,014
如果你觉得是我出庭作证告发你的  我没有
If you think that I testified against you, I didn't.

544
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:23,041
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me!

545
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,011
我没撒谎
I'm not lying to you!

546
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:26,059
我确实比你早出狱
I got out of jail before you did,

547
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,034
但仅仅是因为我犯案时还未成年
yeah, but only because I went in as a minor.

548
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,074
而不是其他的原因
No other reason.

549
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,027
事实上
The truth is,

550
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:37,091
说什么也无济于事
it doesn't change things,

551
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:39,071
无论什么理由
one way or another.

552
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,044
我已经调查过你了
See, I've done my homework.

553
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:43,044
我知道你是干什么工作的
I know what your job is.

554
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,087
我是数据分析师  仅此而已
I'm a data analyst, nothing more.

555
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:49,031
对  但你是反恐小组的数据分析师
Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU.

556
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,081
你有渠道可以搞到很多好东西
You got access to all sorts of good stuff--

557
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:56,014
比如银行密码啊  港务局货单什么的
bank codes, port authority manifests,

558
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,011
还有股票交易什么的
stock exchange.

559
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:00,067
我是有渠道  但不是所有的渠道
Access, yeah, but not unrestricted access.

560
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,034
你会想办法搞到的
You'll figure something out.

561
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,094
你总会有办法的
You always do.

562
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:05,081
我不管你给我什么
But whatever it is,

563
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,087
但必须得值至少六位数  懂了吗
the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay?

564
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:23,092
求你了  卡文
Please, Kevin.

565
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:34,022
好吧  听好了
Okay, here's the deal.

566
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:37,099
你只帮我这一次
You do this one thing for me,

567
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:40,003
我就立马消失
and I'm gone.

568
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:44,006
两不相欠  再也不来打扰你
I'll never bother you again.

569
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,092
我办不到
I can't.

570
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:58,019
你当然能
You can.

571
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,053
而且你肯定能
And you will.

572
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,070
从去年八月起  我们一直活动并下榻于
Since last August, we've been living and operating out of a hotel

573
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,016
亚文尼达·华雷斯大道上的贝拉诺谢酒店
called Bella Noche on Avenida Juarez.

574
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:12,058
那是一家专门为高端犯罪提供庇护场所的酒店
Yeah, it's been set up as a safe haven for high-end criminal activity.

575
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,041
不会留记录的  名字记住了吗
They don't keep records. Have you got the name?

576
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,054
贝拉诺谢酒店  记住了
Bella Noche. I got it.

577
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,028
好  我会一直监听  边听边告诉你细节
Okay, I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details.

578
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:20,044
听好我说的就行
Just listen to my voice.

579
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,011
我会告诉你所有需要的信息
I'll get you all the information you need.

580
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:24,038
他来了
He's coming.

581
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,004
下车  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

582
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,078
说
Yeah?

583
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,088
事情可不太妙  杰克
It's not pretty, Jack.

584
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,031
她的问题很严重
She had a real problem on her hands.

585
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:54,074
说来听听
Talk to me.

586
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:55,098
据负责她案子的探员所讲
According to the responsible agent,

587
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:57,064
瓦德米尔·勒塔纳对她极度着迷
Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her.

588
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,074
以至于举止粗暴
It turned violent.

589
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,074
有多粗暴
How violent?

590
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:01,098
肋骨骨折  颧骨骨裂
Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.

591
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,094
被送去过几次急诊室
A couple of trips to the emergency room.

592
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:05,024
他有强奸她吗
Did he rape her?

593
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:07,058
档案上没说
Not according to these files,

594
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,074
但看起来他至少曾几次试图强奸她
but it looks like he tried a couple of times.

595
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:12,058
她有告诉你或者黑斯廷斯这些没
Did she say anything about this to you or Hastings?

596
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,041
没有
No.

597
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,004
怎么了  杰克
What's this about, Jack?

598
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:19,008
杰克
Jack?

599
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:22,008
联调局竭尽所能地掩盖了这些事
The FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could.

600
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:23,074
但自从她离开了联调局以后
But after she left the bureau,

601
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,078
蕾妮日渐消沉
Renee went into a tailspin.

602
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:28,064
就我所知  她至少试图自杀过一次

604
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,078
从她眼神里能看出来
I can see it in her eyes.

605
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,081
你觉得她是故意以身犯险来自虐吗
You think she's purposely putting herself in harm's way?

606
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:36,048
我觉得她早已不在乎自己的安危了
I don't think she cares what happens to her either way.

607
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,048
-她现在在哪  -她正要进去

用枪指着我  脸色怎么好得起来

不  我说的不是这个
No, that's not it.

645
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,069

你的嘴还是那么甜

00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,073
那现在我们能谈谈这笔买卖了吗

677
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,036
我也希望是这么简单

这次买卖是你千载难逢的机会
This is the chance of a lifetime.

684
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,043
也把他绑起来
Him, too.

00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:28,063
瓦德  等等
Vlad, wait.

686
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,009
把他们关进后备箱里
Put them in the trunk.

00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:36,006
瓦德米尔  不要这样
Vladimir, Vladimir, no!

是她到我这来的

那个臭婊子
the bitch!

693

我发誓
I swear!

694
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,069
瓦德米尔  我一点都不知情
Vladimir, I don't know anything about this!

695
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:46,026
不
No!

696
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:51,023
克罗伊  到底怎么了
Chloe, what the hell just happened?

697
00:34:51,026 --> 00:34:54,033
他们把她关进了后备箱  我听不到了
They put her in the trunk, I lost audio.

698
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,083
正在增强信号

699
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:56,083

再试试
Try it again.

701

蕾妮  你听得到吗
Renee, can you hear me?

702
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,083
说话
Say something.

703
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:01,089
克罗伊  还是听不到她
Chloe, I don't have her.

704
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:02,096
那估计是装甲车
Then the car must be armored.

705
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,093
要么就是她的通讯器短路了
Either that or her comm shorted out.

706
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:10,009
你看到了吗
Are you seeing this?

707
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,039
看到了

00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,096
我正向北追踪  穿过一条小巷到伍德沃德街

杰克  你准备中途拦截吗

711
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,079

我告诉黑斯廷斯紧急调派一支小队

714
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,066
告诉他  车里有四个人
Tell him I see four men in the car,

715
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,016
而且要假定  他们是要把蕾妮带到某处灭口
and we're going to have to assume they're taking Renee somewhere to kill her.

716
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,064
-明白  -该死的
- Copy that. - Damn it.

717
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:55,017

我现在不给病人看病

00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,049
-我给你叫救护车  -不行

726
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:12,032
不能让别人知道

727
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,096
我的人都在新罗谢尔你家外面守着
My men are outside your house in New Rochelle.

728
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,032

734
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,089
因为你不会和任何人说这件事
because you're not going to try to warn anybody about this.

735
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,056
你明白吗
Do you understand?

736
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,096
我明白

我不知道我能做什么
I'm not sure what it is I can do for him.

741
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,078
为了你的家人好  你最好赶快医治他
Well, you'd better be able to do something, for your family's sake.

742
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,044
我  我得知道他接触的是何种核物质

战术小队三分钟后赶到

他们都知道蕾妮在后备箱吗

给他们的指令是只听我的号令再出击
The instructions are to engage only on my command.

750

有迹象表明他们要把她带到哪去吗

751
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:27,082
-没有  -等他们到达之后再出击可以吗
- None. - Any percentage in letting this play out?

752
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,069
不行  她一从车里出来
No. As soon as she's out of the vehicle,

753
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,032
就会很容易受攻击
she becomes that much more vulnerable.

754
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:33,039

00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,029
瓦德米尔没上钩
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

757
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:38,082
目标转向南  朝弗拉兴街去了
Target just turned south on Flushing.

758
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:41,006
杰克  那是一条前方2.6英里处
Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE

759
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,049
上布鲁克林-皇后区高速公路的岔路
in 2.6 miles.

760
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,056
黑斯廷斯  如果我们不在高速公路下出击
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage on these surface streets,

761
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,019
我们就失去战术优势了
we lose our tactical advantage.

762
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,086
克罗伊  告诉我截击预计时间
Chloe, get me an ETA.

763
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:50,082
还有2分10秒
Intercept in... two minutes, ten seconds.

764
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:53,012
长官  你该打电话了
Sir, you need to make the call now.

765
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,079
好的  我批准截击行动
All right, I'm authorizing engagement.

766
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:57,076
准备接收截击计划
Stand by for intercept protocols.

767

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,049
打开
Open it.

769
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:25,019
瓦德米尔  把她们从后备箱拖出来
Vladimir. Take them out of the trunk.

770
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:27,006
卢戈  求求你  告诉瓦德米尔
Lugo, please, you tell him, tell Vladimir...

771
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,089
克罗伊  又有信号了
Chloe, I've got a signal again.

772
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:30,059
求求你  瓦德米尔
Please, Vladimir, Vlad...

773
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:32,032
出问题了  听起来他们停车了
Something's wrong-- they definitely sound stopped,

774
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:35,026
但我跟踪的车辆还在弗拉兴街向南行驶
but the vehicle I'm following is still going south on Flushing.

775
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:37,049
-是她叫我来找你的  -闭嘴  兹亚
- She told me to come to you! - Shut up, shut up, Ziya.

776
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,079
这一点用都没有
It's not going to do any good.

777
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,029
你说得对  杰克  目标还在移动
Confirming that, Jack, the target is still moving.

778
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:43,012
克罗伊  我们跟踪的是个诱饵
Chloe, we're following a decoy.

779
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,019
他们肯定是坐另一辆车离开的  给我找出来
They must have left in another vehicle. Find it!

780
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,052
好  我把卫星画面调出来
Okay, pulling up a satellite footage.

781
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:50,027
好了  战术小队 原地等待
All right, TAC teams,hold your positions, stand by.

782
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:53,002
杰克  第一辆驶出汽车零件大楼五分钟后  
Jack,another car drove out of the back of the auto parts building

783
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:54,042
大楼后面又开出了另一辆车
five minutes after the first one.

784
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,056
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?!

785
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:58,002
很抱歉  我们注意力全集中到你跟进的目标了
I'm sorry, we were focusing everything on your follow.

786
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,039
告诉我他们在哪
Just tell me where they are!

787
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,086
把他们带到水边去
Take them down to the water.

788
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:21,073
好了  我用GPS找到了蕾妮

789
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:23,066
他们在新镇河停下了
They're pulled off at Newtown Creek,

790
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,082
就在布莱恩纪念大桥南侧
just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge.

791
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:27,077
-战术小队在哪  -我正让他们改道
- Where are the TAC teams? - I'm redirecting them now.

792
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:28,066
他们还有多远
How far out are they?

793
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,049
-至少要十分钟  -让他们赶快

794
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,026
恢复我和蕾妮的通讯  该死的
Put me back on to Renee's comm. Damn it!

795

蕾妮  我是杰克
Renee, it's Jack.

796
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:38,022
我知道你听得见
I know you can hear me.

797
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:39,039
瓦德米尔引诱我们跟错了目标
Vladimir had us following a decoy.

798
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,029
战术小队还有十分钟能到

I'm on my way now.

00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,072
尽量争取时间
Do whatever you have to to buy time.

801
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:49,002
你们两个  都跪下
On your knees, both of you.

802
00:39:49,006 --> 00:39:51,056
请听我说  我什么都不知道
Please listen to me, I don't know anything.

803
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,099
闭上嘴
Shut your mouth.

00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:08,052
你说得对
You were right.

827

真相就是...
The truth is...

00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:22,066
即使你现在放我走

我也没处可去  没人投靠

因为这是我仅有的东西

蕾妮  别这样

837
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,021
再说  凡是你要对我做的事
Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything

838
