《反恐24小时》前情提要
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,078
在乔纳斯·霍奇斯被杀前
Before his death,

3
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,022
他说
Jonas Hodges told us

4
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:19,055
还有其他势力也参与了
That there were other parties involved with him

5
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,039
生化武器的研制
In the creation of this bioweapon.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,078
联邦调查局已经拘押了托尼·阿尔梅达
The FBI has apprehended Tony almeida.

7
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:26,091
他是这次阴谋的关键人物

8
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:30,053
乔纳斯·霍奇斯是在调查局总部外被杀的
Jonas Hodges was killed outside FBI headquarters.

9
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,040
可能跟泰勒小姐有关
Ms. Taylor Might be involved.

10
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,077
奥利维亚的确有很多手段
Olivia is capable of many things,

11
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,086
但我不相信她会去杀人
But I can't believe committing murder is one of them.

12
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:39,029
我需要你打开数字录音系统
I need you to access the digital recording system.

13
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,079
看是否有他们的对话录音
To see if their conversation was recorded.

14
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:46,040
我无法忍受的是那个恶棍逍遥法外
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this.

15
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,066
我手下的人跟你女儿在一起
My operatives are with your daughter.

16
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,075
实际上  我现在就看着她呢
In fact, I'm looking at her right now.

17
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,073
你得帮助托尼·阿尔梅达脱身
You will help Tony Almeida escape

18
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,049
不然我的人会杀了你女儿
Or my people will murder your daughter.

19
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,002
不许动
Don't move.

20
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,043
杰克  为什么这样做
Jack, why?

21
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,097
托尼的同伙
The people that are working with Tony

22
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,032
派了人监视金
Have operatives with Kim right now.

23
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,020
如果我不把他弄出去  他们说会杀了她
They threatened to kill her if I don't break him out.

24
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:07,021
那些监视你的人
People who are watching you,

25
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,001
是找到你父亲的唯一线索
They're our only lead to finding your father

26
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:16,016
那个笔记本上有用来监视我的摄像头
That laptop has the camera they were using to track me.

27
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:18,048
也许可以反向追踪到抓我父亲的人
We may be able to back trace to the people that have my father.

28
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,043
你的人可以按原计划
Your people are gonna be able to launch the biological attacks

29
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:22,074
发动生化袭击
Just as they originally planned.

30
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,081
我们还有杰克
We have Jack.

31
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,051
病原体就在他的身体里
The pathogen's in his organs.

32
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,083
我们可以从他身体里提取我们想要的东西
We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body.

33
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,074
托尼相信我们做的事
Tony believes in what we're doing.

34
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:33,089
你是说我得跟他见面吗
Are you suggesting I meet with him?

35
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,095
我会好好看看阿尔梅达
I'll look Almeida in the eye,

36
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,028
如果有任何地方让我不高兴
And if, for any reason, I don't like what I see,

37
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:41,037
他就别想活着离开
I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive.

38
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,031
他还有多少时间
How much longer does he have?

39
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:44,095
几个小时左右
A couple of hours, give or take.

40
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,071
人死亡后病原体能存活两小时
The pathogen could survive up to two hours after death,

41
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,017
实际上  杀死病原体的唯一方法
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it

42
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:52,060
是将其暴露在在500摄氏温度的高温里
Is by exposure to extreme temperatures above 500-degrees celsius.

43
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,052
让他起来走了
Get him ready to move.

44
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:06,073
以下情节发生在凌晨7点至8点间
The following takes place between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.

45
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:21,017
如果需要找些人来帮你  就告诉我
Tell me if you need more people on this and I will get them for you.

46
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,083
我们不需要人  我们需要的是运气
We don't need people. we need to get lucky.

47
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,082
笔记本里的发送器节点是多个中继加密的
The transmitter node on the laptop is encrypted with multiple relays.

48
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,089
能不能找到发送的接收源
Can you source the transmission or not?

49
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,068
我正想办法
I'm trying to come up with a work-around.

50
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,007
想到马上告诉我
Call me as soon as you have something.

51
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:33,003
还是找不到接收源吗
They still can't source the transmission?

52
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,050
他们正努力
They're working on it.

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,027
克罗伊和詹尼斯正竭尽所能
Chloe and Janis are doing everything that they can.

54
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,060
没有其他的线索或者方法找到我爸爸了吗
Is there no other lead, no other way to find my father?

55
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,011
金  这已经是很有用的线索了
This is a good lead, kim.

56
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,029
我们找到这线索多亏了你
The only reason we have it is 'cause of you.

57
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,008
但我爸爸却快死了
Yeah, except my father's dying.

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,048
我们不知道他还剩多少时间
And we don't know how much time he has left.

59
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,043
请进
Come in.

60
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,059
你还在这里干什么
What are you still doing here?

61
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:47,045
继续我们未完的对话
Just finishing up the conversation we started.

62
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,049
亚伦
Aaron,

63
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,009
我已经叫你把伊桑送出去了
I told you to escort ethan to the gate.

64
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,071
现在把他带出我的办公室  带出白宫
Now take him out of my office and off the white house grounds.

65
00:04:56,071 --> 00:05:00,044
女士  我不能那样做
No, ma'am, I am not gonna do that.

66
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,024
我叫保安来了
I'm calling security.

67
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:10,038
要我挖出诺亚·丹尼尔斯的丑闻是一回事
Having me dig up dirt on Noah Daniels is one thing.

68
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,043
但这次就完全不同了
This is a whole different animal.

69
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,089
这个我明白  马丁
I'm aware of that, Martin.

70
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:17,033
替我办成此事  我要你好好收拾这恶贼
I want this to happen. I want this person taken care of.

71
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,013
是乔纳斯·霍格斯
It's Jonas Hodges.

72
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:28,022
你从我那里搜走的数字存储片是空白的
The digital card you confiscated from me was blank.

73
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,004
我把真的给皮尔斯探员了
I gave the real one to agent Pierce.

74
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,075
亚伦  你知道这事多久了
How long have you known, Aaron?

75
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:43,079
女士  我有怀疑  但我本希望我错了
I had my suspicions, ma'am, but I was hoping I was wrong.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,057
我出去等  先生
I'll wait outside, sir.

77
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,017
伊桑  这并不是事实的全部
Ethan, this doesn't tell the whole story.

78
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,029
对我来说已经够清楚了
Sounds pretty clear to me.

79
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:03,051
霍奇斯死了  是因为你
Hodges is dead, you're responsible.

80
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,045
我知道  可我本想阻止这事发生的
I know, but I tried to stop it from happening.

81
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,026
省省吧  奥利维亚
Oh, save it, Olivia!

82
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,059
你这次可不能耍耍嘴皮子就想没事
You can't talk your way out of this situation, not this time.

83
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,007
好吧  伊桑
All right, Ethan...

84
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,029
你赢了
You win.

85
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,058
我会辞职
I'll resign.

86
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:25,009
编个借口
Come up with some excuse.

87
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,082
你可以复职了
You could have your job again.

88
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:27,075
什么事都
Everything will go...

89
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,076
我不是回来抢工作的
This isn't about getting my job back!

90
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,051
是为了真相
It's about the truth!

91
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,044
真相会危及到我妈妈的政权
The truth could destroy my mother's administration.

92
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:38,008
这事公开的结果
I am fully aware of the implications

93
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,080
我比谁都清楚
If this goes public.

94
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:42,010
不用你来告诉我
You don't have to spell them out for me.

95
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,070
那你想干嘛
Then what do you want?

96
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,017
留给总统去决定
For the president to take the next step.

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,090
继续追究还是保持缄默
Whether she decides to prosecute this or bury it,

98
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,065
这是她的决定
That's her call.

99
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,026
她应该知道真相
But she needs to know the truth.

100
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,081
你自己去跟她讲吧
I'll let you tell her yourself.

101
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,088
真不敢相信你会这样做
I can't believe you're doing this.

102
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,026
你背叛了你所有的信仰
You're betraying everything that you've ever worked for.

103
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,091
我知道这个国家让你失望了
I know you think this country failed you,

104
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:21,059
我也不在乎你现在的信仰变成了什么样
And I don't care what kind of ideology you believe in now.

105
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,029
这绝不值得你去做
This is no way to fight for it.

106
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,032
你在做的一切都是错的
What you're doing is wrong.

107
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,080
这么做是错的  你知道的
This is wrong, and you know it!

108
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,031
托尼  看着我
Damn it, Tony, look at me!

109
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,053
我求你
Please...

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,013
看在我们曾经私交甚笃的面子上
As someone who was once your friend...

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,021
让我平静的死去吧
Let me die in peace.

112
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:46,021
不要让他们用我杀无辜的人了
Don't let them use me to kill innocent people.

113
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,060
我根本没想让他们
I have no intention of letting them use you

114
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,082
在你身体里提取病原体  杰克
As a pathogen, Jack.

115
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:53,073
我没真么想过
I never did.

116
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,052
我听见你说的了
I overheard you. this was your idea.

117
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:57,070
你卖给他们的
You sold it to them.

118
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,017
只是做戏而已
It was just a play.

119
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:02,044
做戏
A play?

120
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,091
是引诱那个幕后主使过来
To get the man who's coming here right now.

121
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:08,003
花了我三年找到他
Took me three years to find him.

122
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,022
又用了一年
Took me another year

123
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,097
能和他面对面
To get him to meet me face-to-face.

124
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,029
我杀了乔纳斯·霍奇斯
I had to prove myself to him

125
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,088
向他证明我的能力
By taking down Jonas Hodges.

126
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:21,011
我用这个向他阐明我对他的信仰深信不疑
I had to convince him that I was a true believer in his cause.

127
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,046
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

128
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:28,013
他叫阿兰·威尔森
His name is Alan Wilson.

129
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,034
是查尔斯·罗根的的幕后主使
He was the man behind Charles Logan.

130
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,056
就是他下令杀了大卫·普拉莫
He's the one who ordered the hit on david palmer,

131
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,007
他杀了蜜雪儿掩盖这一切
And he had michelle killed to cover his tracks.

132
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,087
这个男人杀了我的爱妻
This is the man who murdered my wife, Jack.

133
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,053
你今天做的这一切都是为了复私仇
Everything that you've done today is for personal revenge?

134
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,071
是为了正义
It's about justice.

135
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:49,012
正义  你杀了无辜的人  托尼
Justice. you killed innocent people, Tony!

136
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,008
要不是我这么做
Ten times as many people would have died if it hadn't

137
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,073
十倍于今天的人会死
Been for me. the deeper I dug

138
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,045
我对蜜雪儿的死调查的越深
To find the person responsible for michelle's death,

139
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,097
遇到很多像乔纳斯·霍奇斯一样的人
The more I kept running into men like Jonas Hodges.

140
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:02,088
那些疯狂的想法是他们的  不是我的
They're the ones with the crazy ideology, Jack, not me.

141
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,068
我是要把他们一个个击垮
I'm the one who had a plan to bring them down.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,002
我让比尔和克洛伊
I'd enlisted bill and chloe to help me

143
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:08,058
帮我把组织的每个环节都挖出来
Track all the elements of this group.

144
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,082
当我找到真相的时候
And when I finally got what I wanted,

145
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,089
就会把这一切揭开   击垮他们
They would turn 'em in and shut 'em down.

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,019
你毁了这一切
But you screwed

147
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,031
对不对  杰克
That all up, didn't you, Jack?

148
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:24,034
我是拯救生命的英雄  不是你
You see, I'm the one who saved lives today, Jack, not you.

149
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,057
是我拿回了CIP模块
I'm the one who helped you recover the cip device,

150
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,083
是我警告你关白宫的袭击
I'm the one who warned you about the white house attacks,

151
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,084
是我阻止了乔纳斯·霍奇斯
I'm the one who stopped Jonas Hodges

152
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,001
发射飞弹
From launching those missiles!

153
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,079
你愿意怎么自我安慰就自便吧
You tell yourself whatever you want.

154
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:36,097
你在华盛顿中央地铁站
You launched a biological attack

155
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,019
发动生化袭击
On washington center station,

156
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,060
要不是我们及时赶到
And if we hadn't gotten there in time,

157
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,003
上千无辜平民就死在你手里了
Thousands of innocent people would have been killed!

158
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,054
我只是做了我必须做的引来威尔森
I did what I had to do to get Alan Wilson there.

159
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,090
现在我要杀了他
And now he's gonna die.

160
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,039
你杀了他  就没人知道
You kill him, and no one will ever know the full extent

161
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,048
整个阴谋了
Of this conspiracy.

162
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,060
我不会杀他的  杰克
I'm not gonna kill him, jack...

163
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,069
是你
You are.

164
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,096
托尼  妈的
Damn you, tony. damn you.

165
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,047
对不起这样对你
I'm sorry that it has to be you,

166
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,006
因为他们不会让我在他
But the truth is, they wouldn't let me

167
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,055
50尺之内的
Within 50 feet of the guy.

168
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,069
他是来要你的
You're the one he's coming for.

169
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,061
你不是在缅怀蜜雪儿
You're not honoring michelle's life.

170
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,016
你利用了她的死
You are reveling in her death, and she would

171
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,042
而她会因此看不起你
Despise you for this.

172
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:48,005
装置已装备完毕
Device armed.

173
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:03,005
安全了
We're clear.

174
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,092
威尔森什么时候到
When's wilson coming?

175
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,099
快到了
Soon.

176
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,095
他想看鲍尔的病历
He wants to see bauer's medical record.

177
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:43,065
威尔森不认识我们
Wilson doesn't know about us.

178
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,065
最好保持原样  至少现在保持这样
And it's best to keep it that way, at least for now.

179
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,039
好
Sure.

180
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,039
我明白
I understand.

181
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:58,039
他来了
He's here.

182
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,079
准备好了吗
Ready?

183
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,085
好了
Yeah.

184
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:09,079
走
Let's go.

185
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,025
双手放在脑后
Put your hands behind your head.

186
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,082
全部安全  先生
We're all clear, sir.

187
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,045
别向前走了
That's far enough for you.

188
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,072
你好
Hello,

189
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,072
我是卡拉
Cara.

190
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,092
这位是托尼·阿尔梅达
This is Tony Almeida.

191
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:13,029
我期盼这天已经很久了  先生
I've been looking forward to this, sir.

192
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,082
我知道
Yes, I know.

193
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,025
鲍尔在哪里
Where's Bauer?

194
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,029
就在里面
Right inside.

195
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,055
第二个门进去右转
Second door on the right.

196
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,055
带上这个
Need this.

197
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:34,012
卡拉认为该提拔你
So Cara thinks you should be playing a larger role

198
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,025
在我们组织当个领导
In our organization.

199
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,065
你功不可没
You've been an asset.

200
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:39,009
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

201
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,002
但我还能为组织贡献更多
But I believe there's a lot more I can bring to the table.

202
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,025
可事先
But first,

203
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,065
我得先看看鲍尔的病理学报告
I want to see Bauer's pathology report.

204
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,005
我带来了
I have it right here.

205
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,079
我们是联邦调查局
This is the FBI!

206
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,075
你们被包围了
You're surrounded!

207
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:04,099
放下武器
Lay down your weapons!

208
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,049
快  自由开火
Come on. Fire at will!

209
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,079
我重复一遍  放下武器
I repeat, lay down your weapons!

210
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,095
托尼
Tony!

211
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,025
放我们下去
Set us down.

212
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,052
带我去那辆绿色货车  快
I need you to get me to that green van! Go!

213
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,092
杰克
Jack.

214
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,019
离我远点  我被绑上了C4炸药
Stay away from me; i'm wired with C4.

215
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,089
引爆器在托尼手里
Tony's got the detonator.

216
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,092
走开
Stay away!

217
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:39,055
等等  我懂这种触发原理
Wait, I know this trigger mechanism.

218
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:41,052
我可以拆卸炸药
I can disarm it.

219
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,099
金在哪里
Where's Kim?

220
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,025
她很安全
She's safe.

221
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,042
我们靠她才找到了你
She's the reason we were able to find you.

222
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,085
托尼一直在上演无间道
Tony's been playing both sides all along.

223
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,042
你赶快去制止他
You need to stop him.

224
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,015
他想去杀幕后黑手
He's trying to kill the man who's behind this conspiracy.

225
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:53,055
这人名叫艾伦·威尔森
His name is Alan Wilson.

226
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,072
是他杀死了托尼的妻子米歇尔
He was responsible for killing Tony's wife Michelle.

227
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:58,019
所以他精心策划了这次行动
That's why he's doing this.

228
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,092
如果你想永远组织这场灾难
You want to end this for good,

229
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:02,025
就得马上阻止托尼杀害他
You need to stop Tony from killing him.

230
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:05,042
否则就会失去机会  将其他成员一网打尽
Otherwise, you're gonna lose any chance of exposing the others.

231
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,052
好了  安全了
Okay, you're clear.

232
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:13,009
快走
Let's go.

233
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:20,072
这里是伍德塞的工业中心
Woodside industrial complex.

234
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,025
我们正在通往警戒线的东南区域
We're at the southeast quadrant on our way to the perimeter.

235
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,025
找到突围口后联系我
Call me when you have an exfiltration point.

236
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:28,002
怎么会这样
How did this happen?

237
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,019
他们怎么会追踪到我们
How did they track us?

238
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:31,005
不清楚
I don't know.

239
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,009
托尼
Tony!

240
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,025
谢天谢地你安然无恙
Thank god you're okay.

241
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,069
突围小队快到了
The extraction team will be here soon,

242
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,075
可我们得继续赶路
But we got to move.

243
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:09,032
我花了好长时间才找到你
It took me a long time to find you.

244
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:14,042
我抽丝剥茧  才发现你是幕后主使
To peel back all the layers of people you hide behind.

245
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,092
可我依然静观其变
But I stayed patient.

246
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:24,009
因为你派人杀害她那天起
Because ever since the day you had her killed,

247
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:27,005
唯一让我活下去的动力
The only thing that kept me alive

248
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,049
就是等待此时此刻的到来
Was this moment right here.

249
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,059
你的语气好像在说你是某种悲剧的受害者
Mm, you sound like you were involved in

250
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,089
但和我毫不相干
Some kind of a tragedy, but I had nothing to do with it.

251
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,045
你看  我和米歇尔
See, Michelle and me

252
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,012
患难与共
Had gotten out of all this.

253
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,032
我们最终走到了一起
We made it out together.

254
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:54,032
并准备开始过崭新的生活
And we were gonna start a whole new life.

255
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,059
直到你出现
Until you came along

256
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,052
就在那一瞬间
And took it all away

257
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:01,085
夺走了一切幸福美好
In a split second.

258
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,069
你不只谋杀了我老婆
It wasn't just my wife you murdered.

259
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:19,042
她正怀着我儿子
She was carrying my son.

260
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:27,029
你杀了我儿子
You killed my son!

261
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,032
我儿子
My son!

262
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:30,059
现在
And now

263
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,059
我要杀了你丫的
I'm gonna kill you.

264
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:42,032
托尼  不许动
Tony, don't move.

265
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,032
托尼  不许动
Tony, don't move!

266
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,042
带他出去
Get him out of here.

267
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,029
不
no!

268
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,089
杰克  这些人以为他们能夺走我们的一切
These people think they can take everything away from us, Jack!

269
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,055
必须有人阻止他们
Somebody had to stop them!

270
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,072
看你做了什么
And what'd you do, huh?!

271
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:17,065
你逃开了
You ran away!

272
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,055
没错  杰克  你逃开了
That's right, you ran away, Jack!

273
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,075
你现在跟他们是一路货色了
You're one of them now!

274
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,022
恭喜你
Congratulations!

275
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,015
泰莉会怎么想呢
How would Teri feel about that,

276
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,005
啊  杰克  啊
huh, Jack?! huh?!

277
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,045
你没种了啊
You lost your nerve!

278
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,009
杰克  你是个懦夫
You're a coward, Jack!

279
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,032
因为你  今天死了很多人
A lot od people died today because of you.

280
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:20,029
包括我身边的人
Including someone close to me.

281
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,009
你将面临叛国罪以及
You will be charged with treason and conspiracy to launch

282
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,060
阴谋发动恐怖袭击罪的起诉
Terrorist attacks against this country.

283
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,024
唯有跟我们合作
The only way that I see you

284
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,079
你才能够避免被判死刑
Avoiding the death penalty is by cooperating.

285
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:37,019
告诉我们还有谁参与了这个阴谋
Tell me who else is involved in this conspiracy,

286
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,002
我敢保证陪审团会
And I will make sure that your cooperation

287
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:41,079
考虑到你的合作态度从轻发落
Is taken into account by the grand jury.

288
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:47,062
我都不明白你说的是什么  谈何合作呢
How can I cooperate if I have no idea what you're talking about?

289
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,025
威尔森  不要垂死挣扎了
It's not gonna work, Wilson.

290
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,045
无论你认为我
Whatever this conspiracy is

291
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,089
参与了何种阴谋  我向你保证
That you think that I'm a part of, I guarantee

292
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:03,019
你不会找到任何有关我的物证
You won't find a shred of material evidence connecting me to it.

293
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:06,089
法律上说  我是无辜的
In the eyes of the law, I'm an innocent man.

294
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,012
你个畜生
You son of a bitch!

295
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,015
还有什么要说的话
Anything else you need to say,

296
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:13,019
可以跟我的律师说
You can say to my attorneys.

297
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,039
女士
Ma'am.

298

他们准备好送鲍尔去医院了
They're almost ready to take Bauer to the hospital.

299
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,092
你让我们通知你的
You wanted a heads up.

300
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:30,085
我将给你注射二氢吗啡酮
I'm giving you hydromorphone

301

-可以止痛  -不  暂时不用

求你了
Please.

305
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,000
杰克
Jack.

306
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:47,024
让我们单独待会儿
Could you give us a moment?

307
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,004
麦斯医生要求你去医院
Dr. Macer wants you at the hospital.

308
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:52,000
没关系  让她等会儿
It's all right, she can wait.

309
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,050
谢谢
Thank you.

310
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,070
发生什么事
What happened?

311
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,070
他推得一干二净
He's denying everything.

312
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,087
他说我们无证据指控他
Claims that we don't have a case against him.

313
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:07,050
是这样吗
Is he right?

314
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,023
也许吧
Maybe.

315
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,050
也就是说他没有理由说出
Which means he has absolutely no reason

316
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,073
他同党的名字
To tell us who else is involved in this with him.

317
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,087
但我可以让他开口
But I can make him talk.

318
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:19,027
如果不找到这些人
If we don't find these people,

319
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:20,083
总有一天他们还会发动袭击
One day they will launch another attack,

320
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,003
我不知道自己怎么能忍受
And I don't see how I can live with myself

321
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,067
明知自己可以阻止袭击的发生
Knowing that there was something I could have done to stop it.

322
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:33,053
我不知道该做什么
I don't know what to do.

323
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,090
我不能告诉你该怎么做
I can't tell you what to do.

324
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,007
这一生我都在纠缠于这种事
I've been wrestling with this one my whole life.

325
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:45,023
如果我眼看着汽车上有15名人质
I-I see 15 people held hostage on a bus,

326
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,063
其他的一切我都不管了
And everything else goes out the window.

327
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:50,057
为了救他们我愿意做任何事  我是说
And I will do whatever it takes to save them, and I mean

328
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,057
不择手段
Whatever it takes.

329
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:00,003
我想大概是我以为
I guess maybe I thought...

330
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:03,007
如果救了他们
If I save them...

331
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,040
我也救了自己
I'd save myself.

332
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,030
今天做的事情你后悔吗
Do you regret anything that you did today?

333
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:16,067
不
No.

334
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,007
还是那句话  我是不是调查局的人
Then again, I don't work for the FBI.

335
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,000
我不明白
I don't understand.

336
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,090
你宣誓过
You took an oath.

337
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,023
你承诺要效忠法律
You made a promise to uphold the law.

338
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,070
当你越过那条底线的时候
When you cross that line,

339
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,067
一步错步步错
It always starts off with a small step.

340
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:37,033
在你觉察到之前  你一个劲地跑
Before you know it, you're running as fast as you can

341
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,053
却是南辕北辙
In the wrong direction.

342
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:42,020
只是为了证明你的初衷
Just to justify what you started in the first place.

343
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,077
这些法律是一些
These laws were written

344
00:24:43,077 --> 00:24:45,077
比你我都聪明多的人编写的
By much smarter men than me.

345
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:48,027
最后我知道这些法条
And in the end, I know that these laws

346
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:51,050
一定得比公交上的15条人命重要
Have to be more important than the 15 people on the bus.

347
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,090
在我心底
I know that's right.

348
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,010
我知道那是对的
In my mind,

349
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,093
我知道那是对的
I know that's right.

350
00:24:57,093 --> 00:25:02,063
我只是认为我的心无法承受这些
I just don't think my heart could ever have lived with it.

351
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:09,097
我想我能给你的唯一建议就是
I guess the only advice I can give you is...

352
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,013
去做那些你能承受的选择
Try to make choices that you can live with.

353
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:27,023
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

354
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:40,037
那就什么都别说
Don't say anything at all.

355
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:52,007
鲍尔先生  我们该走了
Mr. Bauer, we really need to go.

356
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:25,087
亨利
Henry!

357
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:29,030
你下床来干什么
What are you doing out of bed?

358
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:36,017
发生了什么事
What's going on?

359
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,083
奥利维亚说你来了才肯说
Olivia wouldn't say until you got here.

360
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,057
当我说出口时你们会明白
You'll understand when I tell you.

361
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:52,057
开口一次都足够艰难
It's gonna be hard enough to say once.

362
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:55,037
说吧  利维
I'm listening, Livy.

363
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:57,037
这是怎么了
What's this about?

364
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,077
乔纳斯·霍奇斯
Jonas Hodges.

365
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,040
他是因为我才死的
He's dead because of me.

366
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,070
利维
Oh, Livy,

367
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,073
别告诉我
Don't tell me you were the one

368
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,073
是你把消息泄露出去的
Who leaked the information.

369
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:17,020
比那更糟
It's worse than that.

370
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,073
奥利维亚
Olivia...

371
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:21,093
跟我们说
Talk to us.

372
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:28,087
他谋杀了罗杰
He killed Roger.

373
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,093
霍奇斯谋杀了我弟弟
Hodges killed my brother.

374
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:39,040
但你却同意让他加入证人保护计划
And then you agreed to put him into witness protection.

375
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,070
一想到他会逃脱惩罚
And the thought of him getting away

376
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,030
我就忍受不了
Was too much for me.

377
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:51,063
所以我打电话给马丁·柯里尔
So I called Martin Collier.

378
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:54,040
他曾今
He had once...

379
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,053
跟我说过他认识一些人可以做这类事
Told me he knew someone who could do this kind of thing.

380
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:03,027
你是说  柯里尔雇人
You're saying... Collier hired someone

381
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:06,003
谋杀了乔纳斯·霍奇斯
To kill Jonas Hodges?

382
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,053
不
No.

383
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:11,023
是我雇的
I did.

384
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,010
我叫停过
I tried calling it off,

385
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,010
但是一切都太晚了  事情发生得太快
But it was too late, and everything was happening so fast.

386
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,010
奥利维亚
Olivia...

387
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,030
还有谁知道这些
Who else knows about this?

388
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,087
伊桑
Ethan.

389
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,080
他有一份录音
He has a recording

390
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,037
记录了我和马丁的谈话
Of my conversation with Martin.

391
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:34,000
他同意不交给司法部长
He's agreed not to turn it over to the attorney general.

392
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,033
他还说会尊重您的决定  证据任由您处置
He says he'll respect whatever you decide to do with the evidence.

393
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,050
妈  说些话吧
Mom, say something.

394
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,020
你怎么能这么做
How could you do this?!

395
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,050
奥利维亚
Olivia!

396
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,053
你怎么能这么做如此愚蠢之事
How could you do something so stupid?

397
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:51,030
对不起  我发誓  我叫停过
I'm sorry-- I tried to call it off, I swear!

398
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,063
那不重要  亲爱的  事已至此
It doesn't matter, darling, it happened!

399
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:54,093
看在老天的份上
For god's sake,

400
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,087
艾莉森  别再朝她吼叫了
Allison, stop yelling at her.

401
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:59,057
霍奇斯谋杀了我们的儿子
Hodges killed our son.

402
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:01,067
我知道是他干的
I know what he did.

403
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:06,040
所以如果有人该死  一定是他
Then you know if anyone deserves to die, it's him.

404
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,083
你现在该考虑的
All you should be thinking about now

405
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,033
就是如何保护我们的女儿
Is how to protect our daughter.

406
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,097
保护她
Protect her?

407
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,053
怎么保护
How?

408
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,063
销毁证据
Destroy that recording.

409
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:22,007
然后掩饰一桩谋杀案吗
And cover up a murder?

410
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,043
亨利  我不能无视法律啊
Henry, I can't just disregard the law!

411
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:28,027
艾莉森  别假装神圣了
Allison, spare me your sanctimony.

412
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,033
你是奥利维亚的母亲
You're Olivia's mother.

413
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:33,043
我也是美国的总统
I'm also the president of the United States.

414
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:37,030
可我们家已经为此付出了沉重的代价
And our family's already paid a steep enough price for that.

415
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,010
你在说什么啊  亨利
What are you saying, Henry?

416
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,033
你知道我在说什么
You know exactly what I'm saying.

417
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:49,073
你的工作葬送了我们的儿子
Your job cost our son his life.

418
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:55,043
这么说太残忍了
That is a cruel thing to say.

419
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:59,007
我无法阻止罗杰遇害
I couldn't have done anything to prevent Roger's death.

420
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,000
但你能做些事来阻止这件事
But you can do something about this.

421
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:06,097
看在老天的份上  艾莉森
For god's sakes, Allison...

422
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:10,013
我们已经失去了一个孩子
We've already lost one child.

423
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,017
对不起打扰  总统阁下
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president,

424
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,007
但是调查局有些消息过来
But there's some news from the bureau

425
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:20,063
您需要听一下
You need to hear.

426
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:23,013
是好消息
Uh, good news.

427
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,027
我一会过去  蒂姆
I'll be down in a moment, Tim.

428
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,073
是的  阁下
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:41,040
去吧  艾莉森
Go, Allison.

430
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,077
可你要答应我
But so help me...

431
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,097
毁掉那段录音
Destroy that recording...

432
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:52,003
来保护这个家里仅剩的成员
And save what's left of this family.

433
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:57,067
去吧
Go.

434
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,097
爸  我都做了些什么
Dad, what did I do?

435
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,013
我们会妥善处理
We're going to figure this out.

436
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,000
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

437
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,007
我们会妥善处理
We'll figure it out.

438
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:41,057
他是个重要嫌犯
He's a high-value suspect--

439
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:44,020
在我赶去之前  确保封锁所有出口
Make sure you restrict access until I get there.

440
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,073
沃克探员正在带他返回
Agent Walker's bringing him back now.

441
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,067
-他们什么时候到  -10分钟之内
- What's their ETA? - About ten minutes.

442
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,070
我20分钟之内到
I'll be there in 20--

443
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,023
在那之前把威尔森的移交文件处理好
Have Wilson's transfer papers in order by then.

444
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,047
克罗伊  打扰一下
Excuse me, Chloe?

445
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,023
我要去处理威尔森的移交文件
I've got to work on Wilson's transfer papers,

446
00:31:58,023 --> 00:32:00,040
所以我们晚些时候再汇报情况
So we're gonna have to schedule debriefing for later.

447
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,030
我可以晚点再来  明天也行
I can come back later, or tomorrow.

448
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,057
你住在城里吗
You staying in town?

449
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,033
我想在这里帮杰克
I want to be here for Jack.

450
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,070
我要谢谢你  你今天给了我很大帮助
I'd like to thank you for all the help you gave me today.

451
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,093
是的  很有趣
Yeah, it was... interesting.

452
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:15,080
考虑到你得和别人共事
Given what you have to work with,

453
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,020
你做的很不错
You're doing a pretty good job.

454
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,003
我把这句话当做表扬了  谢谢
I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you.

455
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:26,010
很好  其实我就是那个意思
Good. That's what it was meant to be.

456
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,083
因为病原体已经武器化了
Because the pathogen was weaponized,

457
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,047
你的病已经到了晚期
The disease is at an advanced stage.

458
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:08,047
鲍尔先生  我很抱歉
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauer.

459
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,053
我所能做的只有给你注射吗啡
All I can do is administer morphine,

460
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:14,007
那会引起昏迷  但你不会感觉疼痛
Which will induce a coma, but you won't feel any pain.

461
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:17,067
不用吗啡  不用  拜托
No morphine. Not yet, please.

462
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:21,000
打扰一下  梅瑟尔医生  有人来看鲍尔先生
Excuse me, Dr. Macer. Mr. Bauer has a visitor.

463
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,093
没事
Yeah, it's all right.

464
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,013
他现在要见你
He'll see you now.

465
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:40,090
我就在外面
I'll be outside.

466
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,017
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

467
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:55,027
我很意外接到你的电话
I was surprised to get your call.

468
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:59,097
我快死了
I'm dying.

469
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:04,003
我知道
I know.

470
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,090
我犯了太多错误
I made so many mistakes.

471
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,067
而且我总以为  我早晚会有时间
And I always thought that I would have the time

472
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,063
亡羊补牢
To correct them.

473
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,080
你有时间的
You have the time.

474
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,047
现在就可以
Right now.

475
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:29,047
你不知道我做过什么
You don't know what I've done.

476
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,043
我们生活在复杂的世界里  鲍尔先生
We live in complex times, Mr. Bauer.

477
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:39,027
是非黑白没有明确的界限
Nothing is black and white.

478
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,013
可我知道
But I do know this.

479
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:44,030
我看见我面前的这位男子
I see before me a man

480
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,080
他既有缺点
With all his flaws

481
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,097
也有美德
And all his goodness.

482
00:34:51,057 --> 00:34:54,067
只是一个人
Simply a man.

483
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,070
让我们一起宽恕我们自己吧
Let us both forgive ourselves

484
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,023
宽恕我们犯下的所有过错
For all the wrongs that we have done.

485
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,097
谢谢
Thank you.

486
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,098
是时候了
It's time.

487
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,043
奥利维亚  过来坐
Olivia, come and sit down.

488
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,053
不  我不行
No, I can't.

489
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:52,083
我从没有想到  我的工作会
I never imagined that this job would...

490
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,020
会给你们两带来如此沉重的负担
Would be so hard on both of you.

491
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,070
我不知道这个家要付出怎样的代价
I had no idea of the price this family would pay.

492
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,023
对此  我很抱歉
And for that, I am so sorry.

493
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:12,080
但是我宣誓过  我有责任
But I have a sworn duty

494
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,093
严格执法
To enforce the constitution.

495
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:21,016
如果不能履行誓言  那将是最不堪的虚伪
And failing to honor that oath...would be the worst kind of hypocrisy.

496
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:27,043
奥利维亚  我爱你胜过世间万物
Olivia, I love you more than anything in this world

497
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:31,061
我会竭尽所能帮你渡过难关
and I will do everything I can to help you through this...

498
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:36,008
但作为总统  我必须大义灭亲
but as president,this is what I have to do...

499
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:40,012
尽管这将会让我心碎欲绝
no matter how much it breaks my heart.

500
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:47,066
皮尔斯探员会把你送交联邦政府羁押
Agent Pierce will remand youto federal custody.

501
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:09,011
女士  我护送您去司法部
Ma'am, I'm escorting you to the Justice Department...

502
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:12,095
在正式的指控提出之前
where you'll be held until formal charges...

503
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,025
您将待在那里
have been issued.

504
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,091
对不起  亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.

505
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,049
亨利
Henry.

506
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:45,048
艾莉森
Allison.

507
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:51,068
-要是你现在不想谈   -不
- if you'd like to talk later...  - No.

508
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:59,087
虽然我很想息事宁人
As much as I wanted to cover this up,

509
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:02,076
我  我不能那么做
I... I couldn't.

510
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:05,096
你不必解释  总统阁下
You don't have to explain yourself to me, madam president.

511
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:08,016
我完全理解
I understand completely.

512
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:09,096
亨利不理解
Henry doesn't.

513
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:13,079
他会想通的
He'll come around.

514
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,059
迟早
in time.

515
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,077
他不会的  伊桑
I don't think he will, Ethan.

516
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:25,060
真的
I really don't.

517
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,023
我失去了我的家庭
I've lost my family.

518
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,007
失去了所有人
I've lost everyone.

519
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,043
不是所有人
Not everyone.

520
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:50,032
那你愿意收回辞职信了吗
Then you'll take back your letter of resignation?

521
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:53,026
如果你希望的话
If you want me to.

522
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,027
我希望
I do.

523
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:59,046
我需要你的帮助  伊桑
I need your help, Ethan,

524
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,046
现在就需要
and I need it now.

525

名字是艾伦·威尔森

527

伍兹已经去提审威尔森了
Woods is on his way to pick up Wilson,

528
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:41,027
你需要签发移交文件
And you need to sign the transfer documents.

529
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,057
怎么了
What's wrong?

530
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:54,020
出什么事了
What's going on?

531
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,009
出去下  詹尼丝
Get out of here, Janis.

532
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,066
-什么  -我说了出去
- Excuse me? - I said get out of here.

533
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:59,032
你要干什么
What are you doing?

534
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:01,012
出去
Get out.

535
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:02,076

很好

你在干什么
What are you...?

539

-你在干什么  -把手放在头上
- What are you doing? - Put your hands over your head.

540
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,076
我让你把手放在头上  詹尼丝
I said do it now, Janis!

541
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,076
把你的手拷在柱子上
Secure your hands to that pole.

542
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,079
-快  -好的好的
- Now! - Okay, okay, okay.

543
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,072
冷静下来  行吗  冷静

544
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,042

Renee, please don't do this.

545
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,012
别这么做
Please don't do this.

546
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:30,012
你做了分内事
You've done your job.

547
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,029
你逮捕了他
You arrested him.

548
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,059
剩下的让检察院来管吧
Let the courts take it from here.

549
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,046
你现在收手 还为时不晚
Stop this now... Before it's too late.

550
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:39,096
别自毁前程
Don't throw away your career.

551
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:42,093
你这么做简直疯了
This is absolutely insane.

552
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,093
拉里肯定不想你这样
Larry would not have wanted this.

553
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,097
不要让他蒙羞
Don't dishonor his death like this.

554
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,020
爸爸
Daddy.

555
00:43:40,007 --> 00:43:42,019
我来晚了
I'm too late.

556
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,032
不  金  他还活着
No, he's still alive, Kim.

557
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,089
我们让他昏迷
We induced a coma to help

558
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,012
缓解愈加严重的症状带给他的痛苦
Ease him through the harsher symptoms.

559
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:51,066
我叫高哈
My name is Gohar.

560
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:54,027
是他的朋友
I'm a friend.

561
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,020
朋友
A friend?

562
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,002
他昏迷前几分钟我和他谈过
We spent the last few minutes talking

563
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,087
我可以告诉你  他已经接受了事实
And I can tell you he's accepted what is happening.

564
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:09,079
他是接受了
Maybe he has.

565
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,072
但我还没有
But I haven't.

566
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,079
你告诉我的那个干细胞疗法
The stem cell treatment that you told me about.

567
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,086
现在还能做吗
Can we still do it?

568
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:17,046
我告诉过你  这种方法还处于实验阶段
As I told you, it's experimental

569
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,046
而且成功率很低
And the odds of success are very low.

570
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:21,067
你只要告诉我还来不来得及
Just tell me if it's too late to try.

571
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,046
来得及
No.

572
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:24,059
那我要求这么做
Then I want to do it.

573
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,059
但是  风险
The risks--

574
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,019
我知道有风险
I understand the risks.

575
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,069
我也知道我的父亲不想我尝试救他
And I know my father didn't want me to take that chance,

576
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,082
但现在是我自己的选择
But it's my choice now

577
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,057
我意已决
And I made up my mind.

578
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,086
我是桑尼·梅瑟尔
This is Sunny Macer.

579
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:45,022
我现在急需一套手术设备
I need immediate access to a surgical suite.

580
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:46,097
让罗森医生马上打给我
Have Dr. Rosen call me right away.

581
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,043
对不起  爸爸
I'm sorry, daddy.

582
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:29,097
但我不想让你离我而去
But I'm not ready to let you go.
