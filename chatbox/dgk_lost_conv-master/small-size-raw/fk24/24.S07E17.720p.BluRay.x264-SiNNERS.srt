00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:18,023
利维  找到能接替伊桑的人恐怕还要几周
Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.

3
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:22,024
在这段时间里  我还需要一个代理参谋长
In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,010

拉里·莫斯想跟您通话
I have Larry Moss calling for you.

6
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,061
总统阁下  我们有证据表明
Ma'am, we have evidence

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,011
朱玛允许斯塔克伍德把桑加拉

8
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:31,054
作为制造生化武器的实验基地

9
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:33,035
你是说这些武器就在美国本土吗
Are you saying these weapons are on us soil?

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,048
我们猜测这些武器就在
We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters

11
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,068
斯塔克伍德的弗吉尼亚总部
In Virginia.

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,058
你该不会是认为斯塔克伍德
And you're not suggesting that Starkwood intends

13
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,055
会使用这些武器来攻击我们的国家吗
To use those weapons to attack this country?

14
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:40,072
照他们今天的行动来看
Given their actions today,

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
我们必须马上对斯塔克伍德采取措施
We need to move on Starkwood immediately.

16
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:44,019
他们快杀将过来了
They're coming.

17
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:46,046
而且会拿着所掌握的证据找上门来
And they'll be coming with everything they've got.

18
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:49,030
唯一能制止他们的办法
And the only thing that's going to stop them

19
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:51,043
就是部署好这些武器
Is getting these weapons ready to deploy.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,003
告诉我联邦调查局掌握了多少我们的情况
Tell me what the FBI knows.

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,024
我什么也不知道
I don't know anything,

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,040
霍奇斯先生
Mr. Hodges.

23
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,031
把他带出去
Get him out of here

24
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,054
该用刑时就用刑
And do what you have to do.

25
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:04,021
我不想因为乔纳斯·霍奇斯的疯狂行为
I'm not spending the rest of my life

26
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,071
而在监狱里过下半辈子
In prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind.

27
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,048
-你知道武器在哪里吗  -是的

28
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,028
杰克在哪
Where's Jack?

29
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:12,022
他试图保护武器不被夺走
He managed to secure the weapons,

30
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,095
但还是被斯塔克伍德抢了回去
But Starkwood got him back.

31
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,059
杰克暴露在毒气中
Jack was exposed.

32
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,084
但你们一定有办法可以救他
There has to be something that you can do to help him.

33
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:19,009
无药可医
There's no cure.

34
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:20,092
我们知道武器的方位了
We got a location on the weapon.

35
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,076
我们正准备派部队进行突袭
We're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound

36
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,075
我要参加
I want to go.

很抱歉  我不会批准
I'm sorry. i can't allow it.

我是唯一见过毒气罐的人

39
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,027
我知道它什么样
I know exactly what we're looking for.

40
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,004
但你被感染了  我们不知道
But you're sick. we have no idea

41
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,051
你什么时候会发作
When you're going to start showing symptoms.

42
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:33,057
你是对的
You're right.

43
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,055
武器到底在哪里
Where are the damn weapons?!

44
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,045
他耍了我
He played me.

45
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:45,095
西顿老弟给我们争取到了一点时间
Little old Seaton bought us some time.

46
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,065
我们要在整个基地中
We're going to do a point by point search of this entire compound.

47
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,012
做地毯式搜查
Of this entire compound.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,013
这里有生化武器

找不到  我们不会走
We're not going anywhere without them.

50
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,007
如果你们再得寸进尺
You try to advance any farther,

51
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,024
我们会开枪还击
You will be fired upon.

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,024
以下情节发生在凌晨12点至1点间
The following takes place between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m.

00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,021
全副武装
Everything mil-spec.

55
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:20,008
对  他们这是守株待兔
Yeah. they were waiting for us.

56
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,005
这是个大陷阱
This was one big trap.

57
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,038
蕾妮  用监控卫星帮帮我们
Renee, we would really use those satellite overheads.

58
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,065
收到  拉里

子网已经崩溃了
The subnet's been crashing.

61
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,009
等一下  等等  好了
Okay, wait, wait, wait. here we go.

62
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,019
我已重新连上5号卫星

拉里  你们被四面包围了

该死  给我找个突破口

67
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,088
正在找  但是没有能突围的路线

你得叫你的人退下  让我们继续搜查
You need to move your men and allow us to proceed.

我要你们离开我们的领地

还得把我的人放了
And i want you to release my man.

00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,061
你们没权力把他扣为人质
You have no right to take him hostage.

83
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,048
我是奉美国总统之令行事

奉命来搜查这栋楼

搜了吗
Have you looked?

87
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,009
有大规模杀伤性武器吗
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

88
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,092
有任何武器吗
Are there weapons of any kind?

89
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:44,016
到底有还是没有
Is there anything in here at all?!

90
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,013
莫斯探员
Agent Moss,

91
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,027
谁这么异想天开
Who dreamed up this charade?

92

报上名来
Give me a name.

93
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,064
我们得追究到底
Let's get to the bottom of this.

94
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,021
你想跟我谈  霍奇斯先生
You want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges?

95
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,035
就让你的人把枪都放下
Get these guns off my head.

96
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,028
被人拿枪指着头就受不了了吗
You think you have a gun at your head?

97
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,075
那我呢
You know what i've got?

98
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:10,055
大半夜的  美国政府兵临城下
I've got the United States government sending SWAT Teams

99
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,076
派来了特警队还有武装直升机
And attack helicopters in the middle of the night.

100
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:17,063
我可是为国效忠了整整30个春秋啊
I've got a government that i served faithfully for 30 years,

101
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,010
换来的却是  那些没种露出真实嘴脸的
Dreaming up bs accusations,

102
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:23,057
政客们编造出一系列莫须有的指控
So politicians too cowardly to show their faces,

103
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,080
葬送了我毕生的基业
Can dismantle my company.

104
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,024
这就是我得到的回报
That's what i've got.

105
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,038
给你5分钟时间
You've got five minutes

106
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:36,038
你和你的手下坐着这些直升机
To get these-these helicopters flying out of here

107
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,055
给我离开这儿
With all of you on board.

108
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,095
你不能这样
You don't want to do this.

109
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:42,065
就5分钟
Five minutes.

110
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,084
放了我的人
And i want my man back.

111
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,073
蕾妮  听见了吗
Renee, you get that?

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,083
我们听见了
Yeah, we did.

113
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,087
-有何良策  -就5分钟吗
- And what options do we have? - In five minutes?

114
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:58,070
我知道没时间调兵遣将作战术支援了
I know there's no time to bring in more tac support,

115
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,000
有别的路可走吗
So give me something else.

116
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,014
好吧  拉里  给我一点时间  等一下
All right, Larry, give me a second. stand by.

117
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,021
就是这个
That's it.

118
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,075
我要给你看点儿东西
I want to show you something.

119
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:11,025
霍奇斯只给我们5分钟撤离基地
Hodges just gave us five minutes to clear the base.

120
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:13,006
形势对我们不利  我们失去了制胜先机
We lost that situation. we were outmaneuvered

121
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,052
但是我想我找到了一个新突破口
But i think i found us a new way in.

122
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:16,042
看  这是迈尔参议员提供的文件
Look. these are senator Mayer's files.

123
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,028
道格拉斯·诺尔斯  斯塔克伍德的主席
This is Douglas Knowles. he's the chairman of Starkwood.

124
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,059
就是他协助参议员进行调查
He was actually helping the senator with the investigation.

125
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,033
是他暗中协助披露了公司内幕
He is the one who brokered the deal to open the company's books.

126
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,093
又一个内应吗  不是刚上过一回当吗
What, another insider? didn't we just get burned?

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,016
听着
Just listen.

128
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,027
诺尔斯为霍奇斯干了快20年了
Knowles was loyal to Hodges for almost 20 years.

129
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,070
现在他却秘密地协助
And now he's secretly helping the

130
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,087
参议员搞垮斯塔克伍德公司
senator take down the Starkwood.

131
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,000
他有顾虑
He's scared of something.

132
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,094
这家伙会帮上我们的
This man wants to help us.

133
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,041
值得一试
It's worth a shot.

好的  给他打电话
Yeah. make the call.

诺尔斯先生  我是杰克·鲍尔
Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

137
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,095
我从迈尔参议员那得到了你的号码
I got your number from senator Mayer.

138
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,046
迈尔参议员已经死了

名字叫约翰·奎恩
A man named John Quinn.

00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:03,057
你不知道我有多希望有人来找我
You have no idea how much i was hoping someone would call.

143
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,070
抱歉  先生  我不明白
I'm sorry, sir. i don't understand.

144
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:07,087
事态越发地失控了
Things are very out of control.

145
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:10,029
你知道基地上正发生的事吗
Are you aware of what's happening on your base?

146
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,044
我正看着呢
I'm watching it with my own eyes.

147
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,071
联邦调查局被牵制住了
The FBI is pinned down.

148
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,041
他们说是来找生化武器的
They say they're looking for bioweapons.

149
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,028
先生  乔纳斯·霍奇斯手上持有

要是你们全都上了直升机

274
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,070
只要能确定武器的精确位置
a surgical air strike will work as long as

275
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,092
发动迅猛的空袭必能奏效
we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon.

276
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,099
你能做到吗
And you can do that?

277
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,036
是的  我相信我们能
Yes, I believe we can.

278
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,033
鲍尔先生  你看过

They look like, is that correct?

281
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,013
是的  总统阁下
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,043
一旦阿尔梅达找到毒气罐
Then we'll need you to verify the canisters

283
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,057
需要你去核实
Once Almeida has located them.

284
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,014
不得有误

00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,045
我现在快忙死了
It's kind of crazy here right now.

302
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,092
除非你有急事  我等会再打给你
Unless it's urgent, I gotta call you back.

303
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:08,002
我听说召开了参谋长联席会议
I'm hearing rumors that the joint chiefs have been called in.

304
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:10,042
没什么大事
It's not a big deal.

305
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,079
他们只是在降低警报等级前
They're just doing a final assessment

306
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,009
做最后评估
Before lowering the alert level.

307
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,046
奥利维亚  别来这套
Olivia, don't do this.

308
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,079
什么
What?

309
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,013
我说的是实话啊
I'm telling you the truth.

310
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,086
是吗
Really?

311
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:20,067
港务局集装箱堆积场的线人
Because I've got a source in the port authority

312
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:23,076
说的是大规模杀伤性武器
Container yard who's using terms like "weapons of mass destruction,"

313
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,021
自然我就会想
so naturally I'm wondering

314
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,054
这就是召开参谋长联席会议的原因吧
If that's why the joint chiefs are having a meeting.

315
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:30,001
听着  我对此无可奉告
Look, I can't talk about it.

316
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,018
这关系到国家安全
It's obviously a question of national security.

317
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,031
但我保证  我会第一时间告诉你
But you have my word I'll tell you soon as I can.

318
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,075
我现在就想知道
I want to know now.

319
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,025
肯  我可刚给了你一条爆炸性新闻
I just gave you a big story, Ken.

320
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:42,019
这次你得等了  我要挂了
You'll have to wait. I gotta go.

321
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:44,082
奥利维亚  别挂
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

322
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,099
否则你会后悔莫及
That'd be a big mistake.

323
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,069
你什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

324
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:52,063
好吧  这可是你逼我说的
You want me to say it, fine, I'll say it.

325
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,080
想想吧  要是你妈知道
Think how your mother would feel when she hears

326
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,033
是你逼走她的参谋长
That you forced out her chief of staff

327
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,081
而取而代之  她会作何感想
So you could take over his position.

328
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,084
是他自己无能
He was incompetent.

329
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,041
但早报不会这么写
Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news.

330
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,044
还是对我实话实说吧
So, talk to me.

331
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,038
就现在
Now.

332
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,098
我不能在这告诉你
I can't talk here.

333
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,075
我在罗斯福大陆酒店1271房间
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental, room 1271.

334
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:17,002
给你半小时时间
You've got half an hour.

335
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,017
皮尔斯探员  请给我备辆车
Agent Pierce, please get a car ready.

336
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,090
我有急事
I have to make a quick run.

337
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,034
杰克  我们到了
All right, Jack, we're here.

338
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,084
诺尔斯说这几天
Knowles says there's been increased activity

339
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,028
这片区域内活动频繁
In this area for several days now.

340
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,091
我看了约6栋建筑
I'm looking at about a half a dozen buildings.

341
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,035
每栋都有可能
Could be any one of them.

342
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,045
收到  托尼
Copy that, Tony.

343
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,005
别挂  红外线扫描中
Hold on, we're getting infrared up now.

344
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,039
我看到在你附近有7栋建筑
I'm counting seven buildings in your immediate vicinity.

345
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,002
你的正东南方向的建筑
The building directly southeast of your current

346
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,066
没有显示红外信号
Position is showing no infrared signal.

347
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,073
可能被屏蔽了
I'm guessing they're using a blackout shield.

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,003
好的  我们先去那看看
All right, we'll try there first.

349
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,093
路上有没有巡逻的
You see any patrols coming our way?

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,073
没有  很安全
Negative, you're clear.

351
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,067
好的  走吧
Okay, let's go.

352
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,095
杰克  诺尔斯的钥匙卡开不了门
Jack, Knowles' key card isn't working.

353
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,002
需要电子支持
We're gonna need electronic support here.

354
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,061
在你的通信装置背面
There should be an R-6 interface module

355
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:28,001
应该有个R-6接口模件
On the back of your comm device.

356
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,032
我知道那是什么  谢谢
Yeah, I know what that is, thank you.

357
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,000
我插进去了
I'm plugging in now.

358
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,007
好  开始
Okay, we're up.

359
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,050
是库马克Z系列
Cormac z series.

360
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,034
我们在解密5位数的电子钥匙
We're looking at a five digit key

361
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,008
它受高标加密模式下的分组密码保护
Protected by an AES block cipher.

362
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:46,091
正在解码
Running combinations.

363
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:49,041
托尼  有辆车正向你方驶来
Okay, Tony, you've got a vehicle coming your way.

364
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,065
在你东侧距离约100码
It's east of you about a hundred yards.

365
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,075
到下面找掩护
Take cover down there.

366
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,032
还有多久
How much longer?

367
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,008
你还需要多久
How much more time do you need?

368
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,099
5个数字才解出2个
I only have two out of five digits.

369
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,023
我们在这里完全无法隐蔽
We're pretty exposed here.

370
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,093
杰克
Jack?

371
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,085
我没事
It's all right, I'm fine.

372
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,067
快
Come on.

373
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,039
趴下
Stand down.

374
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,008
托尼  还差2个数字
Two more numbers, Tony.

375
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,079
我们该怎么办
What are we gonna do?

376
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,069
还差2个数没解出
We still got two digits to go.

377
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:34,006
靠近看看
Move in for a closer look.

378
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:35,066
我们躲不过了
We are not gonna make it.

379
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,086
待在这别动
Sit tight.

380
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:39,023
道格  你去哪  道格
Doug, where you-- Doug!

381
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,038
站住别动
Hold your position.

382
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,045
让我看看证件
May I see some ID?

383
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,072
道格·诺尔斯
Doug Knowles.

384
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,034
糟了
Dame it.

385
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,001
还差1个
One to go.

386
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,060
抱歉  诺尔斯先生
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

387
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,016
霍奇斯先生已经下令
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base

388
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,052
本基地所有无关人员不得擅闯
Cleared of all nonessential personnel.

389
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,017
无关人员
Nonessential personnel?

390
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:19,020
我是董事会主席
I'm chairman of the board.

391
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:22,027
我理解  可我们正处在高度戒备状态
I realize that, but we're dealing with a heightened security situation here.

392
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,094
所以我要知道您来这有何贵干
So, I need to know what you were doing in this area.

393
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:28,005
乔纳斯深夜召开董事会
Jonas called a late night board meeting,

394
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,043
所以我出现在这里
that's what I'm doing here.

395
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,038
先生  那会议12小时前就散了
Sir, that meeting ended nearly 12 hours ago.

396
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:34,062
完成  可以进去了
We got it; we're in.

397
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,019
我无须向你解释
I don't have to explain myself to you, you know.

398
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:40,029
抱歉  先生  可你必须解释
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.

399
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,069
先生  我想你没听懂我的话
Sir, I don't believe you're hearing me.

400
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,056
不  是你没有听懂我的话
No, I don't think you're hearing me!

401
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,040
是我建立了这家公司
I built this company!

402
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,033
不需要你来教我
And I don't need you telling me

403
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,047
我该去哪儿不该去哪儿
Where I can and cannot walk!

404
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:52,014
明白吗
Understood?!

405
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,090
先生  你得和我们走一趟
You're gonna have to come with me, sir.

406
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,061
这边走
Right this way.

407
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,031
我进来了
I'm in.

408
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,061
可他们带走了诺尔斯
But they got Knowles.

409
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,005
你觉得他会走漏消息吗
Do you think he's gonna say anything?

410
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,022
不清楚
I don't know.

411
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,069
不过我最好快进快出
But I better get in and out as fast as possible,

412
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,072
以防他泄露消息
just in case he does.

413
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,059
托尼  总统需要
Okay, Tony, the president needs a visual

414
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,008
在发动攻击前亲眼看到武器
On the weapons before she'll launch an attack.

415
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,088
她需要你亲眼看到毒气罐
She needs your eyes on the canisters

416
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,029
然后由杰克确认
and a confirmation by Jack.

417
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,076
收到
Copy that.

418
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,063
很好
Good.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
杰克

待在这  我马上回来
Stay here, i'll be right back.

421
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,008
杰克  杰克

422
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,094

424
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,035
杰克
Jack?

425
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,082
叫医护人员来
Get me the medic!

426
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,030
是  长官
Yes, sir.

427
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:55,000
我们刚发现诺尔斯先生一个人
We just found Mr. Knowles alone,

428
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,065
在禁区外面
Just outside the restricted zone.

429
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,081
他有合理解释吗
Did he have an explanation?

430
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:02,011
是的  长官  他说他在散步
Yes, sir, he said he was walking.

431
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,024
散步
Walking.

432
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,081
要把他带到斯多克斯那里接受审问吗
Should i take him to stokes for interrogation, sir?

433
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:10,088
兄弟  你是在建议我们把他五花大绑
You're suggesting what, soldier, that we strap him down,

434
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,092
逼他招供  就因为他在散步
Extract a confession, because he was walking?

435
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,009
他是董事会主席
He's the chairman of the board.

436
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,066
长官  我只是在请求指示
I was just requesting instructions, sir.

437
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,026
您要我怎么做
What you'd like done.

438
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,060
我要你把他带到他的办公室
I'd like you to take him to his office.

439
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,010
让他舒舒服服的
Make sure he's comfortable.

440
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,060
然后盯着他直到我过来
And stay with him until i arrive.

441
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,007
明白  长官
Yes, sir.

442
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,050
还有其他指示吗
Will that be all?

443
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,074
打给第9区
Call zone nine,

444
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,024
叫他们增加安检
Have them double down security.

445
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:35,014
我们得确认诺尔斯先生是一个人
Let's make sure that Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.

446
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:36,021
明白  长官
Yes, sir.

447
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,092
还要多久
How much longer?

448
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,043
半小时
Half an hour.

449
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,086
很好
Good.

450
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:57,063
完成后马上通知我
I'll need to know the minute it's done.

451
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,003
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

452
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:08,004
亚伦  可以的话你能在大厅等我吗
Aaron, i'd like you to wait in the hall, if that's okay.

453
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,085
泰勒女士  您让我负责您的安全
Ms. taylor, you tasked me with handling your security.

454
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:14,001
我不能让您进入
I can't allow you to enter a hotel room

455
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:16,008
我没有检查过的酒店房间
I haven't vetted.

456
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,072
亚伦  感谢你的关心

我也设了快速拨号

如果真有什么事  我会大声呼救的

我只需要两分钟去说服一个记者

真的  我不会有事的

-想喝点什么  -不用了

00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,079
我想你应该不介意我喝点儿吧
I assume you don't mind if i do.

465
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,010
漫长的一天
It's been a day.

466
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,057
我得告诉你
I gotta tell you.

467
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,017
我不喜欢别人威胁我
I don't like being threatened.

我知道不合适宜
It was unfortunate.

00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,004
肯  我们是老相识了
We've known each other a long time, Ken.

471
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,061
我本以为我们已经达成一项共识
I thought we had an understanding.

472
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,008
是达成了
We do.

473
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:19,055
我也很想继续这样
And i want to keep it that way.

474
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,085
我们俩都这么想的  对吗
We both do. am i right?

475
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:28,049
好吧  我跟你说过  我收到线报
Okay, so, i told you, i have this source.

476
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,099
线人是港务局集装箱堆积场的警察
Cop,out at the port authority container yard.

477
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,033
嗯
Okay.

478
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,086
他跟我说他看见一些貌似职业杀手的人
He told me he saw these professional assassin types

479
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,020
几个小时前在那里激烈交火
Get into an intense firefight out there a couple hours ago.

480
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,074
据他讲  有人劫持了一批大规模杀伤性武器
According to him, someone hiJacked a WMD

481
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,027
不知道要运往何处

482
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:44,007
是这样
That's true.

483
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,054
是吗
Yeah.

484
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:47,011
我想知道所有情况
Yeah, i want to know all about it.

485
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,068
如果你觉得你只需要点点头
Look, if you think all you've got to do is nod your head

486
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,002
来确认我已经知道的消息  那是不行的
Confirming what i already know, then we've got a problem.

487
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,039
事关国家安全  肯
It's national security, Ken.

488
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:00,069
我无可奉告
I can't tell you.

489
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,059
我说你可以
I'm saying you can.

490
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:05,076
如果这个消息外传  会造成恐慌
If this story breaks, it would create a panic.

491
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,084
人们会受到伤害
People would be hurt.

492
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,030
如果你知道内情  你就会明白
If you knew what it was, you'd understand why

493
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,030
为什么要严格保密了
It's got to stay a secret.

494
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,097
没错  就是这样  我会理解的
Right, exactly. i'd understand.

495
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:16,014
相信我  好吗
Have a little faith, okay?

496
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:22,011
好吧  在集装箱堆积场里有生化武器
All right. there is a bioweapon in the container yard.

497
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,008
那群人就是在争夺这个东西
That's what they were fighting over.

498
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:26,041
它是由斯塔克伍德在非洲研制的
It was developed by Starkwood in Africa.

499
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,055
-斯塔克伍德  -没错
- Starkwood? - Right.

500
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:31,045
他们已将武器运到离这里30英里的基地
They moved it to their base about 30 miles from here.

501
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,029
这么说武器现在就在那里了
So it's there right now.

502
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:43,053
这就是联席参谋长会议讨论对策的主题
So this is what the joint chiefs are discussing, what to do about that.

503
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,093
奥利维亚
Olivia...

504
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:57,004
总统已下令  一旦发现毒气罐的位置
The president ordered an air strike

505
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:02,018
就马上进行空中打击
As soon as the exact location of the canisters was known.

506
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,015
现在你明白为什么不能报导此事了吧
So you see why you can't run with this?

507
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:11,002
真的  肯  你不能报导的
Really, Ken, you can't.

508
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,019
很多人的生命岌岌可危
A lot of lives are at stake.

509
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,069
整个计划成功的关键就在于奇袭
The entire plan depends on surprise.

510
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,023
你明白的  对吧
You get that, right?

511
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,067
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

512
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,084
也许我不应该报导
Maybe i need to kill this story.

513
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:30,009
谢谢
Thank you.

514
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:35,002
我的意思是  也许应该有人来说服我
What i mean is maybe somebody could convince me.

515
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,035
你什么意思
What are you saying?

516
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,066
你知道我的意思
You know what i'm saying.

517
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,082
你发扬爱国精神的时候  真的很美
You're very beautiful when you get all patriotic.

518
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,009
我有跟你说过吗
I ever tell you that?

519
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,019
我们已经结束了  我们都同意了
That's over. we agreed.

520
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,050
是你一厢情愿
You agreed.

521
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:52,000
真的  我不想这样
Really, i don't want to do this.

522
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,047
肯
Ken...

523
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,027
那就拒绝我吧
Then say no.

524
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,079
这是盘多帕敏  能控制发抖的症状
This is Pandopamine which should control the shaking.

525
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,036
按住
Here, apply pressure.

526
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:23,036
你可以每隔两小时  注射一次
You can give yourself an injection once every two hours.

527
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:24,050
如有需要  可增加次数
More if needed.

528
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,010
你觉得我会需要更多的注射吗
You think i'll need more?

529
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,047
十有八九  是的
In all likelihood, yes.

530
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:30,077
在接触生化剂后这么快就出现症状
The onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests

531
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:33,027
说明生化剂比我们想的要厉害得多
The bio-agent is more virulent than we thought.

532
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,071
我们所做的只是控制症状而已
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.

533
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,011
我明白
I understand.

534
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,005
不过有件事你也许会考虑一下
There's something you may want to consider, though.

535
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,095
什么事
What's that?

536
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,098
布莱登大学一直资助朊病毒疾病的研究
Bryden University has been funding some studies on prion diseases.

537
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,085
该研究目前尚处试验阶段
The work is purely experimental at this point,

538
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,026
但它的确提出了治疗方法
but it does suggest treatment.

539
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:49,046
这是好消息啊
That's good news.

540
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,049
我不想让你们抱太大希望
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up here.

541
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,073
因为治愈的几率很小
We're talking a slight chance.

542
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,030
治疗方法采用干细胞
A possible treatment using stem cells

543
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,060
需从基因匹配的捐赠者身上提取
From a genetically compatible donor.

544
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,093
直系亲属是最好的捐赠人选
An immediate family member would make the best donor candidate.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,007
我看了你的档案
I saw your file.

546
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,004
你有个女儿  对吧
It says you have a daughter, right?

547
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,097
我不想让我的女儿牵涉进来
I don't want my daughter involved in this.

548
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,034
-杰克  如果真有机会治疗  -鲍尔先生
- Jack, if there's a chance. - Mr. Bauer...

549
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,051
医生  谢谢你所做的一切
Doctor, thank you for everything you've done.

550
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,075
抱歉  我得回去做事了
Excuse me. i need to get back to work.

551
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:18,005
杰克
Jack...

552
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:20,027
这不关你的事
This is none of your business.

553
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,000
你在调查局里病情发作
It's my business when you're having a seizure

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,032
-这就关我的事  -你听到医生的话了
- In the middle of the FBI. - You heard the doctor.

555
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,069
治疗只是抑制了病症
The medication will mask the symptoms.

556
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,019
你为什么就不愿意谈一下呢
Why won't you even talk about this?

557
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,023
-谈什么  -实验治疗疗程
- Talk about what? - The experimental procedure.

558
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,086
因为没什么好谈的
Because there's nothing to talk about.

559
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,077
她是你女儿  你难道不打算让她知道吗
She's your daughter, and you're not even gonna let her know?

560
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,074
对
That's right.

561
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,094
你甚至连试一试都不愿意吗
So you're just not even gonna try?

562
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:39,036
蕾妮  我知道你想帮我
Renee, i know you're trying to help,

563
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,054
但你不了解情况
But you don't know what you're talking about here.

564
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:44,021
我女儿跟我都不说话的  明白吗
My daughter and i, we don't talk, okay?

565
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,075
所以  请你不要再管了
So, please, just let it go.

566
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:51,022
这应该由她来决定
It should be her choice.

567
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,042
不是
Well, it's not.

568
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:57,022
我才是快死的那个  该由我来决定
I'm the one who's dying. it's my choice.

569
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:05,013
还没有发现目标  托尼正在寻找
No sign of the target yet, but Tony's working on it.

570
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,073
你看起来好多了
You look better.

571
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,037
谢谢
Thanks.

572
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,024
托尼  听得到吗
Tony, can you hear me?

573
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,064
杰克  你没事吧
Jack, you okay?

574
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,017
我没事
Yeah, i'm fine.

575
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,051
托尼  我们看到大楼外面有人来了
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new activity outside the building.

576

两辆车  8个敌人
Two vehicles, eight hostiles.

577
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:20,071
看起来像支安保小队
Looks like a security detail.

578
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,022
你觉得诺尔斯出卖他了吗
You think Knowles gave him up?

579
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,025
托尼  他们直奔你所在的入口了

8个敌人正向你方逼近
Eight hostiles and closing.

581
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,013
我听到他们的声音了
Yeah, i hear them.

582
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,023
你想要重新部署吗
You want to regroup?

583

不  我想赶快了结这件事
No, i want to get this over with.

他们刚派了我们8个人过来
They just sent eight of us over here, sir.

589
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,026
为什么  出什么事了

没事  只是谨慎起见
No, sir. just, you know, precautions.

591
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,020
没错  没错  疑神疑鬼的还不够啊

你在平均海平面125英尺处
I've got you at 125 feet MSL,

对  我在地下四层

做好这件事  这是你们的任务

双方已经开战  道格

你不能和政府作对啊

有高射炮威胁的可能性吗

我不清楚

总统阁下  走到今天这一步

最好赶快召回您的战斗机

00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:55,080
你没资格发最后通牒  霍奇斯先生
You're in no position to issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

774
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:58,060
或许我有

775
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:01,067
总统阁下  记得几年前

00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,081
我反对那次部署

结果您输了

780

您应该也还记得

对准我国东海岸

786
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,056
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

787
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:30,017
为了表示诚意
As a sign of good faith,

788
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:34,047
我让您见识下  证明我并非虚张声势

看见了吗
You see that?

790
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,028
总统阁下
Madam president?

791
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,052
这就是你表示诚意的方式吗
You call this good faith?

792
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:54,079
你是要对自己国家开战啊  乔纳斯
You are waging war on your own country, Jonas.

793
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,036
当然了  我可不这么想
Well, of course, I wouldn't see it that way.

794
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:00,096
你到底想怎样
What do you want?

795
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:06,007
一会到了白宫我们再谈
Well, we can have that conversation a little later on at the White House.

796
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:09,057
你觉得我们能这么坐下来谈吗
You think we're going to just sit down and discuss this?

797
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:11,094
是的  就在您的总统办公室里

798

799
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:17,088
但同时  我觉得

800
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:19,005
美国人民不知道
To both of our advantage

801
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,025
你我相持不下的局面
That the American people do not know

对我们两个都有好处

803
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:26,089
所以您要对此次会晤守口如瓶

并且召回战斗机

您要是不答应的话  总统阁下

我就别无选择  只能发射那些导弹
