00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:17,020

00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,080

一个前ctu探员帮他的

他叫杰克·鲍尔

00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,062
鲍尔
Bauer?!

108

我们几小时前下达了一个传票

让他从听证会脱身  以便帮助我们

113
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,040
抓住阿尔梅达

你的意思是说这俩人现在联合了

看起来是这样的
It would appear so.

00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,037
天啊  你跟你的人

真的把事情搞砸了  莫斯探员

没有阿尔梅达  我们就没办法找到杜巴库

119
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:31,071
也没机会重获cip装置

120
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,068
伊桑  咱们停留在重点上

能从医院方面知道

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,083
没有的  女士
No, ma'am. not really.

129
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,083
我要说清楚的是  莫斯探员

130
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,036
抓到阿尔梅达和鲍尔

00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,080
不仅仅是你当前最重要的任务
Isn't just your top priority,

132
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,037
它是你唯一的任务

133
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,053
明白  女士
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,034
和我们保持联系  探员
Keep us posted, agent.

135
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,024
我们要做好他们不能
Bottom line: The bureau is not going to be the answer

136
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,028
-解决问题的准备  -这是完全有可能的

137
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,041
我们还有多少时间
How much time does that leave us?

138
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,071
不到两小时了
Less than two hours.

139
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:10,028
杜巴库的要求是我方部队
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat

00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,019
要在24小时之内后撤到子午线23度以外
Behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.

141
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,089
现在  为了保证行动的时效性

142
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,042

00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:20,013
最迟必须在1点钟前开始撤离
Must start withdrawing by 1:00, at the latest.

144
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:22,043
这意味着我们在非洲的行动难以维续了
Which would effectively end our mission in africa

145
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:24,033
同时也使得另外的10万桑加拉国的人民处于

146
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,033
危险境地之中
To a certain and brutal death.

147
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,037
但如果您执意要继续军事行动
On the other hand, if you authorize the invasion,

148
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,069
杜巴库会毫不犹豫地使用手中的CIP装置
Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the cip device.

149
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:39,034
联邦航空局何时才能把飞机都全部降落下来

仍然有1000多架飞机

151
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:44,038
在我国上空等待降落
Across the country waiting for clearance to land.

152
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,002
杜巴库可以随时让它们中的
Dubaku could bring down

153
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:47,065
任何一架坠毁
Any one of them at any moment.

154
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,029
或者
Or...

155
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,079
甚至用那个装置去造成更恐怖的袭击
Use the device for something far worse.

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,056
作为一个总统  我的信条
I ran for office on the principle

157
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:57,056
之一就是绝不向恐怖分子妥协
Of non-negotiation with terrorists.

158
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,030
我怎么可能第一次遇到困难
How can I abandon that now,

159
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,030
就放弃这个信念
The very first time I'm tested?

160
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,037
并且如果我这样做
And, if I do so, won't I be telling dubaku,

161
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:04,097
不就等于告诉杜巴库和全世界
And the rest of the world,

162
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,081
要挟美国政府行得通吗
That blackmailing america works?

163
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,047
总统阁下
Madame president,

164
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,031
这是以后的问题
Those are questions for the future.

165
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:13,072
我们现在必须做决定
We have a decision to make now.

166
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,023
这是哪里
What do you call this place?

167
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:29,043
我们把这里当做是反恐组
We like to think of it as ctu.

168
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,084
至少是一些反恐组剩下的东西
What's left of it, anyway.

169
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,024
杰克
Jack...

170
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,001
克罗依
Chloe.

171
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,001
真高兴能再见到你
It's good to see you.

172
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,031
我也是
It's good to see you, too.

173
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:47,045
我很高兴你能站到我们这边
I'm glad you're with us.

174
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,075
我现在不属于任何一边
I'm not with anyone until someone starts

175
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,025
除非你们能够给我一个满意的答复
Answering some questions.

176
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,058
不如从你开始吧
Might as well start with you.

177
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,062
你怎么又活过来了
Why the hell are you not dead?

178
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,079
我当时确实死了
I was dead, jack.

179
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,012
死了十分钟
For almost ten minutes.

180
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,033
这是后来别人告诉我的
Or so I was told.

181
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,046
谁
By who?

182
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,067
这个人
By him.

183
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,093
他叫大卫·爱默生
His name's david emerson.

184
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,030
我不知道他在反恐组买通了谁
I don't know who he paid off at ctu,

185
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,017
但却是他的手下给我
But it was his people who injected my body

186
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,044
注射了一种低温药物
With a hypothermic compound,

187
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:15,067
把我救了过来
And was able to revive me.

188
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,038
他是谁  想干什么
Who is he and what does he want?

189
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,084
他似乎是一个人单干
Independent contractor.

190
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,005
吸纳退伍军人和情报人员
Enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives,

191
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,051
替客户卖命
Jobs them out to clients.

192
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,015
显然  我符合条件
Apparently, I fit the profile.

193
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,058
什么条件
What profile?

194
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:26,075
做过特工
Former employees

195
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:28,085
对政府充满怨恨
With grievances against the federal government.

196
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:30,076
自从我离开反恐组
Emerson had been keeping

197
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:33,019
爱默生一直在关注我
Tabs on me ever since I left ctu.

198
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,089
米歇尔被杀后
After michelle was killed...

199
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,073
他觉得招收我的机会到了
He figured I'd make a good recruit.

200
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,053
特别是其它人都认为我死了
And everyone else thinking you're dead,

201
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:42,027
这就再好不过
So much the better.

202
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,040
-没错  -从那时起你就
-  Yeah. - And since then, you've been

203
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,021
一直在为揭发他而当卧底
Working undercover to expose his operation?

204
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,045
不是  杰克
No, jack.

205
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,046
什么
What?

206
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:59,009
我当时确实在为他卖命
I was really working for him.

207
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,002
我恨
I was angry.

208
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:06,023
我恨联邦政府夺走了我的一切
I hated the federal government for what it took from me.

209
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:11,090
这三年来我替爱默生领导一支队伍
I ran emerson's crew for more than three years.

210
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,031
我干了很多令人不齿的事情
And I did some pretty bad things.

211
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:23,088
那你是怎么转变过来的
What made you turn against him?

212
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,088
因为CIP装置
The cip device.

213
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,088
爱默生让我的队伍
Emerson had my crew

214
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,096
去偷需要的部件以侵入防火墙  我知道这样做的结果
Stealing components to breach the firewall. I knew what that meant

215
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:36,005
无辜的美国人可能会因此丧命
Innocent americans would die.

216
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,056
-我不是为他来做这种事  -托尼  你太混了
-  And I didn't signed up for that. damn it, tony!

217
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,092
你为什么不让当局来处理
Why didn't you call the authorities?

218
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,066
-他做不到  杰克  -为什么
- He couldn't, jack. - Why not?

219
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,080
他发现爱默生的客户正是杜巴库
He found out emerson's client was dubaku.

220
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:48,040
你认为政府里有人已被他收买了
That's who you believe has agents inside the government.

221
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,064
朱玛独裁政府控制了桑加拉丰富的钻石资源
The juma regime controls sangala's vast diamond wealth.

222
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,057
他正在大肆贿赂政府人员
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.

223
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,091
政府的腐败程度有多深
How widespread is the corruption?

224
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:57,008
随处可见
Pervasive.

225
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,058
这就是托尼找我的原因
That's why tony came to me.

226
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:01,011
因为他不知道这件事的覆盖面有多广
He didn't know how far or high up this thing went.

227
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:03,001
杰克  杜巴库是整件事的关键
Dubaku is the key to this thing, jack.

228
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,095
如果我们想挫败他们的阴谋
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy,

229
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:07,025
就必须在他离开美国前抓住他
We have to get to him before he leaves the u.s.

230
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,026
所以我必须尽快回去做卧底
That's why I have to get back under as soon as possible.

231
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,099
我和我手下马上就要
There's a new job in the pipeline

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,099
接手一项新任务  我还不清楚细节
For me and my crew-- I don't have all the details,

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,036
但我肯定
But I do know that it'll get me in the same room

234
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:17,050
能和杜巴库会面
With dubkau himself.

235
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,076
现在的问题是我们如何
The challenge is going to be

236
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:20,020
让托尼回到爱默生的团队中去
Reinstalling tony with emerson.

237
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,047
我们必须先假定
We have to assume

238
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,014
爱默生已经知道托尼被捕  要让他相信
Emerson knew tony was in fbi custody and somehow

239
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,057
-托尼是逃出来  -爱默生会认为
- Managed to escape. - Emerson's going to think

240
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,081
托尼和美国政府达成了一项交易
Tony made a deal with the u.s. attorney.

241
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,068
没错
That's right.

242
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,012
我可以帮你们解决这个问题
I can help you with this.

243
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,000
是的  你可以
Yes, you can.

244
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,069
除了你们三个
Outside of the three of you,

245
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,016
还有谁被牵扯了进来
Who else is involved in this operation?

246
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,023
没别人
It's just us.

247
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:53,007
就我们几个
This is it.

248
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,014
你们至少要让我
Please, at least tell me

249
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,014
掌握一些这个阴谋存在的证据
That you've got some proof that this conspiracy exists.

250
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,021
我们有证据
Yes, we do.

251
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,071
但不过是些皮毛
But only at the lowest level.

252
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,092
当前只得到一些表面的东西
At this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface.

253
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:16,052
好吧
Okay.

254
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,093
我和你们合作
I'll work with you.

255
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,076
但只因当前你们是
But only because, right now,

256
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:24,017
我唯一能够信任的人
You are the only people that I trust.

257
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:27,027
但如果你们让我稍有质疑
You give me one reason to question that,

258
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:28,093
我发誓我会告发你们
And I swear I will turn you in.

259
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,050
明白吗
You understand?

260
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:32,067
好吧
All right.

261
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:35,072
克罗依  准备好和爱默生的通话线路
Chloe, set up the call with emerson.

262
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,034
我找到两个雇佣兵
I found two freelancers who might work.

263
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:39,038
前游骑兵团成员
Ex-rangers.

264
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,095
-可靠吗  -当然
- You trust them? - yeah.

265
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:42,091
我和他们合作过  铁哥们
I've worked with them before. they're close.

266
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,092
里塔维克也认识他们
Litvak knows them, too.

267
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,058
-那好  -他们在加入之前
- Okay. they may want to know

268
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,025
想知道任务内容
More about the job before they sign on.

269
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,055
他们只需知道能拿到多少钱就够了
Only thing they need to know is what it pays.

270
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,013
好吧
All right.

271
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,089
喂
Yeah?

272
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,090
是我
It's me.

273
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,044
托尼
Tony.

274
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,064
你在哪里
Where are you?

275
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,040
我在一个停车场  正在设法弄辆车
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.

276
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,097
我从联调局逃了出来
I got away from the fbi.

277
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,041
嗯  我听说了
Yeah, I heard.

278
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,098
还听说是杰克·鲍尔把你弄了出来
I also heard it was jack bauer who broke you out.

279
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,011
没错
That's right.

280
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,058
这事没道理  托尼
That doesn't make any sense, tony.

281
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,041
鲍尔替他们工作  他帮他们抓到了你
Bauer's working for them. he helped capture you.

282
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,042
那时他别无选择
It's only because he didn't have a choice.

283
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,062
他现在站在我们这边
He's on board now.

284
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:21,005
站在我们这边是什么意思
What do you mean "on board"?

285
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,092
今天发生在参议院听证会的事情你听说了吧
You heard about the senate hearings this morning?

286
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,056
他们要给他判刑
They're going to file criminal charges against him.

287
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:26,089
我告诉鲍尔  如果他帮我们完成这项任务
I told bauer that if he helped us out with the mission,

288
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,049
你可以帮他离开这个国家
You could get him out of the country.

289
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,026
大卫  如果不是杰克的话
Look, david, if it weren't for jack,

290
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,090
我还会被他们关着
I'd still be in custody.

291
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,017
我这么跟你说  我觉得我们可以利用他
We can use him, I'm telling you.

292
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,013
现在情况有变  托尼
I don't know, tony.

293
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:38,030
摩根已经雇了新人
Morgan's hiring new men now.

294
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,067
摩根是个小角色
Morgan's a thug.

295
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,021
没法让他指挥这么重要的行动
He can't run point on something this important.

296
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,067
还是按计划由我来执行吧
Let me do it like we planned.

297
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,029
鲍尔可以替代坦纳  这样就没问题了
Bauer can take tanner's place and we're good to go.

298
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,001
好吧  把鲍尔带过来
All right, bring bauer.

299
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,058
我们在Chesterfield 2211号
We're at 2211 chesterfield.

300
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,082
诺兰路边上
Right off nolan.

301
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,018
明白
Got it.

302
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,052
他信了吗
He buy it?

303
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,063
等会就知道了
We'll see.

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,059
泰勒先生  听说你在找我
Mr. taylor, I understand you were looking for me.

305
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,012
没错  盖吉探员  我想出去一下
Yes, agent gedge, I have to go out

306
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,022
需要一辆车
And I'm going to need some transportation.

307
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,003
没问题  我们要去哪里
Certainly. Where will we be going?

308
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:46,056
路上再说
I'll direct you on the way.

309
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,003
我得在行程单上写明目的地  先生
I need a destination for the manifest, sir.

310
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,070
和往常一样  不用行程单
As before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest.

311
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,027
而且这次不要司机  就我们两个
And no driver this time, just you and me.

312
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,014
泰勒先生  我们不是说好有话直说吗
I thought we were through with all the subterfuge, mr. taylor.

313
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,038
照我吩咐的去做
Please just do as I ask.

314
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,092
对不起  先生  除非您给我个理由
I'm sorry, sir, not without an explanation.

315
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,058
我们去见萨曼莎·罗斯
It's samantha roth.

316
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,055
她说她要告诉我关于我儿子死亡的新消息
She says she has new information

317
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,095
是关于我儿子的死因的
Regarding my son's death.

318
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,049
泰勒先生
Mr. taylor...

319
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,032
我也以为这事过去了  相信我
I thought I was done with this, too, believe me.

320
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,046
不是我起的头
I didn't initiate this.

321
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,020
她打电话给我的
She called me.

322
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:21,006
布莱恩
Brian...

323
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:25,057
我知道报告我先前的行踪是你的职责所在
I know you felt obligated to report my prior activities--

324
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:28,090
这也是正确的  但是我还是希望
And rightly so-- but I would still like to think

325
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:31,036
在需要你对我的忠诚的时候  你能做到
That I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it.

326
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:38,041
我会丢了饭碗的  先生
I could lose my job, sir.

327
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:42,048
这是最后一次了  我保证
This will be the last time. I promise.

328
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,002
亨利
Henry?

329
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,032
求你了
Please.

330
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:50,013
安排好车  我会马上打电话给你

谁啊
Who was that?

333
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,047
工作人员  没什么
Staff, nothing.

334
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,097
能帮我戴上么
Here, can you help me with this?

335
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,050
当然
Sure.

336
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,094
是爸爸给我的礼物
It was a gift from my father.

337
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:03,010
你记得吗
You remember? mm-hmm.

338
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,099
就是我赢回他参议院席位的那天
On the day I won back his seat in the senate.

339
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,081
总理马托波想要见我
Prime minister matobo has asked to see me.

340
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,055
他想要知道
He's going to want to know

341
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,048
为什么我还没下令进兵
Why I haven't authorized the invasion yet.

342
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,083
那你怎么跟他说
What are you going to tell him?

343
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,012
我也不知道
I don't know.

344
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:21,042
美国人民选你
The american people elected you

345
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,089
是因为他们相信你的判断力  艾莉森
Because they trust your judgment, allison,

346
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,096
而且他们相信你
And they're going to trust you

347
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,080
会在这件事上做出正确决定的
To make the right call on this, too.

348
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,087
可我不知道什么才是正确的决定
I don't know what the right call is.

349
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,095
正确的决定
The right call...

350
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:36,005
就是你做的任何一个决定
Is whatever you decide it is.

351
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,091
有多少外勤小队
How many units in the field?

352
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:42,051
十七个  能上的都上了
17-- all available agents are deployed.

353
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:43,098
扩大搜索网  必须假想鲍尔和阿尔梅达
Widen the grid-- we have to assume

354
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:46,025
已经逃出了我们的搜索范围
Bauer and almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.

355
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:48,046
这就办
On it.

356
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,075
西恩·希林格
Sean hillinger.

357
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,099
西恩  是我
Sean, its me.

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,022
克里斯蒂娜
Christina.

359
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,066
-你在哪啊  -我在飞机上呢
-Where are you? -I'm calling from the plane.

360
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,053
你的飞机还没降落吗
You haven't landed yet?

361
00:14:57,054 --> 00:15:00,083
没呢  飞行员说我们在等待航线
No, th-the pilot says we're in a holding pattern...

362
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:03,000
但是我们就是在这一圈一圈地转
But we just keep circling and circling,

363
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,013
而且我能从窗户里看到其它的飞机
And I can see other planes out the window, too--

364
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:07,044
至少有八九架呢
Eight or nine, at least.

365
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,034
克里斯蒂娜  宝贝  放松些
Christina, sweetheart, relax.

366
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:11,061
但是坐我旁边的女人说
But the woman sitting next to me says

367
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:13,051
她听说有两架飞机差点相撞
She heard something about a near miss

368
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:16,074
还听说航管系统也有问题
And a problem with the air traffic control system.

369
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:20,005
西恩  你知道这些情况吗
Sean, do you know anything about this?

370
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,042
是的  都是事实
Yeah, it's true.

371
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:23,062
航管局已经限飞了一些飞机
The FAA has grounded some planes, but it's only

372
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:26,012
但只是预防措施罢了
A precaution.

373
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,012
真的吗
Really?

374
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,076
对  其实是个无关的事故
Yeah, it was an isolated incident.

375
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:31,056
你会没事的
You're going to be fine.

376
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,013
好吧
Okay.

377
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:35,070
我只是  有些担心
I just... I got worried there for a minute.

378
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,073
你了解我的
You know how I am.

379
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,097
我了解你
I do.

380
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:41,004
听我说  飞机一落地你就给我打电话
Now, listen, I want you to call me as soon as you land.

381
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,027
我会的
I will.

382
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,011
我爱你
I love you.

383
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,095
我也爱你
I love you, too.

384
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,092
你老婆啊
Was that your wife?

385
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,062
詹尼斯告诉我  你老婆的飞机还没落地
Janis told me her plane's still in the air.

386
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:55,025
你没事吧
You okay?

387
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:58,082
一个疯子在那有能力随意
Okay, there's a maniac out there with the capability

388
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,046
损毁飞机  所以  不  艾瑞卡
Of bringing down planes at will, so, no, erika,

389
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,073
我有事  她的飞机排到第18个降落
I'm not okay. her flight is number 18

390
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:07,000
至少还要2个小时
In the queue, so it'll be another two hours, at least,

391
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:09,006
她才能够安全
Before hers gets clearance.

392
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,030
抱歉
I'm sorry.

393
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:12,033
我能做点什么吗
Is there anything I can do?

394
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:15,084
没有
No.

395
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:19,038
不能  我们无能为力  这就是问题所在
No, there's nothing anybody can do; that's the problem.

396
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,055
对  她就在这  我告诉她
Yeah, she's right here. I'll let her know.

397
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,068
谢谢  再见
Thank you, bye-bye.

398
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,085
蕾妮
Renee.

399
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:29,018
我刚跟医院通过电话
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

400
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,018
坦纳恢复知觉了
Tanner's regained consciousness.

401
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,072
他能说话吗
Is he well enough to talk?

402
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,019
已经好到可以叫医生替他打电话了
He's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him.

403
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,032
他打给谁了
Who did he call?

404
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,093
盖奇·惠特尼·佩斯  我想是律师事务所吧
Gage whitney pace, which is a law firm, I think.

405
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,049
华盛顿第二大的
The second largest in dc.

406
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,066
带上你的本本跟我走  詹尼斯
Go grab your laptop, janis. you're coming with me.

407
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,003
我吗
I am?

408
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,043
-为什么  -因为我们必须赶在坦纳的律师
-Why?-because we have to get to tanner

409
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,050
到之前赶到医院
before his lawyers do

410
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,087
如果我能从他那得到阿尔梅达所在位置
And because if I can get almeida's location out of him,

411
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,047
我要你把消息马上传达到外勤小组手里
I want you on-site to vet the intelligence to our field teams.

412
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,092
-快去  -好吧
-Go. -okay.

413
00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:01,022
跟我讲讲爱默生
Tell me about emerson.

414
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:05,022
他是英国人  前英国空军特种兵

415
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,006
惯于城市作战  擅长狙击和近距离格斗
Urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat.

416
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,086
看过他在贝鲁特和摩加迪沙的行动
Saw action in beirut and mogadishu.

417
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,086
那他很强咯
So he's good.

418
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,056
相当的强
Extremely.

419
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,026
但是他不是什么怪人或者理学家
But he's not some wack job or ideologue.

420
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:20,020
他这人就两条  钱和个人忠诚
He's about two things-- money and personal loyalty.

421
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,037
看起来你仍然很崇拜他
Sounds like you still admire him.

422
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,064
听着  杰克
Listen, jack,

423
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,021
当我孤苦伶仃之时
He treated me like a brother

424
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:27,001
他对我情同兄弟
When I thought I had nobody else.

425
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,098
这样会有问题吗
Is this going to be a problem?

426
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,029
不会
No.

427
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:37,045
我知道在这件事上他做错了
I know he's on the wrong side of this.

428
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,090
我会公事公办的
I'll do what has to be done.

429
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:00,032
我们到了
We're here.

430
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:14,026
爱默生在哪
Where's emerson?

431
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,026
在里面
Inside.

432
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,060
进来吧
Come in.

433
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,040
大卫
David.

434
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,088
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

435
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:33,008
把鲍尔带到楼下  我要跟托尼谈谈
Take mr. bauer downstairs. I need to talk to tony.

436
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,039
怎么了
What's going on?

437
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,060
带鲍尔来是不是太冒险了
Bringing in bauer is not worth the risk.

438
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,094
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

439
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,031
请坐
Have a seat.

440
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:02,048
爱默生一会就来见你
Emerson will be right with you.

441
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,088
如果不是他  我还被FBI关着呢
I'd still be in fbi custody if it wasn't for him.

442
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,045
托尼  你已经暴露了
Tony, you already made your case.

443
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,092
我们可以利用他
We can use him.

444
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:19,003
这个我考虑过  但我另有妙计
I considered it... but I'm going a different way.

445
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,066
我欠他的  大卫
I owe him, david.

446
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,013
你明白吗
You understand that?

447
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:26,049
我明白  我很赞赏你对朋友的忠诚
Yeah, and I appreciate your sense of loyalty.

448
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,063
始终如一  但你得公事公办  托尼
I always have, but this is business, tony.

449
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:31,087
你不能找个不明身份的杰克·鲍尔
You can't have a... an unknown factor like jack bauer

450
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,001
来搅局
Coming in and messing things up.

451
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,052
那怎么办  你要杀了他
So, what, you're going to kill him?

452
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:45,069
不  你去杀
No, you are.

453
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,088
他们要杀了他
They're going to kill him.

454
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,082
他会逃脱的
He'll get out of it.

455
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,082
-如果不能呢  -那杰克的死
-What if he can't? -then jack's death

456
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,019
会巩固托尼的身份
Solidifies tony's position in the crew.

457
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,066
托尼曾经被FBI拘留过
Tony was in fbi custody.

458
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,083
如果他自己回到那了
If he'd gone back in there by himself,

459
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:02,096
怀疑会落到他一个人头上
The suspicion would have rested on him alone.

460
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:05,023
现在分散到杰克身上了
So by deflecting it onto jack...

461
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,068
我们就可以保持托尼的卧底身份
We keep tony's cover viable.

462
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,081
你早预料到这个结局了
You knew this might happen the whole time.

463
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:12,045
是
Yes.

464
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:16,052
杰克也预料到了
So did jack.

465
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,090
放下你的武器
Put your weapon down!

466
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:42,025
放下武器  不然我就杀了他
Put your weapon down or I will kill him!

467
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:45,067
我是来做事的  不是来被你出卖的
I came here to do a job, not be double-crossed by you.

468
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,068
你们已经人手不足了
You're already shorthanded.

469
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:51,051
你需要精兵强将  不是这俩窝囊废
You need good men, not like these two traffic cops.

470
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:54,062
看看我是怎么收拾他们的
Look what I've done to them.

471
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,095
我来这是因为我无路可走了
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.

472
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,029
托尼说如果我帮你
Tony said if I helped you,

473
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,050
你可以帮我逃出这个国家
You could get me out of the country.

474
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:06,034
你要是不信我的话  就开枪吧
Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.

475
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:17,021
搞什么  你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?!

476
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:18,044
杀了他
Kill him!

477
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,082
不
No.

478
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,042
杀了他  否则我就不干了
Kill him or I'm out of here.

479
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:33,086
好吧
Fine.

480
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,066
枪留着
Keep it.

481
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:20,015
好吧  让112号航班
Right, I need flight 112 reassigned

482
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:21,052
立即降落
For immediate landing.

483
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:24,086
你请求112号航班在洛杉矶外
So you're requesting a priority landing for flight 112

484
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,069
-优先降落吗  -这不是请求
Out of las vegas? this is not a request.

485
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:29,023
这是给你转达白宫发出的紧急协议
I'm forwarding an urgent protocol from the white house.

486
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:32,023
您的名字是

拉里·莫斯  我是负责此事的探员

你是想召回特遣部队

我还没打定主意

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,039
杜巴库所掌握的这种设备

对你的人民造成了

朱玛的军队正向难民营推进

请原谅  我还有事

00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,011
卡桑加难民的情况吗
To know about the refugees in kasanga?

538
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,048
总统阁下  您没必要
Madame president, you have enough to think about

539
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,095
在这种小事上浪费心思
Without being burdened with details.

540
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,082
尤其是这种
Especially details that might push me toward

541
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:07,059
会将我卷入战争的小事
Proceeding with the invasion.

542
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:10,026

546
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:20,053
这是唯一的出路

547
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,070
照杜巴库要求的做
Comply with dubaku's demands.

548
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,014

该死  伊桑  你也听见马托波说的了

你想让我重演猪湾事件吗

肯尼迪能在其中幸存

556
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:44,029

放在首位

对其发号施令吗
To dictate its foreign policy

563
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,047
这是一个超级大国应该做得吗
does a superpower do that?

564
00:25:57,047 --> 00:26:00,071
是的  在没有其他选择余地时
Yes, if there's no other option.

565
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:03,037
而如今  就是如此
And right now, there's not.

566
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:08,028
FBI那边对阿尔梅达和鲍尔
What have we heard from the fbi about the search

567
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:10,028
的搜寻工作进展如何
For almeida and bauer?

568
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,058
没什么起色  总统阁下

Check with them anyway.

并无恶意  杰克

00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:25,083
没关系

575
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,034
欢迎不同意见
Disagreements are fine,

576
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:36,034

00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:39,034

Fall in or you're gone.

听不少人说过
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

579
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:43,088
很高兴你是当真的
Good to know you mean it.

580
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,066
被传讯前
Before you were subpoenaed,

581
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,032
你在外游历一年多  到处都去
You traveled the world, place to place, more than a year.

582

这是为什么

00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,083
你在找什么
What were you looking for?

584
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,010
这无关紧要
It doesn't really matter.

585
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,063
不管是什么  我都没找到
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

586
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:04,057
你肯定知道会发生什么
You must have known what was waiting.

587
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,027
那你为什么回来
Why'd you come back?

588
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:08,091
来体验下走进直升机的感觉
Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.

589
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:10,071
真有意思
That's funny.

590
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:13,011
不过  说实话
But no, really.

591
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,078
为什么
Why?

592
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:22,012
这是我的家
This is my home.

593
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:25,059
那可解释不了  你为何
That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in

594
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,036
向司法部门自首
To the justice department.

595
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:31,043
托尼说你去过贝鲁特和摩加迪沙

596
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,023

00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:35,070

00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:43,051
还计划把你见到的每个人都杀掉  对吗

601
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,074
大致如此
Pretty much.

602
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:48,038
这就是问题所在  对吗
That's the question, isn't it?

603
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:51,028
不成夫妻便成仇人是吧

想知道我为什么回来吗
You want to know why I came back?

605
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:55,025
这就是原因
That's why.

606
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,056
我没太听明白
I'm not sure I follow.

607
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,039
我已经厌倦了自言自语的日子
I just got tired of talking to myself.

608
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,076
我深信做过的每一件事都是正确的

609
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:05,026
所以我想说出来
So I wanted to start a dialogue.

610
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:07,063
坦白说  就是澄清事实
