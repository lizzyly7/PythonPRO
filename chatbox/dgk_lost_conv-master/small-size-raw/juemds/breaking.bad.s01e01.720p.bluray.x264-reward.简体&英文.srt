74
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,044
化学
Chemistry

75
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:22,058
是研究什么的
It is the study of what?

76
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,080
谁知道
Anyone?

77
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,068
本恩
Ben.

78
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,011
化学品

80
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,078
不对

81
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,068
化学
Chemistry is...

82
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,067
从学术层面说
Well technically

83
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:40,043
化学是一门研究物质的学科
Chemistry is the study of matter.

84
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:44,096
但是我更倾向于它是一门研究变化的学科
But I prefer to see it as the study of change.

85
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,032
现在  我们这样来设想一下
Now just... just think about this.

86
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:48,070

87
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,040

00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,040
改变自身的能级
Change their energy levels.

89
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,059
分子呢

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,078
分子改变自身的化学键
Molecules change their bonds.

91
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,081
这些元素
Elements.

92
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,084
进行组合从而形成化合物
They combine and change into compounds.

93
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:06,028
这就是所有生命的组成形式
Well that's... that's all of life.

94
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,057
对不对  我是说  这是个恒定的
Right? I mean it's just... it's the constant.

95
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:11,010
循环的过程
It's the cycle. It's solution

96
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,009
从生长到衰败  再到分解并溶化
Dissolution just over and over and over.

97
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:18,077
如此循环  周而复始
It is growth then decay then transformation.

98
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,039
这是如此的迷人  真的
It is fascinating really.

99
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,060

你课桌坏了吗
Is there something wrong with your table?

101
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,022
好了  离子键
Okay. Ionic bonds...

102
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,088
坐好了吗
Are you done?

103
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,085
离子键

00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,069
他说他不干了
He said he quits.

111
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,047
现在由我来管收款机
I'm gonna run the register.

112
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:38,052

Oh shit. Turn on channel 3.

161
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:26,025
到目前为止我们逮捕了3个人
At which point we apprehended three individuals

162
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,096
并已将他们拘留
And placed them into custody.

163
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,053
我很自豪地说在打击
I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of

164
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:34,020
大量的冰毒贩卖案件中
My fellow agents at the Albuquerque district office

165
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,002
阿尔布开克分局的同仁们
Resulted in a substantial amount

166
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,046
表现了杰出的敬业精神
Of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.

167
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,084
有发生交火吗
Were any shots fired?

168
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,071
没有  我们的探员给嫌疑犯来了个出其不意
No ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.

169
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,037
电视还真他妈加油添醋
Damn the TV does add ten pounds.

170
00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:47,009
加油添醋
Ten pounds?

171
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,060
你们两个  给我闭嘴坐下
Sit and spin. Both of you.

172
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,026
-汉克  -什么事
- Hank. - What?

173
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,045
不好意思  当作没看见这个
Sorry. You didn't see that.

174
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,071
太诱人了
So charming.

175
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,084
显然这是一个正在运行的组织
This is clearly an ongoing operation one

176
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:00,096
而且安排得当
Which was well organized...

177
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,018
汉克  一共多少钱
Hank, how much money is that?

178
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,073
大概有70万  很多吧
It's about 700 grand. That's a pretty good haul huh?

179
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:08,016
正如我说的  今天是阿尔布开克市民的好日子
As I say it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque

180
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:11,015
因为我们给予当地毒品交易沉重打击
When we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.

181
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:14,038
不过有点不正常  那种现金
But that's unusual, isn't it? That kind of cash?

182
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,070
和我们之前破的大部分案子不同
Well it's not the most we ever took.

183
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,004
这钱来得很快
It's easy money...

184
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,069
被我们抓到就完了
Until we catch you.

185
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:22,081
沃尔特只要你开口  我就带你去跟踪
Walt just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along.

186
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:25,044
你可以亲眼目睹我们如何捣毁冰毒实验室
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.

187
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:27,060
给你的生活增加点激情
Get a little excitement in your life.

188
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,072
是啊  有一天
Yeah, someday.

189
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:40,093
又是什么呀
Which one's this?

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,021
就是我在超级交换网上买的
Um, that faux-lalique vase

191
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,012
人造水晶花瓶
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

192
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,091
怎么样
How's it doing?

193
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,065
我已经预定了
Well, I met my reserve

194
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,047
还有两分钟开拍
and there's still two minutes.

195
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,058
什么事
What's up?

196
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:07,003
你说呢  小寿星
You tell me, birthday boy.

197
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,007
那你  周六有什么安排
Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?

198
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,069
洗车
Mm. Car wash.

199
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,049
博格丹说需要我
Bogdan says he needs me.

200
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,036
几点结束  中午  一点钟
Till what time? Noon, 1 -ish?

201
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,041
大概两点吧  差不多
Probably 2, more like it.

202
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,061
那之后呢
And then what after that?

203
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:28,040
其实呢
Um, actually,

204
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,021
我打算开车去洛斯阿拉莫斯
I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos.

205
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,028
那有一个...  游客中心举办展览
They've got this... The visitor center has an exhibit on

206
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,087
应该会很...
that's really supposed to be...

207
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,024
你不粉刷吗
You're not gonna paint?

208
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,005
刷  我会刷的
No, I'll paint.

209
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,092
只是这个...
It's just that this...

210
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:46,087
展出的是火星探测器的照片
You know, this exhibition on the Mars-rover photographs are...

211
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,071
我是说  细节一定相当清晰
I mean, the detail really is just supposed to be amazing.

212
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,088
我真的需要你能把漆刷完
It's just that I really need you to paint at some point.

213
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:57,012
-卧室早一天准备好...  -我知道
- The sooner that back bedroom gets finished... - I know.

214
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:58,075
我可以自己刷的
And I'd do it myself,

215
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:01,060
只是你说不愿意让我上梯子 
except you said you don't want me standing on the stepladder.

216
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,068
-我会刷的  -好
- I will paint. -Okay.

217
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,061
这是怎么回事
What is going on down there?

218
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,015
没事...
No, it's...

219
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,079
他睡着了吗
Is he asleep?

220
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,035
不是...  没问题  他只是...
No, it's... No, it's nothing. He's just...

221
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,034
我说  你该小心点孩子  还有...
You know. Well, you gotta be careful about the baby and...

222
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,055
不用担心孩子
Well, don't worry about the baby.

223
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,090
这是专门为你的
This is just for you.

224
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:25,086
我们今天只弄你
We are just doing you tonight.

225
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,092
所以呢  你就闭上眼睛
So just close your eyes,

226
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,023
放松  顺其自然...

227
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,045
-闭上眼睛  -哦  好

好了
Okay.

229
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,002
就这样
There you go.

230
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,047
对了
That's it.

231
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,034
就这样
There you go.

232
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,067
继续
Keep it going.

233
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,079
继续
Keep it going.

234
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:57,094
继续
Keep it going.

235
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:01,007
继...  太好了
Keep... Yes!

236
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,049
五十六耶
Fifty-six. Oh.

237
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,040
这真是太尴尬了
This is so embarrassing.

238
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,022
老实说  我没事
I am fine, honestly.

239
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,017
不过是轻微传染
It's just some bug going around.

240
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:03,046
先是我妻子  我儿子  现在我又染上了
First, my wife had it, then my son, and now me.

241
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:06,049
只是...  有一点胸痛
It's just... It's just like a chest cold.

242
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,017
可能还有点低血糖
Could be some low blood sugar as well.

243
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:11,004
我今天早饭吃得不是特别好
I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning. Honestly, I didn't.

244
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,084
听我说  能帮个忙吗  可不可以
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just, uh,

245
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:17,097
拐弯的时候让我下车
drop me off at a corner somewhere?

246
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:21,012
抱歉  不行
Uh, no, sorry.

247
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,039
我的保险真的不爽特别好
It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.

248
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,021
请你深呼吸几下
Take a couple of deep breaths for me.

249
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,007
要我们帮你联系什么人吗
Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?

250
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,046
不  天哪  不用
Ha. No. God, no.

251
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:39,026
请你坐起来一下
Lean forward for me, would you?

252
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,067
怀特先生  你吸烟吗
Mr. White, are you a smoker?

253
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,095
不吸  从不
No, never.

254
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,031
为什么问这个
Why do you ask?

255
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:31,018
怀特先生
Mr. White.

256
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,015
怀特先生
Mr. white?

257
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:36,089
你说
Yes.

258
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:40,076
我刚说的你都明白了吗
You understood what I've just said to you?

259
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,004
肺癌  而且不能动手术
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

260
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,077
不好意思
I'm sorry...

261
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:52,010
我需要确保你真的明白了
I just need to make sure you fully understand.

262
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,019
最佳治疗方案是化疗
Best-case scenario with chemo.

263
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:57,092
这样我或许还能多活几年
I'll live maybe another couple years.

264
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,059
只是
It's just...

265
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:05,062
你的衣领上有芥末
You've got mustard on your...

266
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:09,039
就那儿  沾着芥末
Right there. Mustard there.

267
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,079
就那儿
Right there.

268
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:23,006
我的记录显示已经付过了
So my records show that I paid it

269
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,085
而且我确定我们最近没有欠款
and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...

270
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,093
好  好吧
Yeah, all right. Um...

271
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,068
我会跟银行确认
Well I'll check with the bank

272
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,051
还有邮局
And maybe the post office

273
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,031
看看他们是否有弄丢
If they lost it or something.

274
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,041
好的  我再确认一下
Yeah, let me look into that.

275
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,057
好的
Okay.

276
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:38,017
谢谢
Thank you.

277
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,059
上个月你用万事达卡了吗
Did you use the mastercard last month?

278
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,060
在斯特普尔斯公司[办公用品连锁]花了15块88
15.88 at Staples?

279
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:01,048
要买些打印纸
We needed printer paper.

280
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:04,098
沃尔特  我们不用万事达卡的
Walt, the mastercard's the one we don't use.

281
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,022
好吧
Okay.

282
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,032
今天过怎么样
So how was your day?

283
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:17,068
不知道  我想
I don't know. It was um...

284
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,028
还不错
Fine.

285
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:55,041
沃尔特  我缺人手
Walt, come on. I'm shorthanded.

286
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,041
你帮忙去擦车  快点

287
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,049
-什么  -我叫你到外面去擦车
- What?  - I said I need you outside to do some wipe-downs.

288
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:02,079
你是来工作还是来发呆的
Are you here to work or to be staring at the skies?

289
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,006
快点走吧
Come on let's go.

290
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,050
快点伙计
Come on man.

291
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,037
博格丹  去你妈的
Fuck you Bogdan.

292
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,025
我说去你妈的
I said fuck you!

293
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,022
还有你那眉毛
And your eyebrows!

294
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,077
用这个擦吧
Wipe down this!

295
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:22,053
汉克
Uh Hank.

296
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,058
汉克  是我  沃尔特
Hank, it's Walt. Hey.

297
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,010
听着  没吵醒你吧
Oh listen... I didn't wake you did I?

298
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,098
好的
Oh good good.

299
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,068
不  不  没什么事  只是
No no nothing's wrong. I just uh...

300
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,093
我一直在考虑那个提议
I've been uh thinking about that offer...

301
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:39,030
跟你们一起行动
That ride-along.

302
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,007
右侧最后一幢房子  看到了吗
It's the last house on the right. See it?

303
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:45,004
不是二层的  旁边那幢
Not the two-story one, the one next to it.

304
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:48,040
有点儿那个  什么颜色来着
Kind of, uh, I don't know what do you call that? Um,

305
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,030
-绿色  -鼠尾草色
- green? - Sage.

306
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,047
"鼠尾草色"  
"Sage?"

307
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:55,007
你他妈是陶器场出来的吗
 Do you work at the fucking Pottery Barn? Jesus.

308
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,021
人家就叫鼠尾草色
Sage. That's the word for it.

309
00:22:57,077 --> 00:23:00,041
你个傻缺就认得"绿"  这也怪我
My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is "green"?

310
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,008
我还认得"贱货"  这词怎么样
"Cheese-dick." I know that one. How about that?

311
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:07,028
总之  就是鼠尾草色那幢  看到了吧
Anyway, it's the, um, sage one. See it?

312
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,056
你们怎么知道那是个制毒窝点
So what tells you it's a meth lab?

313
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:12,045
据可靠线人报告
Star snitch says some dude

314
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:16,000
一个名叫"库克船长"的家伙在里面制毒呢
Goes by cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there.

315
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,011
还总往里面掺胡椒粉
Says he always adds a dash of chili powder.

316
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,067
这群精力旺盛的老墨
Ah you exuberant mexicans.

317
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,044
"库克船长"是个白人名字
Captain Cook that's a white boy's name.

318
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,089
"呆瓜"也是
Dopey as hell too.

319
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,068
是吗  这么着
Yeah? Tell you what.

320
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,056
我赌20块猜他是个老墨
I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.

321
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:33,037
-好的  -说定了
- All right.  - You're on.

322
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:37,036
快点  快点
All right come on come on.

323
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,097
好了  校车安全经过  开始行动

看我们怎么收拾他们
Watch this.  Makes them shit.

326
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:02,043
上上上
Go go go.

327
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,069
制毒窝点在天气好时尤其危险
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.

328
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:16,063
一旦混合错误就会产生芥子气
You mix that wrong you got mustard gas.

329
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:17,075
应该是磷化氢
Phosphine gas.

330
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,034
我觉得是
I think.

331
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,046
当然没错
Yeah exactly.

332
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:24,045
吸一口就会丧命  所以要戴面罩
One whiff will kill you. That's why the respirators.

333
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:15,015
房子搜查完毕  拘捕一名嫌犯
House is clear. One suspect in custody.

334
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,002
收到
Copy that.

335
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:19,079
嫌犯会是拉美裔的吗
The suspect might he be of the latino persuasion?

336
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:22,078
驾照上的名字是埃米利奥·小山
Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.

337
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,027
亚裔的
Asian!

338
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:25,053
给钱吧  蠢货
Pay up sucker.

339
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:27,047
名字是埃米利奥
First name Emilio.

340
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,036
说明至少有一半墨西哥血统
That's at least half a beaner.

341
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,062
这么着吧  算你10块好了
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.

342
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:36,034
打起精神吧  傻瓜  你们不是还有詹妮弗·洛佩兹嘛
Cheer up gomey. You people still got J.lo.

343
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,020
汉克  我能进去看看吗
Hank, do you think I might get to go inside?

344
00:25:40,063 --> 00:25:42,006
看看制毒窝点
See the actual lab?

345
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,046
可以  跟你说吧
Yeah. Yeah I tell you what

346
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,063
我们要先进去
We're gonna go peek our heads in

347
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,018
仔细检查下
Check it out first.

348
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,038
你稍等一下
Stay here a minute.

349
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,044
天哪
Oh my god.

350
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,070
平克曼
Pinkman?

351
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:54,024
船长

352
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:36,060
是我
It's me.

353
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:38,001
就我一个
I'm alone.

354
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,096
你是怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

355
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,058
你还在我们的资料库里面
You're still in our filing system.

356
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,059
这地方是你阿姨的吗
So your aunt owns this place right?

357
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,060
是我的
I own it.

358
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,076
没人在找你
No one's looking for you.

359
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,017
你来这干什么
Why are you here?

360
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:05,077
我很好奇
I was curious.

361
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:09,027
事实上我没期待你有什么作为
Honestly I never expected you to amount too much

362
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:11,015
但是甲基安非他明
 but methamphetamine?

363
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,034
我万万没有想到
I didn't picture that.

364
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,087
这个能赚很多钱吧
There's a lot of money in it huh?

365
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,010
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

366
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:22,079
-真的  -一点不明白
- No?  - Not a clue.

367
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,090
库克船长
Captain Cook?

368
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,040
不是你吗
That's not you?

369
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:36,093
我说了  没人在找你
Like I said no one is looking for you.

370
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:38,089
听着  我不知道你来这儿干嘛
Look I don't know what you think doing here.

371
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,009
怀特老师
Mr. White

372
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,052
如果你想拿上帝那套狗屎说辞
I mean if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder

373
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:47,047
劝我去自首的话
About getting right with jesus by turning myself in...

374
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:50,020
-我不会的  -高中已经是很久远的事情了
- Not really.  - High school was a long time ago.

375
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:53,014
你又不是什么灵魂工程师  赶紧滚吧
You ain't welcome back kotter,so step off.

376
00:28:53,026 --> 00:28:54,060
少说废话
No speeches.

377
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,028
就说几句
Short speech.

378
00:28:57,023 --> 00:29:00,002
你今天被抓的的那个同伙叫什么
You lost your partner today. What's his name?

379
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:02,056
埃米利奥
Emilio?

380
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,007
埃米利奥就要去蹲大狱了
Emilio is going to prison.

381
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:10,076
毒品缉查局抄了你的窝还有钱
The DEA took all your money your lab.

382
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,035
你一无所有了
You got nothing.

383
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:15,086
话说回来
Square 1.

384
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,005
你懂得怎么贩毒
But you know the business.

385
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,003
而我掌握着化学技术
And I know the chemistry.

386
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,016
我在想
I'm thinking...

387
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:30,017
或许我们可以合作
Maybe you and I could partner up.

388
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,005
你想制造冰毒吗
You want to cook crystal meth?

389
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:47,042
就凭你
You?

390
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:50,047
你和我
You and uh... and me?

391
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:52,090
没错
That's right.

392
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,013
要么答应我
Either that...

393
00:29:58,017 --> 00:29:59,068
要么我告发你
Or I turn you in.

394
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:12,052
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell is this?

395
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,077
我怎么知道
Damned if I know.

396
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:16,045
我在描述里写的是马赛克手工艺品
I described it as mosaic folk art.

397
00:30:16,045 --> 00:30:17,054
这东西居然有人买
And somebody bought it?

398
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:18,081
是啊  明尼阿波利斯有个人
Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

399
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,040
14美元  不算邮费
Fourteen dollars plus shipping.

400
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,028
真棒
Yes.

401
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:24,072
照这样下去  再过五六十年你就发了
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years you'll be rich.

402
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,028
小说写得怎么样
So how goes the novel?

403
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,073
不是小说  其实我...
It's not a novel, actually, which l...

404
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,095
你没在写小说
You're not writing a novel?

405
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,052
你跟我说你在写小说
You told me you were.

406
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:33,095
不  是短篇故事
No. Short stories.

407
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:37,092
我说的是  如果好故事足够多
I said that if eventually I have enough good ones, that maybe I'll try

408
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:41,015
我或许会试着出版短篇小说集
and publish another collection.

409
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:42,087
小说集不好卖的
Those really didn't sell.

410
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,008
我只是觉得小说会好卖一些
I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.

411
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,084
对  可能吧
Yeah, well, maybe so.

412
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:54,045
如果你需要我读  我可以提些批评意见
Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.

413
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:57,089
哦  不用
Oh. No.

414
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:03,019
我是说  我现在还没到...
I mean, I'm just not at that stage where I...

415
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,043
不用了
No.

416
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,016
提议随时有效
Open offer.

417
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,054
沃尔特最近怎么样
So, what's up with Walt lately?

418
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,073
你指什么  他挺好
What do you mean? He's fine.

419
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:15,038
他看起来有点
He just seems,

420
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,006
我也说不清  他比平时话少
I don't know. Quieter than usual.

421
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:19,006
人到半百是件大事
Well, turning 50 is a big deal.

422
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:22,060
比如说  我对40岁可一点都不期待
I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40.

423
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:26,097
眼看自己就要不中用了
You're gonna be a complete basket-case.

424
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,067
这么说他遇到中年危机了
So it's a mid-life crisis.

425
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,024
没有  他只是不爱说话
No. He's just quiet.

426
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,024
性生活怎么样
How's the sex?

427
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:38,096
玛丽  我的老天
Marie, Jesus.

428
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:41,034
看来有答案了
I guess that answers that.

429
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,029
你就坐着不动
You just gonna sit there?

430
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,025
这个  看看这个
This. Look at this.

431
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,023
凯氏烧瓶
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask

432
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:40,055
800毫升容量  非常少见
800 milliliters, very rare.

433
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,050
我还带来了常用的试验装置
You got your usual paraphernalia

434
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,079
格里芬烧杯  锥形烧瓶
Griffin beakers your erlenmeyer flask.

435
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,027
但还有更牛掰的东西
But the PA resisted staff.

436
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,091
圆底烧瓶  5000毫升的
A round bottom boiling flask. 5,000 milliliters.

437
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:57,010
我都是用那种的
Well, I cook in one of those.

438
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,061
大个儿的
The big one.

439
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,073
这种样子的吗
One of these?

440
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:03,028
不行  这是个量瓶
No,this is a volumetric flask.

441
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,055
你不可能用这种玩意制毒的
You wouldn't cook in on of these.

442
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,061
我确实是
Yeah I do.

443
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,059
不  你不可能的
No, you don't.

444
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:12,028
量瓶只能用于普通混合或者滴定
A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration.

445
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:15,038
不可以用来加热
You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask.

446
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,059
烧瓶才可以加热
That's what a boiling flask is for.

447
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,035
我的化学课你一点都没学到吗
Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?

448
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,030
是的  你挂我科了
No. You flunked me.

449
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:24,048
-记得吗  -难怪呢
- Remember? - No wonder.

450
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:25,039
蠢货
Prick.

451
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:29,038
告诉你吧  这可不是化学课
Now let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry

452
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,004
这是艺术
This is art.

453
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,056
制毒是艺术
Cooking is art.

454
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,092
我制的毒很赞  少对我说教
And the shit I cook is the bomb so don't be telling me.

455
00:33:36,092 --> 00:33:38,099
你制的那是垃圾
The shit you cook is shit.

456
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,061
我见过你的装备  太荒谬了
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

457
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,010
我和你不是去制造垃圾
You and I will not make garbage.

458
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:46,037
我们要制出稳定的化学纯产品
We will produce a chemically pure

459
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:48,070
就像广告宣传的一般
And stable product that performs as advertised.

460
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,012
不掺假  不掺奶粉  也不掺胡椒粉
No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.

461
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,085
不  不  胡椒粉是我的标识
No no chili p is my signature.

462
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:54,093
不再是了
Not anymore.

463
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,053
好  那咱们走着瞧吧
Yeah well we'll see about that.

464
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,004
-这他妈什么玩意儿  -实验室防护用具
- What the hell is this?  - Lab safety equipment.

465

不然我们租间那种个人储藏室
