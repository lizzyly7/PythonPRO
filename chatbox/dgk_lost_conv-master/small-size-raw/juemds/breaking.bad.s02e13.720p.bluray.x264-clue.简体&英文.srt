你先得跟他们谈

警察可能会来  也可能不来

52
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,097
取决于他们今天上午繁忙的程度

一般来说  吸食过量死亡不算高优先级案子

没有可以指控你的地方

告诉他们你要见你的律师

60
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,023
其他还用我挑明吗
And do I need to state the obvious?

61
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,079
我没来过这儿
I was not here.

62
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,090
去换件长袖衬衫

00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,095
不  他是个蠢猪  操蛋的怂货
No. He was a dipshit, wannabe banger.

159
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,027
除了17岁的时候偷盗哥伦布骑士会会长
Now, no arrests, save for stealing a Baby Jesus

160
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:59,047
的圣婴像被捕  没有其他犯罪记录
From a Knights of Columbus manger back when he was 17.

161
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,045
这伙计忒不起眼
This dude was so low-rep,

162
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:03,078
从来没在我们的雷达上出现过
He never showed up on our radar.

163
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:05,069
然而我为什么要提他呢
So why am I talking about him?

164
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,064
谁知道
Anyone?

165
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,002
谁知道
Anyone?

166
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,052
布勒
Bueller?

167
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:13,039
-他贩的是"蓝天"  -对了
- He was dealing Blue Sky. - That's right.

168
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,025
我们见过的最纯  制作最专业
How is it that the purest, most professional grade

169
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,099
的冰毒怎么会
Of meth we've ever come across

170
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,093
被这种货色搞去贩卖呢
Is being slung by the likes of that?

171
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,066
别着急  还有更精彩的
But wait. It gets better.

172
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,015
这个偷圣婴像的小贼中弹挂掉之后
Since Baby Jesus thief there slowed a bullet with his neck,

173
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,027
蓝冰毒就从镇上消失了  对吧
The blue stuff's vanished from town, okay?

174
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,053
整个阿尔布开克一点儿也找不到了  为什么
Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

175
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,053
因为你那个海森堡或许已经落网了
Because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.

176
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,097
警局说  他们认为已经抓到该抓的人了
So says APD. They think they got their man.

177
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,082
我知道你不信  可或许就是真的呢
I know you don't buy it, but maybe it's true.

178
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,099
詹姆斯·爱德华杀了凯利  没错
James Edward killed Kelly, yeah.

179
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:48,052
警局认为他就是本案主谋了
APD thinks this is our mastermind.

180
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,030
这话都信  你可就傻透了
You believe that, I got a bridge to sell you, okay?

181
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,081
-他都招了不是吗  -要不是有额外的收入
- He copped to it, didn't he? - For an extra pudding cup

182
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,035
他会乐意每晚都呆在监狱
Every night at Los Lunas?

183
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,041
你要是给他一包烟
Maybe if you give him a pack of cigarettes,

184
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:00,043
他兴许连吉米·霍夫尔都招得出来
He'll tell you what he did with Jimmy Hoffa.

185
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,070
我左思右想
I've been thinking.

186
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,074
这么高级的货
Top-shelf product like this,

187
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,096
是不会凭空消失的
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

188
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,042
照我看  真正的毒枭一定会在什么地方露头
The way I see it, raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere.

189
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,046
就像游戏打鼹鼠那样  所以我就到处打电话
It's like Whack-A-Mole. So I've been making phone calls.

190
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,043
地区警署  小镇警官
Local police departments, small-town sheriffs.

191
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,025
新墨西哥州界内没什么发现
Haven't had much luck inside the land of enchantment.

192
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,013
但是在州外  我搞到了蓝冰毒的消息
But outside, I've got reports of the blue stuff

193
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:25,034
德克萨斯  亚利桑那  科罗拉多  内华达都有
Making a scene here in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.

194
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,053
事实上  到处都有
In fact, everywhere

195
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:29,007
除了这里
But here.

196
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,086
就像是某人学聪明了
Almost as if somebody wised up,

197
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,019
不在自己家门口犯事了
Stopped shiting where they eat.

198
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,063
所以说
Now,

199
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,021
我认为海森堡依然逍遥法外
I say Heisenberg's still out there.

200
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,030
我认为他向区域化发展了
I say he's gone regional.

201
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,034
但他仍然在镇上
Only he's still right here in town.

202
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,067
加油啊  两千八
Come on, 2,800.

203
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:52,027
加油  两千八
Come on, big 28.

204
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,081
你能行的
You can do it.

205
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:55,099
只差30美元了  再来30
Only 30 more dollars. 30 more.

206
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,098
40美元  两千八百一  太棒了
$40! 2,810! Yes!

207
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,085
-下一个是谁  -你的人找到他了
- Who's going to be next? - Your guy found him?

208
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,054
他在哪儿
Where is he?

209
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,050
好了  听着
Okay, listen.

210
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,005
我不在乎
I don't care.

211
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,068
你让你的人接他
You have your guy, pick...

212
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,077
闭嘴
Just shut...

213
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,095
索尔  闭嘴  把地址给我
Saul, shut up and give me the address.

214
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,012
我不建议你这么做
I don't recommend it.

215
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,079
警察在这儿有暗哨
APD's been known to sit on this place,

216
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,037
盯着出入的人
Keep an eye on the comings and goings.

217
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,050
他们现在在哪儿
Are they here now?

218
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:36,059
我没发现迹象
Well, I don't see any sign,

219
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,039
可这才是问题
But that's the point.

220
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,090
警察还不是最大的麻烦
Police could be the least of it.

221
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:43,097
你可能被抢劫或者枪击
You could just get mugged or shot.

222
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,065
你回家去如何  沃尔特
How about you go on home, Walter?

223
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,016
这事我来应付
Let me handle this.

224
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:30,094
看着我  孩子  醒醒
Look at me, son. Wake up.

225
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:36,092
我没东西给你  伙计  什么都没了
I ain't got nothing for you, man. It's all gone.

226
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,068
醒醒
Wake up.

227
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:42,055
是我  我是沃尔特
It's me. It's Walt.

228
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:47,071
我们从这出去
Let's get out of here.

229
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,030
-没事  我很好  -现在  带我出去
- No, I'm good. - Help me out, now.

230
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,048
听我说
Listen.

231
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,092
你不能待在这儿
You are not good right here.

232
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,007
绝对不能待在这儿  听到了吗
You are not good at all. You hear?

233
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,033
抱住我
Put your arms around me.

234
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:08,007
你得站起来
You're going to stand up,

235
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:10,052
我们走出去  好吗
And we're going to walk out of here, okay?

236
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:13,011
我们带你到安全的好地方去  就这样
We're going to take you someplace nice and safe. That's it.

237
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:15,043
我们走  起来  就这样
Now let's go. Come on. Here we go.

238
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,019
我杀了她
I killed her.

239
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,014
什么
What?

240
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,050
我杀了她  是我
I killed her. It was me.

241
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:51,097
我杀了她  我杀了她
I killed her, man. I killed her.

242
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,030
看着我
Look at me.

243
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:55,091
你没杀人
You didn't kill anybody.

244
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,081
我爱她
I loved her.

245
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:05,007
我爱她胜过一切
I loved her more than anything.

246
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:11,039
说实话  我没想过仪式程序的事
I haven't given much thought to the programs, to be honest.

247
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,017
我想应该是
I guess they should be,

248
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:16,018
我不确定  你
I don't know. Just...

249
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,096
你看着办吧
Use your best judgment.

250
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,048
没有黄裙子
There's no yellow dress here.

251
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:23,094
都是蓝的灰的
It's all black and gray.

252
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,065
你上次看见她穿黄裙子是什么时候
When's the last time you saw her ever wearing a yellow dress?

253
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,069
蓝的怎么样
What about blue?

254
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,094
蓝的总比黑的好吧
Blue's better than black, right?

255
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,076
不是深蓝  更像是
Not dark blue. More like...

256
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:42,054
也不是
Not...

257
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:45,039
很浅
Super-bright, either.

258
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,038
我的意思是  蓝的就是蓝的
I mean, blue is blue.

259

我知道你什么感觉  我也累
I know what you feel like. I'm tired, too.

265
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,094
好了
There we go.

266
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:37,080
你把那东西关小点儿好吗
Would you mind turning that thing down or off?

00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:43,019
叮叮响的那个
The dinging.

268
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:44,077
音量关小点儿
Just turn down the volume.

269

爸  这可是钱
Dad, it's money.

270
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:51,023
关吧  噪音吵到
Please do it. The noise is disturbing...

271
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,068
宝宝了
The baby.

272
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,086
玛丽  慢点儿说  我跟不上
Marie, slow down. I can't...

273
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:01,024
我的上帝  你在开玩笑
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

274
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,078
当然  当然可以  哪天放学后都可以
Sure. Of course. Any day after school.

好的
Ok.

277
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,016

278

And I thought I would give them a tour.

307
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,090
当然  看看自己花钱养的是什么  
Absolutely. Get to see what you're supporting.

308
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,080
我们非常感谢你们
We thank you gentlemen.

309
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,045
能跟我们谈谈你的工作吗
Can you tell us a little about your work here?

310
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:43,026
好的
Oh,yes.

311
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:44,095
阿尔布开克办公室负责
The Albuquerque office covers everything

312
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,037
从涉毒洗钱到受控物质
From drug-related money laundering to interdiction of illicit

313
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:49,020
非法越境的所有案子
Controlled substances crossing the border.

314
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:53,097
我指导的队主要调查冰毒
Now, the group that I supervise focuses on methamphetamine,

315
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:56,050
非常不幸  冰毒问题在美国日趋严重
Which is a growing problem in the country, unfortunately.

316
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,026
太可怕的
Terrible.

317
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,017
确实如此  目前我们在本地取得了一些进展
It is indeed. Now, we've had some successes locally,

318
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,070
但整体上贩毒量在增加
But overall the supply seems to be growing.

319
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,033
然而我要说  社区宣传  
But I got to tell you, community outreach,

320
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,039
比如你们正在进行的投资调查
Like this fun run,

321
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,057
是我们最有力的武器之一
One of the most powerful weapons we have.

322
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,017
我们可以做什么
Anything we can do.

323
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:14,004
先生们
Gentlemen.

324
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,073
这位是你们的探员吗
Is this one of your agents?

325
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,064
他是我连襟
That's my brother-in-law.

326
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,012
他患病了  我们正在
He's got a health issue. We're trying to...

327
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,060
我很遗憾
I'm very sorry.

328
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,036
什么病
What sort of health issue?

329
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,071
肺癌
Lung cancer.

330
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,084
很难治的
That's a rough one.

331
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,070
你不必这样的
You don't have to do that.

332
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,044
我很高兴能尽力
I'm happy to do it.

333
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,073
-非常感谢  -不客气
- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.

334
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,090
我来告诉你  我有一阵子不会来了
Just so you know, I won't be back for a while.

335
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,076
我周五去动手术
I'm going to have my surgery on Friday.

336
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,068
希望一切顺利
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

337
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,017
但如果不幸
But if not,

338
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:20,037
索尔会照顾你  你的钱在他那儿
Saul will take care of things. He's got your money.

339
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,019
他替你存着呢
He's keeping it for you.

340
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:38,079
执著不放无济于事  相信我
Lingering on things doesn't help, believe me.

341
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,032
努努力  专心好起来  好吗
Just try and focus on getting better, okay?

342
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:45,018
我罪有应得
I deserve this.

343
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,066
什么
What?

344
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,011
你在沙漠里说的话
What you said in the desert.

345
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,042
我明白了
I get it...

346
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,058
明白你什么意思了
What you meant.

347
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,025
一切都是我罪有应得
I deserve whatever happens.

348
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,061
该死
Shit!

349
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:42,055
他来了
There he is!

350
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,060
我们在给小沃尔特做专访
We're doing a feature on Walter Junior.

351
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:50,003
我们给你打了差不多50个电话
We called you about 50 times.

352
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:53,052
我以为是报纸专访呢
I thought we were just talking about a newspaper story.

353
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,084
我知道  可是我想
I know. But I thought,

354
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:59,018
既然能上报纸  干嘛不上电视呢
If it's good enough for the Journal, then why not TV?

355
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,082
所以我就去了
So I went for it.

356
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,049
这就是他
This is him?

357
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,004
这位是爸爸
This is Dad. Great.

358
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,018
大家去沙发上坐  
Let's get everyone on the couch.

359
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,068
小沃尔特坐中间
I'm thinking Walt Junior in the middle,

360
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:10,066
爸爸妈妈坐两边
Mom and Dad on either side.

361
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,089
爸爸妈妈
Mom and Dad?

362
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,072
到目前为止你募捐了多少钱
How much money have you raised so far?

363
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,010
六千三百六十美元
$6,360.

364
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,088
更多的捐款一直源源不断
But there's more coming in all the time.

365
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:27,046
-真不错  -我们不知道该说什么
- That's amazing. - We don't even know what to say.

366
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,087
太难以置信了
It's been incredible.

367
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,046
从你和其他人
Judging from the things you and other folks

368
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:33,014
写的材料上看
Have written about him,

369
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,022
你爸爸一定是个了不起的人
Your dad must be quite a guy.

370
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,046
他是的  他是最棒的
He is. He's the best.

371
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:41,085
你不想失去他  是吗  沃尔特
You don't want to lose him, do you, Walter?

372
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:43,043
我们都不想
None of us do.

373
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:44,091
我们爱他
We love him.

374
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:48,001
他是个好人  对吧
He's a good man, isn't he?

375
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,040
当然了  你可以问任何人
Absolutely. Ask anyone.

376
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,044
任何人  他是个好爸爸  好老师
Anybody. He's a great father, a great teacher.

377
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,023
他知道所有关于化学的事情
He knows, like, everything there is to know about chemistry.

378
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:01,081
他很耐心  永远帮助你
He's patient with you, and he's always there for you.

379
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:03,018
他
He's just...

380
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:06,001
高尚
Decent,

381
00:32:06,097 --> 00:32:09,096
行事永远正直
And he always does the right thing,

382
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,013
他也是这样教导我的
That's how he teaches me to be.

383
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,021
他是你的偶像吗
Would you say he's your hero?

384
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,057
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:20,070
我父亲是我的偶像
Totally. My dad is my hero.

386
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,055
这会让他睡着吗
Does that put him to sleep?

387
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:34,063
这只会让他放松一些
This one just relaxes him a little.

388
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,092
我们快准备好了  
We're almost ready.

00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:38,030
马上送你进去
We'll be taking you in in just a minute.

390
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:47,027
要开始了
Here we are.

391
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,097
放松了吗
Relaxed yet?

392
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,019
事实上
As a matter of fact...

393
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,036
我不知道这是什么东西
I don't know what this stuff is,

394
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:22,087
但它确实不错
But it's pretty great.

395
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,025
是啊  看起来是
Yeah, it looks like it.

396
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,024
你醒来的时候我们会在这的
We'll be here when you wake up.

397
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,006
我会看到你的
I'll be looking for you.

398
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,069
他们应该想让我帮你摘了眼睛
They'll probably want me to take your glasses.

399
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:38,087
对极了
You better.

400
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,014
你的手机呢
Where's your phone?

401
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:50,005
手机  带来了吗
Your cellphone. Did you bring it?

402
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:51,025
哪一个
Which one?

403
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:59,078
我确定他没带  妈妈
I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom.

404
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:23,066
先说重要的
First things first.

405
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,090
宝宝多大了  
How old is the baby now?

406
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,032
我们什么时候能看她
And when do I finally get to meet her?

407
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:29,039
我本来想今天带她来的  但是
I was actually thinking of bringing her today, but...

408
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,037
她明天就满7周了
She's seven weeks tomorrow.

409
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,096
七周  对吧
Seven, right?

410
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:34,085
我这有
I have a...

411
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:37,009
她照片
A picture,

412
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,098
就在这
Here somewhere.

413
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,031
她真漂亮
She's beautiful.

414
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:46,051
说这话总是松口气  她也真的漂亮
Always a relief to say that and actually mean it.

415
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,068
疼痛程度如何  沃尔特
How's your pain level, Walter?

416
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,075
很低  基本上是
Very low, basically.

417
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,032
呼吸急促呢
Shortness of breath?

418
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,091
有一点儿  不过好多了
A bit, but much better.

419
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,004
很好
Good.

420
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:01,047
你的化验结果看起来不错
Your margins look good.

421
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,051
显然  我不能预见未来
Obviously, I can't foresee the future,

422
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:06,040
但即使保守地讲  我也可以说
But even conservatively speaking, I can say that

423
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:09,007
你确实给自己赢得了一定时间
You bought yourself some real time here.

424
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,059
我们有理由乐观
There's no reason not to be optimistic.

425
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:12,087
太好了
That's great.

426
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:15,036
太好了
That is great.

427
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,062
他什么时候可以正常生活
So, when could he get back to his normal routine?

428
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,087
他现在就可以逐步适应了
He can ease into it now.

429
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,029
他能继续工作或者
And can he go back to work or...

430
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,020
这需要再等几周
I'd give it a few more weeks.

431
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:33,062
不要搬重物  
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting

432
00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:34,078
多休息
And continue to get plenty of rest.

433
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,035
他可以独立生活了
But he can be on his own?

434
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:40,090
就是  无需依赖他人
Just more, independent.

435
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:45,002
你们自己看着办
Use your best judgment.

436
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:48,059
这对你是好消息
That's good news for you, honey?

437
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:50,098
少了个要照看的孩子
One less baby in the house.

438
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,054

你知道  我们一直挂念你

445
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,059
-你还好吧  -我还好
- You've been doing okay? - I'm doing okay.

446
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:30,043
到了一定时候
After a certain point,

447
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:32,018
休假也不管用了
Time off doesn't help,

448
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:35,053
所以我想我还是在这更好
So I figured I'd rather be here,

449
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,017
专心工作
Focus on work.

450
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,014

458
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:22,076

Doesn't look so bad, right?

00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:37,031
-什么时候定的  -我带宝宝走
- Since when? - I'm taking the baby with me.

463
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:39,076
玛丽会去学校接小沃尔特
Marie will pick up Walter Junior from school.

464
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:42,078
这两天房子是你一个人的
You'll have the house to yourself for two days.

465
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,094
我要你收拾东西搬出去
I want you to pack your things and leave.

466
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,094
为什么
Why would I do that?

467
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:49,070
汉克会来帮忙  
Hank has offered to help,

468
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,017
因为你不能搬重物
Since you shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.

469
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:55,010
我要你星期一早上之前离开  我
I want you gone by Monday morning. I want...

470
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,016
我要你走
I want you gone.

471
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:09,096
能不能至少告诉我为什么
Can you at least tell me why?

472
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:14,013
因为你是个骗子  沃尔特
Because you're a liar, Walt.

473
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,013
还是有两部手机
Two cell phones, after all.

474
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:22,037
你手术之前  
Right before your surgery,

475
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,086
我问你带没带手机
I asked if you had packed your cell phone,

476
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,014
你回答说
And you said,

477
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:27,015
"哪一个"
"Which one?"

478
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,018
什么时候
When?

479
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,065
我用了药
I was medicated.

480
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,094
我说地球是平的也说不定呢
I could have said the world was flat.

481
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,067
知道我怎么看吗
You know what I think?

482
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,034
我看你是不小心说了真话
I think you accidentally told the truth.

483
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,069
亲爱的  这事我们谈过了
Honey, we have been over this.

484
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,026
你问过我  我也回答了
Asked and answered, right?

485
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,026
之后我又一次开始思考
Then it got me thinking

486
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:53,013
思考你异常的举动
Again about all the strange behavior,

487
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,041
尤其是你的失踪
Not the least of which was the disappearance.

488
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:59,040
我担心的发疯  给医院打电话
Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals,

489
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,046
查住院资料
Checking the morgue.

490
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,083
你的心理状态
Your fugue state.

491
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,031
那个我不得不信  不是吗
I had to believe that, didn't I?

492
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:11,077
我得找个解释
I had to find a way.

493
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:14,062
我是说
I mean...

494
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:18,018
这事上为什么要撒谎
Who would lie about such a thing?

495
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:20,024
告诉我
You tell me.

496
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:23,055
告诉我你到底以为我隐瞒了什么事
You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about.

497
00:40:24,017 --> 00:40:26,094
什么事  外遇  我有外遇吗
What? An affair?I'm having an affair.

498
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:27,079
你是这么想的吗
Is that what you think?

499
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,056
那就是我想的 对
That what I am thiking.Yes.

500
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,051
-最近几周  -跟谁
- For the last few weeks. - With whom?

501
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,087
我跟谁有外遇
Who am I having an affair with?

502
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,025
我猜是格雷琴·施瓦兹
My guess was Gretchen Schwartz.

503
00:40:36,027 --> 00:40:38,052
你们之间一定有事
Something was going on between you.

504
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,009
我就是知道
I just knew.

505
00:40:40,026 --> 00:40:41,017
上帝
Jesus.

506
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,069
给我本圣经让我发誓  只要这能证明我清白
Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes.

507
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:45,058
我没跟格雷琴搞一起
I am not having an affair with Gretchen.

508
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,073
我知道  我知道你没有
I know. I know you're not.

509
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:49,039
因为我问过她了
Because I asked her.

510
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,009
为了跟她联系上我可是大费周章
It really took me forever to get in touch with her.

511
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,046
她几周都不接我电话
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

512
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,060
所以最后我就留言给她
So I finally left a message...

513
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:02,097
你跟我丈夫之间到底怎么回事
"What exactly is going on between you and my husband?"

514
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:05,099
我想这会引起她注意  如我所料
I thought that would get her attention, and it did.

515
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:09,080
她给我回了电话  而且最后她告诉了我
So she called me back, and she finally told me.

516
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:13,095
你治病的钱
The money for your treatment,

517
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:18,085
格雷琴和埃利奥特一分钱都没给你
Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime.

518
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:22,018
他们没出钱
They paid for nothing.

519
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:25,029
你拒绝了他们所有的帮助  
You refused every offer they made you.

520
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:26,060
可是这不对劲
But that didn't make sense

521
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,095
因为我问过医院的戴尔克沃利
Because I checked with Delcavoli at the hospital, and...

522
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:32,007
不包括手术费
Not including your surgery,

523
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,044
我们差不多付了
We're nearly paid up.

524
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:37,009
10万美元
Over $100,000.

525
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,052
哪儿来的钱
Out of where?

526
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,099
天上掉下来的
Out of thin air?

527
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:53,011
可是之后
But then...

528
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:57,006
我又打电话给你母亲
I called your mother.

529
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,005
这也多谢你了
Thanks for that, too.

530
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:08,010
我当时想  或许她有笔钱我不知道呢
But I thought, maybe she has some money that I don't

531
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:10,076
或许她慷慨解囊
Know about. Maybe she contributed.

532
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,020
也是有可能的
It's possible.

533
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:20,094
结果不但钱不是你母亲给的  我还发现
It turns out that not only is the money not from your mother,

534
00:42:21,076 --> 00:42:25,076
她甚至不知道你得了癌症
She didn't even know that you have cancer.

535
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,080
你根本没去看她
You never went to see her.

536
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:36,001
我送你去机场  又接你回来
I dropped you at the airport. I picked you up.

537
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,067
你走了4天
You were gone for four days, and...

538
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,076
可她却发誓说
Yet she swears...

539
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:43,094
你从没去过她那
That you were never there.

540
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:52,078
谎言谎言谎言还是谎言
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

541
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:58,069
你能不能
Could you...

542
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:01,042
就一次
Just once...

543
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,055
尊重我
Do me the courtesy

544
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:08,032
别否认了
Of not denying it?

545
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:23,068
别这样  求你
Don't do this, please.

546
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:27,083
求你别走
Please don't go.

547
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,009
如果我说实话
If I tell you the truth,

548
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,040
你能留下来吗
Will you stay?

549
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:46,054
留下来  我全都告诉你
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

550
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:49,079
不管你要说什么
Whatever it is...

551
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,079
我太害怕  不想知道
I'm afraid to know.
