00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,012
我们来分析一下
Let's break it down.

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,090
氢元素  人体中含有多少
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:55,031
用摩尔数值表示吗  有63%
By mole? We're looking at 63%.

12
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:56,035
63吗
63?

13
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:58,067
占得很多啊
That is a big bite.

14
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,026
下一个是  氧元素
My next step's gotta be oxygen.

15
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,058
26%
26%.

16
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,057
26  以上两种元素组成了水
26. There you have your water.

17
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:07,091
-碳  9%  -碳  9
- Carbon. 9%.  - Carbon. 9.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,042
-总共是98%  -没错
- For a total of 98%?  - Right.

19
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,060
-氮  1.25%  -1.25
-Nitrogen 1.25%.  - 1.25.

20
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:17,077
这样总共99.25
That brings it to 99 and a quarter.

21
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:21,005
剩下就该是微量元素了
Which only leaves you with the trace elements

22
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,084
接下来我们要见证神奇啦
down with the maggic happens.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,063
等一下  钙有多少
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?

24
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,090
钙可不是微量元素啊
Calcium's not a trace.

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,089
骨头里可都是钙啊
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,066
-你是这样想的  对吧  -没错
- You would think, right?  - Right.

27
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,010
钙  钙元素只有0.25%
Calcium. Calcium is only 0.25%.

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,008
什么  这么少
What? That low?

29
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,033
真的吗
Seriously?

30
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,062
天哪  没想到只有这么少
Damn, I never would have thought that.

31
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:46,031
好的  铁有多少呢
Okay, so where does Iron fit in?

32
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,012
铁  没错
Iron. Wow, okay.

33
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:54,064
0.00004%
0.00004%.

34
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,078
什么
What?

35
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:58,045
没有铁  可没法合成血红蛋白
You can't have hemoglobin without Iron.

36
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,008
看来用不了多少
Apparently, it don't take much.

37
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,015
是啊  继续
No, it don't. Go figure.

38
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:05,020
-钠  -钠  0.04
- Sodium.  - Sodium? 0.04.

39
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:14,018
-磷  0.19  -0.19  这就对了
-Phosphorus? 0.19  -0.19. There we go.

40
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:18,057
这样的话  所有的元素
So, the whole thing...

41
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,096
加起来总共
Adds up to...

42
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:25,081
99.888042%
99.888042%.

43
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:32,090
还有0.111958%
We are 0.111958%...

44
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,004
少了
Shy.

45
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,052
应该已经全了才对
Supposedly that's everything.

46
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:44,052
不知道  我只是
I don't know. I just... I just...

47
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:47,016
觉得少了什么  不是吗
Just seems like something's missing, doesn't it?

48
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:52,047
人体内应该还有别的什么
There got to be more to a human being than that.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
绝

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
命

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
毒

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
师

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
第一季

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,050
第三集

55
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:25,006
我讨厌这双鞋
I hate these shoes.

56
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,006
穿着这鞋就好像是
These shoes make me look like

57
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,014
要去给人换便盆一样
I should be changing bedpans,

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,082
好像我就应该端着汤
like I should be squeaking around bringing soup

59
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,093
喂给恶心的老头子喝
to some disgusting old person,

60
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,011
然后再搭公车回去照看16只猫
then take the bus home to my 16 cats.

61
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,039
那你干嘛还穿着
Then why are you wearing them?

62
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,096
我喜欢它的足弓垫
I like their support.

63
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,014
我的足弓恰好很拱
My arches happen to be extremely archy.

64
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,041
唷  怎么啦
Yo. What's up?

65
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,031
两分钟以后打给我好吗
Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes?

66
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,040
谢了  拜拜
Thanks. Bye.

67
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,024
我去接个电话
Gotta go take this.

68
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,015
女的
Female?

69
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,094
路易斯
Louis.

70
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,037
这好像不关你的事吧
Not like it's any of your business, though.

71
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,010
快点就行
Just be quick about it.

72
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:10,066
还有  别再说"唷"了
Oh, and, um, please don't say yo.

73
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:13,036
你不知道我有多讨厌这词
You can't know how much I hate that.

74
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:22,046
你有个地方没刷到
You missed a... spot right there.

75
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,085
你确定能爬梯子吗
Should you be up on that ladder?

76
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:27,008
欢迎你上来接我的班
You know, you're more than welcome to take over for me up here.

77
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,088
我不明白  干嘛不让沃尔特来做
I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.

78
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:32,085
确实是个主意
Yeah. There's an idea.

79
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:38,041
最近我正在写短篇小说
So, I'm working on this new short story,

80
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,092
想塑造一个吸毒的人物
and there's this stoner character in it.

81
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,026
我想要
I'm trying to, um...

82
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,067
事实上  我是想问你
Well, you know, actually, let me back up.

83
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,071
你在大学里
You've smoked your

84
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,074
抽过大麻  对吗
fair share of pot in college, didn't you?

85
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,049
我是说  你至少试过吧
I mean, you at least tried it.

86
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,020
承认吧
Come on.

87
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:07,017
我可能是试过  为什么问这个
I perhaps tried it. Why?

88
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,027
你还记得  大麻对你的情绪有影响吗
Do you remember it having an effect on your mood,

89
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:12,018
像是性情大变  或者别的
like changing it in any major way, or...

90
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,087
我觉得我变得更严肃了
It made me more serious.

91
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,004
真的吗
Really?

92
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,077
因为我只记得
Because I mostly remember

93
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,036
抽了以后会飘飘欲仙而已
it made me light-headed. That's about it.

94
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,027
我只是想知道  大麻会不会
I was just wondering if it maybe could...

95
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:33,028
我在这个人物上有点卡住了
You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.

96
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,002
别放在心上
Never mind.

97
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,066
小沃尔特吸大麻了吧
Walter Jr.'s on pot?

98
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,095
什么  不  不是
What? No! No.

99
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:41,032
你怎么会这么想
What would make you even...

100
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,024
他从哪弄来的
Where's he getting it from?

101
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,039
-玛丽  -说真的  是不是那个叫路易斯的
- Marie.  - Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

102
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:48,021
你打算怎么做
What are you going to do about this?

103
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,072
你看着我的眼睛  听我说
You need to look me in the eye.

104
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,089
我真的只是在问关于
I am strictly asking about

105
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,070
我在写的小说的事  仅此而已
a story that I am writing. That's all.

106
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:58,059
我对天发誓  小沃尔特没有吸毒
Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot.

107
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,013
至少据我所知没有
Certainly not as far as I know.

108
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,004
据你所知没有
Not as far as you know?

109
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,003
玛丽
Marie.

110
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,031
看着我
Look at me.

111
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,078
转过来看着我
Hey, turn around and look at me.

112
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,024
这  这东西
This... This here...

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,092
我对头号仇敌也不会这么干
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.

114
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,086
太耻辱了
This is degrading.

115
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:21,027
对不起
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,083
你希望我会放你一马
You hope I'll make it easy on you

117
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,067
就这么算了  是吧
and just drop them, don't you?

118
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:28,052
但我不会的
Well, I won't.

119
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,089
所以要么杀了我  要么放了我
So either kill me or let me go.

120
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,058
你不适合干这行  沃尔特
You don't have it in you, Walter.

121
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,021
你怎么知道我名字的
How do you know my name?

122
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,050
杰西
Jesse.

123
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,076
是他告诉埃米利奥和我的
He told Emilio and me.

124
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,040
他来卖你那冰毒的时候
When he came by to sell your meth?

125
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:54,015
怎么  你威胁他了
So what? You threaten him, huh?

126
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,071
-毒打他了  -根本用不着
- Did you beat it out of him?  - Not even close.

127
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,079
他还跟你说什么了
What else did he tell you?

128
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,097
所有你能想到的事
Pretty much everything you can think of.

129
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,064
你是他的高中老师
How you were his high school teacher.

130
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:11,059
讲二氧化碳的时候在课堂上
How one time you taught about carbon dioxide

131
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,080
做葡萄汽水
by making grape soda in class.

132
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,073
你有个儿子轻微智障
How you have a son who's retarded,

133
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,027
或者残疾之类的
or in a wheelchair or something.

134
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:24,020
这应该不算新鲜事吧
This shouldn't come across as some news flash.

135
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,033
你的同伙
That partner of yours...

136
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,060
嘴巴不严实
He's got a big mouth.

137
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:33,056
沃尔特  我不知道你是怎么看待自己的
Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here,

138
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:39,000
但是相信我  这行当不适合你
but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.

139
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:44,086
所以我应该放你走
So I should just let you go, then?

140
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:48,093
给你开锁  祝你一路顺风吗
Just unlock you and adios, huh?

141
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,025
我看你别无他法
I don't see what real choice you have

142
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:55,039
不然就得狠下心肠杀我
if it's between that and cold-blooded murder.

143
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,030
此外
Besides...

144
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,028
楼上那位才是大麻烦
Your real problem is sitting upstairs.

145
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,028
有人
Occupied!

146
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:25,058
我这正费劲呢
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here!

147
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,091
给点私人空间  行吗
Just give me some privacy, would ya?

148
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,017
到底干嘛
What the hell, man?

149
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,098
你干什么
What are you doing, man?

150
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,074
-混蛋  -你告诉他我名字
- You asshole!  - You told him my name.

151
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:40,098
-谁说的  他自己  -我的名字  在哪儿工作

-还跟他讲我儿子  -别碰我
- You told him about my son!  - Don't touch me!

153
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,050
-该死的混球  -不  给我
- Damn junkie!  - No, give me that!

154
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:48,058
迟了  我要把它冲到厕所里  你就看着吧
Too late! This is going down the toilet. Watch it go!

155
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,088
值4万呢  你个蠢货
No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.

156
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:53,041
你都抽光了就啥也不值
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.

157
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,082
从马桶上起来
Get off the toilet.

158
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,080
从马桶上起来
Get off the toilet!

159
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,035
停下
Stop it!

160
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,009
不  没门
No! No way!

161
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,052
你往哪儿走
What the hell do you think you're going?

162
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,035
-闪开  神哪  -我们有活要干
- Back off, man! Jesus!  - We've got work to do!

163
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:56,046
你有活要干  我的做完了
No, you got work to do. I did my part.

164
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,010
你说我花了两个小时清理的
You mean that obscenity that I spent

165
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,050
那堆恶心东西吗
the last two hour clearning up?

166
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,032
-都是拜你所赐  -滚你妈的蛋
- That is your contribution!  - Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man!

167
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,010
我也不像这么做
I didn't ask for any of this!

168
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,026
我还怎么在这住下去
How am I supposed to live here now, huh?

169
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:09,007
我的房子整个一股香港脚和干洗剂味儿
My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.

170
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,016
因为你不听我指挥
Because you didn't follow my instructions!

171
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,005
万岁  希特勒
Oh, well, heil Hitler, bitch.

172
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,060
我给你说道说道吧
And let me tell you something else.

173
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,039

00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,088
我们俩
You and me.

175
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,030
我们俩
You and me!

176
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,075
抛硬币是神圣的
Coin flip is sacred.

177
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,004

地下室里有活等着你
Your job is waiting for you in that basement,

179
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,075
是硬币决定的
as per the coin.

00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,074
快他妈的动手
Fucking do it already.

181

你好  这款有黑色吗
Excuse me. Do you have these in black?

186
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,097
总之  就像我说的
Anyway, so like I was saying,

187
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:15,062
几天前的某个晚上我去参加了派对

你去哪儿了  我两小时前就给你打电话
Hey, where have you been? I called you two hours ago.

大事  是个敏感问题
Kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject,

Marijuana.

204
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,066
-他吸大麻  -胡扯
- He's smoking it.  - Bullshit.

205
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,094
他妈妈似乎这么觉得
Excuse me. His own mother seems to think so.

206
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,080
-斯凯勒告诉你的  -她暗示我了
- Skyler told you that?  - She inferred it.

207
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,049
暗示吗
She inferred it, huh?

208
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:13,058
她强烈的暗示  就像说
She strongly inferred it, like...

209
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:18,071
"医生  我一个朋友有勃起功能障碍"
"Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction."

210
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,088
好了  你得跟他谈谈

该沃尔特跟他谈  斯凯勒更好

我觉得他爸来做更合适
I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing,

219
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:39,070
不是吗
don't you think?

220
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,093
汉克  他敬重你

我可以肯定地告诉你
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not,

256

把手拿开
And hands off the car.

304
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,019
很棒
Cool.

305
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,030
关门  关门
Shut the door. Shut the door.

306
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:40,078
锁上  锁上
Lock it. Lock it.

307
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,004
那他妈是谁
Who the hell was that?

308
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,005
一条子和某个橄榄球运动员跟我瞎扯
A cop and some football player messing with me.

309
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,025
他们问起我了吗
They ask about me? huh?

310
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:52,028
没有  我想他们是想要大麻
No. I think they just wanted pot.

311
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:10,082
见鬼  我没拿我的麦根沙士
Oh, shit. I left my root beer.

312
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,017
让他活着
Let him live.

313
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:24,035
这样做是道德的
It's the moral thing to do.

314
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,014
或许他能听进道理  创伤后应激

315
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,014
不要让你良心不安
Won't be able to live with yourself.

316
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:35,043
杀人是犯法的
Murder is wrong!

317
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:47,011
杀了他  要是放走他  他会杀你全家
Kill him. He'll kill you entire family if you let him go.

318
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,039
你好
Hello.

319
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,049
亲爱的  是我
Hey, sweetie, it's me.

320
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,057
我很抱歉
Listen, I'm so sorry.

321
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:09,053
我忘了时间
The time, it just completely got away from me there.

322
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:16,053
我的错  我的错  博格丹让我加班
My fault. My fault. Bogdan just kept me here late,

323
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,067
你知道的  盘点库存  还有
you know, doing some inventory, and...

324
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:21,020
我  我应该
I've... I should have just...

325
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,047
你说的对  我应该学会说  "不"
You know, you're right. I gotta learn to say, you know, "No"!

326
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,009
但是
But, um...

327
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,009
斯凯  在听吗
Sky? You there?

328
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:36,011
你是在洗车店吗
You're at the car wash?

329
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,024
对
Yeah.

330
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,004
我对此深表怀疑
I seriously doubt that,

331
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:44,083
因为你两星期前辞职了
Since you quit two weeks ago.

332
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,052
我打过电话给博格丹找你
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

333
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:55,099
他的话令我大吃一惊
Quite an earful he gave me.

334
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,012
听着
Listen...

335
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:05,016
听我说  我会回家去的  回家再谈
Listen, I'll come home, and we'll talk about it.

336
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,064
我不这么想  沃尔特
I don't think so, Walt.

337
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,043
亲爱的
Honey.

338
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,067
不管你在哪
Wherever you are...

339
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,072
你就在那过夜好了
Why don't you just stay there tonight?

340
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,079
斯凯勒
Skyler?

341
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:16,030
斯凯勒
Skyler?

342
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:20,021
斯凯勒
Skyler?

343
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,064
沃尔特
Walter!

344
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,056
下面的快饿死啦
Kind of hungry down here!

345
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:33,044
该死
Damn.

346
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,039
我还以为你就此长眠了呢
I didn't think you were coming back.

347
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,046
我昏过去多久
How long was I out?

348
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,024
10到15分钟的样子
10, 15 minutes.

349
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,014
我从来没见过咳嗽能把自己给摔了
I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.

350
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:02,092
你也中了和我一样的毒气吗
You breathe in the same thing you used on me?

351
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:14,055
我得了肺癌
I've got lung cancer.

352
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,004
我再给你做个三明治
I'll go make you another sandwich.

353
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,044
放心吃吧
It's safe.

354
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,033
没放毒药
There's no poison.

355
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:23,026
是吗
Yeah?

356
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,031
如果你要杀我
Because that'd be the way to do it...

357
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:30,032
这可是好机会
if you're gonna do it.

358
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,013
我觉得也是
I suppose it would.

359
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:38,008
我是说  你毕竟是个化学家
I mean, you being a chemist and all.

360
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,055
那么
So...

361
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,071
那个名字
That name...

362
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,035
疯狂小八
Krazy-8...

363
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:05,031
我一定要这么称呼你吗
Do I really have to call you that?

364
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,041
我无意冒犯  不过
I mean, no offense, but...

365
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,053
你有真名吗
Don't you have a real name?

366
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:11,092
多明戈
Domingo.

367
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:15,012
多明戈
Domingo.

368
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:18,051
是星期天的意思  对吗
That's "Sunday", right?

369
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,017
如果你不介意的话  我就这么叫你
I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.

370
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,087
可以  随便你
Yeah, whatever.

371
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:30,005
我自己也说不上喜欢这名字
I can't say I ever liked it much.

372
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,088
那么  多明戈
So, Domingo...

373
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:40,074
你是本地人  还是外地来的
Are you from around town here or someplace else?

374
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:44,028
沃尔特  你多了解我点
Walter, you getting to know me

375
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,034
并不意味着对我下手就容易些
is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.

376
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,016
你要知道  我可不怕
Not that I mind, you understand.

377
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,076
你一直跟我说
You know, you keep telling me

378
00:27:53,094 --> 00:27:56,072
我不适合这工作  或许吧
that I don't have it in me. Well, maybe.

379
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,090
也可能不对
But maybe not.

380
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:05,045
我一直在找不杀你的理由
I sure as hell I'm looking for any reason not to.

381
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:07,092
哪怕一点也行
I mean, any good reason at all.

382
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:16,014
忽悠我吧
Sell me.

383
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:18,071
回答我刚才那个问题
Tell me what it is.

384
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:24,081
我想应该先向你保证
I guess I'd start off by promising that,

385
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:26,013
如果你放我走  我不会来追杀你
if you let me go, I won't come after you.

386
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,085
你会平安没事
That you'd be safe.

387
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:31,095
我想说我们之间发生的一切
I guess I'd say what happened between us...

388
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,063
就当从没发生过
never happened.

389
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:37,008
我们把这事忘得一干二净  对大家都有好处
And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.

390
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,053
但你觉得谁会在这种情况下
But you know that anybody in my situation

391
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:41,029
做这样的承诺
Would make promise like that?

392
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,097
就算有
And though in my case they happen to be true,

393
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:46,038
你也不能确信真假
you'd never know for sure.

394
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:52,016
我还能跟你说什么呢
So what else can I tell you?

395
00:28:58,007 --> 00:28:59,051
我不知道
I don't know.

396
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:03,038
但是你得说服我
But you gotta convince me.

397
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:07,061
不然的话你哪都别想去
And you're going nowhere until you do.

398
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:11,004
别  别  别
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

399
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:14,008
我是本地人
I'm from here in town, man.

400
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:18,009
阿尔布开克人  土生土长的本地人
ABQ. Born and bred.

401
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,017
从没出去过
Never left.

402
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:23,001
在新墨西哥州立大学攻读工商管理
Studied business administration over at UNM,

403
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,053
并获得学位
got my degree.

404
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,055
真的吗
Really?

405
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:33,071
那个在毒品交易时能派上用场吗
Does that come in handy in the drug trade?

406
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:35,066
根本没用
It doesn't hurt.

407
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,038
本来我想学音乐的
I was gonna study music originally.

408
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,089
还想考奥柏林或伯克利音乐学院的
Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee.

409
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:46,066
我爸爸劝我放弃
My pops talked me out of it.

410
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,042
他说除非我跟某些狗屁摇滚歌星混
Said there was no money in it unless

411
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,031
不然的话  赚不了钱
I wind up some bullshit rock star.

412
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,002
而我压根就没有任何机会
And I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man.

413
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:56,054
你爸爸是干什么的
What does your dad do?

414
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:00,050
他在梅诺尔有家坦皮科家具店
He owns Tampico furniture over on Menaul.

415
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:04,053
等等  我知道那地方
Wait a minute. I know that place.

416
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:09,002
等等
Wait a minute. That's...

417
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,013
就是那个
That's that...

418
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:15,020
他们以前在深夜
They used to have those late-night...

419
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,040
-放那些无聊广告  -没错  -就是他
- Those stupid commercials. - Yeah. - That's him.

420
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:21,096
-他开了30多年  -等等
- He's been doing them for over 30 years.  - Wait a minute.

421
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:24,003
那个怎么唱来着  是不是
How did it go? It was, uh...

422
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:26,069
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

423
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:31,089
别让购物伤透脑筋
Don't let shopping strain your brain-o.

424
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:36,099
来唱唱这首小曲
Just sing this short refrain-o.

425
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,097
我们的家具都很棒
Our furniture is bueno.

426
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:44,004
店名叫做坦皮科
Tampico is the name-o.

427
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,074
好傻的歌
Pretty moronic.

428
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:57,082
不过你能怎么办
But what can you do?

429
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,090
印象太深刻了
It did tend to stick in your head.

430
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:05,089
家族里的音乐家  是你写的吗
Did you write that, being the musician of the family?

431
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,094
当然不是
Hell, no, man.

432
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,024
是我的疯子叔叔埃里克斯写的
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

433
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:12,079
他在酒吧里唱  用来泡妞的
He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.

434
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:15,041
他认为  这首歌好像在说
In his mind, it's like saying,

435
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,031
我写下了通往天堂的阶梯
"I wrote stairway to heaven."

436
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,036
等等  坦皮科家具
Wait a minute. Tampico furniture.

437
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,040
我记得我儿子出生时
I think when my son was born that

438
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,064
在那买的摇篮车
we bought his bassinet there.

439
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:29,084
我们不卖摇篮车的
We don't sell bassinets there.

440
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:31,048
有更特别的
It's more special deal.

441
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,055
我们的确卖过婴儿床
We did use to sell cribs.

442
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:38,035
婴儿床  可能吧  婴儿车
Oh. Well, a crib, then, okay? Crib.

443
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,015
对  没的  我记起来了
Yeah. No, I remember that.

444
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:41,037
其实
In fact,

445
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:45,083
我记得那些广告里那个是你爸爸
I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials.

446
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,002
虽然他在真实生活里
Although he wasn't...

447
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,085
一点也不友好
anywhere near as friendly in real life.

448
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:52,022
对  一点都没错
Yeah, no shit.

449
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,038
他是不是想给你提供延长保修啊
Did he try selling you that extended warranty?

450
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,079
好像是的
Yeah, he probably did.

451
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:59,099
而且我也傻兮兮的买了
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.

452
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,004
他就看中那个
Yeah, that was his big thing.

453
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,016
你向他要一杯水
You ask him for a glass of water,

454
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,033
他就跟你说  要冰块就得延长保修期
he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.

455
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:13,085
-你也在那里工作吗  -一直在
- So did you work there, too?  - Only my whole life,

456
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:17,012
直到我跟他说"操你妈"  然后不干了
up until the day I said "fuck you" and quit.

457
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:22,021
那么
So, uh...

458

16年前你多大
16 years ago, how old would you have been?

459
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,042
放学后  相信我  我就在那儿
It was after school. Trust me, I was there.

460
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,089
可能还给你打过电话
Might have even helped ring you up.

461
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:37,013
你和延长保修期证都婴儿车里
You and your extended warranty on the crib.

462
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:47,087
世界真小啊
Small world.

463
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,028
是啊
That it is.

464
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:55,029
这就是我们走过的路
The paths we take, huh?

465
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:07,026
要吗
You'd like...

466
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,037
你...
You...

467
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,020
杰西知道你得了癌症吗
Jesse know you got cancer?

468
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:28,011
除了你没人知道
No one but you.

469
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,031
家人也不知道吗
Not your family?

470
00:33:32,055 --> 00:33:33,049
不知道
No.

471
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,091
为什么不说
Why not?

472
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,031
不知道怎么开口
Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.

473
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,039
所以你才做冰毒吗
That's why you're cooking meth?

474
00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:52,071
想给家人留下笔钱
You want to leave money for your family.

475
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:59,028
要是你现在放了我  我就给你写张支票
Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.

476
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,071
就像我说的  沃尔特
Like I said, Walter,

477
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:10,092
这行当根本不适合你
this line of work doesn't suit you.

478
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,040
事情无法挽回之前尽早抽身
Get out before it's too late.

479
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:26,039
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

480
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,009
你心里知道的
Yeah. you do.

481
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:58,098
我去拿钥匙
I'll get the key.

482
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:03,057
别这样  别这样
No, don't do this. Don't do this.

483
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,076
你何必如此
Why are you doing this?

484
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,052
何必如此
why are you doing this?

485
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:43,086
你的决定是对的  沃尔特
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

486
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,008
你能不能...
Do you mind to...

487
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:11,036
那你没生气吧
So... you're not angry?

488
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:14,008
你什么意思
How do you mean?

489
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,004
生气
Angry?

490
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:18,029
没有
No.

491
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,001
宽以待人  伙计
Live and let live, man.

492
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,097
那是可以理解的
That's very understanding.

493
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:26,096
随便吧
Whatever, man.

494

我只想回家
I just want to go home.

495
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:36,084
我也是
Me, too.

496
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,079
把我解开  沃尔特
Unlock me, Walter.

497
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,051
那瞬间我...
The moment I do...

498
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:09,078
你想用那个破盘子戳死我吗
Are you gonna stick me with that broken piece of plate?

499
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,007
抱歉  抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

500
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,087
对不起  对不起  非常抱歉

对不起
I'm sorry.

502
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,077
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

503
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:28,041
有人吗
Hello?

504
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,058
下面有人吗
Anybody down here?

505
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,085
各位
Everybody!

506
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:45,000
大家都坐在自己的位置上

Settle down, please. Thank you.

508

And we are going to be watching

512
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:06,042
准备看一段很有意思有关碳的影片

513
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:08,079
非常重要的元素

514

-你们怎么想  -这个是制毒点  肯定是
- So what do you think?  - It's a cook site. Gotta be.

515
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:18,049
没人会碰巧经过这鬼地方的
Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.

516
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:21,081
火灾可能是由于事故引起的
Fire there could have started by accident.

517
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:24,094
看起来不像是故意毁灭证据
Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence.

518
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,060
有好几条双轨道通向那条路
Got a couple of dually tracks headed away towards the road.

519
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,093
怎么  难道他们是在露天实验
So, what, they're in some kind of camper slash lab.

520
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,047
他们不小心放了火  然后就消失了
They accidentally start a fire, and everybody f.o.'s?

521
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:37,011
怎么不能啊
Yeah, why not?

522
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:40,094
为什么那个头发跟胶一样的家伙留下车呢
Except why would that little hair-gelled shit leave his car?

523
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,076
哎呀呀  格米
I-yi-yi, Gomie!

524
00:43:45,061 --> 00:43:47,022
素质都大不如前了
It's a culture in decline.

525
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,081
又丰富又充满活力的修养
It's a rich and vibrant culture.

526
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,021
车上下颠簸
It's a car that jumps up and down.

527
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:53,021
怎么了
What the hell?

528
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,037
你们习惯做征服者了  老天爷
You people used to be conquistadors, for christ's sake.

529
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:59,086
闻着像达卡黑工厂
Smells like a drakkar noir factory in here.

530
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,066
我已经检查过了
I already searched it.

531
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:07,051
你只是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

532
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,001
别找了
Give it up.

533
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:11,070
这要是辆迷惑人的车辆
If this here's a trap car,

534
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:14,098
你这么干  什么也找不出
it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.

535
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:18,049
我可是寻密老手  伙计
You are talking to the trap car master, my friend.

536
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:21,041
我是数牙签的雨人
I'm rain man counting his toothpicks.

537
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,045
对  你跟雨人一样
Yeah, you're like rain man.

538
00:44:23,054 --> 00:44:24,087
是弱智
Retarded.

539
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:34,010
好了  宝贝儿
Yeah, baby.

540
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,034
-看看  能人儿  -混蛋
- Hello, zippy.  - Asshole!

541
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:43,009
看起来像是冰毒  但是
I'd say that looks like meth, but it's...

542
00:44:43,028 --> 00:44:44,096
这颜色也太他妈的白了
It's too damn white.

543
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:49,060
知道我在想什么吗  格米
You know what I'm thinking, Gomie.

544
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:52,009
有人灭了我们的线人
Somebody croaked our snitch.

545
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,062
探员
Hey, agents!

546
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,035
有什么发现吗
You got something?

547
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,055
我也不知道  只是
I don't know. Just...

548
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,091
难道看起来不像
Just doesn't it seem like...

549
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,097
缺了什么吗
Something's missing?

550
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:41,006
灵魂呢
What about the soul?

551
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:54,035
灵魂
The soul.

552
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:05,010
除了化学再无它物
There's nothing but chemistry here.

553
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:11,040
斯凯勒
Skyler.

554
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,038
我有事要告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.
