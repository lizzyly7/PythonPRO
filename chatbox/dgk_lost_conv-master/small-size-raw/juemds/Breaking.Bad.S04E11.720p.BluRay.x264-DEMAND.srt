他怎么办
What about him?

11
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,500

这人需要帮助
This man needs help!

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,370
可付我薪水的是他
This man pays my salary.

16
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,710
第四季 第十一集
S04E11: Crawl Space

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,080
40.23磅
40.23 pounds.

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,670
他们回来了吗
Are they back yet?

19
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,380
你有消息吗
Have you heard from anyone?

20
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,959
如果平克曼死了  我就不干了
If Pinkman is gone, I'm done.

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,390
听明白了吗  我辞职
Do you understand? I quit.

22
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,380
我刚跟你说过了  40.3磅
I just told you. 40.3 pounds.

23
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,220
40.21磅
40.21.

24
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,909
我连襟
Look, uh, my brother-in-law--

25
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,700
他一直在说要开去工厂化农场看看
he keeps talking about driving out to the factory farm,

26
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,840
我已经
and I have--

27
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,510
尽可能地拖住他了
I have stalled him as long as I possibly can,

28
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,350
但拖到现在
but it's really at the point now

29
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,790
他很可能会找别人带他去的
where he's just gonna find someone else to take him out there.

30
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,050
我不知道那里是否收拾妥当
So I-I don't know if it's been made presentable yet,

31
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,820
但应该由我带他去  对吧
but I should be the one to take him out there, right?

32
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,560
那你能不能帮我通传一声
Can you just run it up the chain of command, then?

33
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,010
有什么可疑的吗
Anything suspicious?

34
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,230
还是没有  沃特
Still no, Walt.

35
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,460
那我们该走了吗
Well, then, should we go?

36
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,690
你有地方要去吗  因为你好像
You got someplace to be? 'Cause that's, like,

37
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,960
问过我三遍了
the third time you've asked me that.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
没有  我只是很好奇
No. I'm just curious

39
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,300
下一步怎么办
what the next move is.

40
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,300
我们下三步都是静观其变
Our next three moves is sitting here and waiting.

41
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,840
这工作就是这样  兄弟
This here's the job, buddy.

42
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,770
你知道的
You know,

43
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,340
不像人家有游艇超模什么的
supermodels and speedboats, you know?

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,790
有什么贩毒集团的消息吗
Any, uh, cartel news these days?

45
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,790
我总是在报纸上
Seems like I'm always

46
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,890
读到一些零碎的
reading something or other in the paper.

47
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,810
是啊  发生在国内的不太多
Yeah, well, not a lot happening Stateside.

48
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,700
我听说南部发生了一些摩擦  大动干戈
I'm hearing rumblings about some big play down south.

49
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,670
显然死了很多人
Lots of bodies, apparently,

50
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,540
就算是对于贩毒集团而言
even by cartel standards.

51
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,240
等事情浮出水面  我们会有更多消息
We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.

52
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,820
我们什么时候该聊聊你的脸色
So when are we gonna talk about your face?

53
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,120
我可不想聊这个  行吗
I don't wanna get into it, okay?

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,620
不  这可不行
No, it's not okay.

55
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,769
我连襟一副不屑一顾的态度
My brother-in-law shows up looking like Macho Camacho,

56
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,810
他不觉得我们该讨论一下吗
and he thinks we're not gonna discuss it?

57
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,130
兄弟  如果你有什么烦心事
You know, buddy, if you're in over your head on something,

58
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,100
你不觉得理应找我倾诉吗
don't you think I might be the guy to come to?

59
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,920
我海军航空基地有位老友
You know, one of my old buddies from Glynco--

60
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,240
他嗜好赌博
he had a gambling problem,

61
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,250
但他爱玩刮刮卡
but his thing was scratch cards

62
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,820
而不是二十一点
instead of blackjack.

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,500
那愚蠢的混蛋
Dumb Okie bastard.

64
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,190
抵押了自己的汽车去玩连刮卡
Had his car repo'd playing scratch-n-wins.

65
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,830
他现在没事了  他得到了帮助
He's fine now, you know. He got help and all.

66
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,750
但是我知道他戒掉赌瘾的路很是艰难
But I know he got on a ride that was rough to get off of.

67
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,880
我只是说  如果你想聊聊
I'm just saying I'm here, you know,

68
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,390
我随时恭候
if you want to talk about it.

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,120
我不想跟你或任何人
I don't want to talk about it

70
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,010
聊什么事
to you or to anyone else.

71
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,130
我不想再为自己辩解了
I'm done explaining myself.

72
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,020
喂  叫你呢
Hey, uh-- Yo.

73
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,950
他还需要继续输血吗
You think he needs some more blood?

74
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,710
血在冰箱里
It's in the refrigerator.

75
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,950
你让我自己去...
What, you-- you want me to, uh...

76
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,710
A型阴性  对吧
A-negative, yes?

77
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,860
你的血型
Your blood type?

78
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,330
我不知道  也许吧
Um, I don't know. Maybe.

你吸烟  喝酒
You smoke, you drink,

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,980
啧啧啧
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,770
不过没有疾病  没有不良反应
But no disease, no condition,

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,870
除了有一种过敏症
no complication other than an allergy to...

88
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,330
等等  你别说出来
Wait. Don't say.

89
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,680
红霉素过敏
Erythromycin.

90
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,380
但我这儿有头孢唑啉  所以没关系
But I have cefazolin in here, so no problem.

91
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,440
你怎么知道这些的
How do you know all that?

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,760
天啊
Jesus.

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540

该走了
It's time to go.

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,370
麦克怎么办
What about Mike?

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,310

107
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,440
赶紧的
Vámonos.

108
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,520
那飞机怎么了
What happened to the plane?

109
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,740
去南部有很多条路可以走
There are many good ways south.

110
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,590
不幸的是  去北部只有一条路
Unfortunately, only one way north.

111
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,470
距德克萨斯州6英里
Six miles to Texas.

112
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,650
那边有人接应
I've got a man there

113
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,120
开车载我们走完剩下的路
who will drive us the rest of the way.

114
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,500
我还是喜欢飞机
I kind of liked the plane.

115
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,570
你还挺得住吗
You gonna make it?

116
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,430
6英里很远的
Six miles is pretty far.

117
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,260
我挺得住
I'll make it.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,320
你在那边表现很好
You did well down here.

119
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,010
而且你证明了另一件事
And you also proved a point.

120
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,950
我想你现在一个人能撑得起实验室
I think you can run the lab by yourself now.

121
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,750
不是吗
Don't you?

122
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,670
放过怀特老师
Let Mr. White go.

123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,400
结账还是赶人  随你
Pay him off or fire him.

124
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,790
不要杀他
Don't kill him.

125
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,890
你知道那是不可能的
You know that won't work.

126
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,260
那你可有麻烦了
Then you've got a problem.

127
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,010
我们回来了
Hi. We're home!

128
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,380
在写作业吗
You doing your homework?

129
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,270
在写
Yeah.

130
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,110
30分钟后开饭
Well, dinner is in about 30.

131
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,020
抱歉打到你家里
Hey. Sorry to call you at home,

132
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,120
我想你可能没收到我的信息
but I think maybe you're not getting my messages.

133
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,780
或者是不想跟我讲话
That, or you just don't feel like talking to me.

134
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,400
不管怎么说  我打电话是为了
Anyway, why I've been calling

135
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,530
我们之前谈的那件事
is because that thing we discussed?

136
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,070
我考虑过了
Well, I've been thinking, and, uh,

137
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,300
我决定我不能那样做
I decided I can't do it.

138
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,209
我知道你一定不想听到这样的消息
I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear,

139
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,740
但是希望你能够理解
but hopefully you'll understand,

140
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,810
如果你想再谈这件事
and if you wanted to talk some more about it,

141
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,310
也没关系
that's fine.

142
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,780
给我回电话  我都在
So call me. I'm all around.

143
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,500
请进
Come on in.

144
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,570
首先  你要知道我明白你的处境
First, I want to tell you that I get it.

145
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,580
从你讲的情况来看
From what you've told me,

146
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,780
沃尔特赌钱的状况
this situation with Walt's gambling

147
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,150
好像很严峻
sounds...intense.

148
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,580
没错  事态严峻
Yeah, it definitely was

149
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,509
而且越发棘手
and continues to be.

150
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,360
所以
So

151
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,559
如果你乐意帮忙
I would greatly appreciate it

152
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,910
我将非常感激
if you would just help me out here.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,260
我已经考虑了很久
Well, I have thought long and hard about this,

154
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
现在
and, uh...

155
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,990
我想要这样做
here's what I want to do.

156
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,710
沃尔特没事吧
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?

157
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,120
你跟他有联系吗
Are you in contact with him?

158
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,300
他很好
Um, he's fine.

159
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,610
好  那就好
Good. That's good.

160
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,590
他还不知道你给我...
He doesn't know about you offering, uh...

161
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,000
对  完全不知道
No, absolutely not,

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,170
而且我也不打算让他知道
and I mean to keep it that way, so...

163
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,210
61万7千美元
$617,000

164
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,710
抬头写的我
written out to me.

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,009
什么意思
Uh, what is this?

166
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,610
我不能要你的钱
I can't take your money.

167
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,720
为什么
Oh? And why is that?

168
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,780
因为毕竟
Because at the end of the day,

169
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,030
用赌博赢来的钱去还债...
paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings...

170
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,920
我也说不好  就是感觉不太对
I don't know. It feels wrong.

171
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,960
感觉不太对
It feels wrong?

172
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,990
-我是这样感觉的   -嗯
-To me, it does.   -Uh-huh.

173
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,260
我不是对你和沃尔特有成见
I'm not judging you or Walt.

174
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,310
只是我心里不太舒服
I'm just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

175
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,670
泰德
Well, um, Ted,

176
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,670
我们之所以陷入今天的困境
the whole reason we're in this mess

177
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,310
都是因为你让我帮你做假账
is because you had me cooking your books.

178
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,440
你这个始作俑者
So when did wrong

179
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,340
几时学会"不作恶"了
suddenly become a problem for you?

180
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,210
打住  当时不过是一时情急
Now, hold on. That was a one-time measure.

181
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,020
我当时是一心为了保护我的员工
I took an honest attempt to protect my employees

182
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,440
挽救我父亲的公司
and save my dad's company.

183
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,170
那或许是个错误
And it might've been a mistake,

184
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,109
可也不说明我现在应该错上加错
but that's no reason to go out and make another.

185
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,610
不  泰德  眼前这才是大错特错
No, Ted. This is the big mistake right here.

186
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,730
你欠联邦政府61万7千美金
You owe the federal government $617,000.

187
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,000
你不还钱  他们不会放过你
If you do not pay them, they will come after you,

188
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,430
然后会追查到我
and then they will come after me.

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,510
如果他们来审查我的生意
And if they audit my business,

190
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,710
就会发现我和沃尔特买下洗车场
find out that Walt and I paid for it

191
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,810
花的将近一百万美元
with close to a million dollars

192
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,740
都是未上税的赌博收入
in untaxed gambling winnings,

193
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,380
我们也会进监狱
we will go to prison,

194
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,250
去陪你
where you will already be.

195
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,750
你明白了没有
Do you understand?

196
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,409
我明白你很担忧
I understand you're upset,

197
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,009
可是你也说得太严重了
but I think you're overstating things, too.

198
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,310
没人会进监狱的
No one's going to prison.

199
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,210
我的上帝  你怎么就听不懂呢
Oh, my God. How are you not following me here?

200
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,430
好吧  好吧
Okay. Fine.

201
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,390
就假设我听了你的
Let's say I take your advice.

202
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,230
交上国税局的罚金  又能怎样
I pay the IRS. Then what?

203
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,610
你就不欠税了
Then you don't owe them.

204
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,710
对  可是我还欠银行钱呀  斯凯勒
Okay. But I still owe the bank, Skyler.

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,970
我还是要破产
I'm still gonna go bankrupt.

206
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,110
失去产业和家园
I'll lose my business and my home.

207
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,540
女儿们也不得不退学
I still have to pull my girls out of school.

208
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,659
交上那愚蠢的罚金
Just because I pay some stupid fine

209
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,210
丝毫不能改变我的生活已经被毁掉的事实
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

210
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,720
如果我没理解错的话
So, if I'm understanding you correctly,

211
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,590
你的意思是  你不能接受我给你的钱
you're saying you can't take the money I gave you,

212
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,070
但是可以接受一笔更多的钱
but you can take a larger amount.

213
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,570
不
No.

214
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,100
我只是说
I'm just saying,

215
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,510
尽管我非常感激
as much as I appreciate the gesture,

216
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,600
可是你给我的钱改变不了任何事情
the money you gave me doesn't really change anything.

217
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,510
-因为钱不够多吗  -不是  不是
- Because it's not enough? - No. No.

218
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,070
别误解我的意思
Don't twist my words.

219
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,010
不是钱多钱少的问题
This isn't about amounts.

220
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,480
而是我有我的坚持
This is about me doing the right thing.

221
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,580
泰德  你是在敲诈我吗
Ted, are you blackmailing me? What?

222
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,910
没有  没有敲诈
No. Blackmailing?

223
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,410
天呐
God.

224
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,709
我想我可能是没有说明白
I feel like I'm not explaining things right.

225
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,810
我看你已经说得很明白了
I think you're explaining it fine.

226
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,870
我注意到
I notice that, uh,

227
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,609
这上面的
this is for...

228
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,610
数额好像比我给你的少
less than what I gave you, by the way.

229
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,909
那是我租的奔驰
That's the Mercedes.

230
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,809
在我知道这钱从哪来之前租的
I leased it before I knew where the money came from.

231
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,209
现在你知道  你肯定要把车给还了
Mmm. And now that you know, you will, of course, be returning it?

232
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,109
租约蛮苛刻的
Well, the leases are pretty ironclad,

233
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,499
我得去看看有没有可能
so I have to see what's possible.

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,270
可是我会尽我所能的
But, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

235
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,410
我会尽快还你钱的
And I will pay you back as soon as I can.

236
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,310
我不需要你还我  泰德
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.

237
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,420
我要你还给他们
I want you to pay them.

238
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,630
可是  斯凯...
But, Skyl--

239
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,130
重写一张支票
Try it again. Write a new check.

240
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,630
-斯凯勒  -同样的数额
- Skyler-- - Same amount.

241
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,530
只是这一次  把收款人
Only this time, made payable--

242
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,720
-我们这是怎么了  -把收款人
- What happened to us? - Make it payable

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,610
写成国家税收局
to the Internal Revenue Service.

244
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,410
我不能
I can't.

245
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,000
你必须得写
You have to.

246
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,500
说真的  我不能
Actually, no, I don't.

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,940
快给我写
Write it.

248
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,910
麻烦找索尔・古德曼
Saul Goodman, please.

249
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,460
告诉他事关重大
Tell him it's important.

250
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,890
是的
Yeah.

251
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,350
我做了什么
What have I done?

252
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,110
你好  赫克托
Hello, Hector.

253
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
他们都死了  赫克托
All of them, Hector.

254
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,900
伊兰迪奥先生
Don Eladio,

255
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,910
帕科先生  塞萨尔  罗纳尔多
Don Paco, Cesar, Renaldo,

256
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,660
佛托诺  思科还有路易斯
Fortuno, Cisco, and Luis,

257
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,240
埃斯卡纳拉
Escalara--

258
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,370
都死了
all dead.

259
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,280
你的孙子华金也死了
As is your grandson Joaquin.

260
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,350
你知道谁杀了华金吗
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

261
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,860
想见见吗
Would you like to see?

262
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,480
就是这个年轻人
This young man.

263
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,570
还记得他吗
Do you remember him?

264
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,540
在护送我逃跑过程中
That young man shot Joaquin to death...

265
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,370
这个年轻人开枪打死了华金
while I made my escape.

266
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,720
我记得你们之前应该见过
I believe you have met him before.

267
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,220
本来你们家族只剩下你和华金
It was just you and Joaquin.

268
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,710
你只剩下他这一个亲人
He was the only family you had left.

269
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,760
现在塞拉曼加家族
Now the Salamanca name

270
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,220
将与你一起进坟墓了
dies with you.

271
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,600
现在你能看我了吗
Will you look at me now?

272
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,320
看着我  赫克托
Look at me, Hector.

273
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,030
看着我
Look at me.

274
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,359
听着  沃尔特  我十分感谢
Hey, listen, Walt, I really appreciate

275
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,309
你又帮我一次
you doing this again, you know?

276
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,110
我知道你们最近
I know you guys must have

277
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,610
洗车房生意忙得不可开交
your hands full with the car wash and all.

278
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,460
没有  不用担心
No. No. No worries.

279
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,610
很乐意帮你
Happy to do it.

280
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,670
再说  我也有机会
Besides, it gives me a chance

281
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,740
能亲眼见证你的办案过程
to see how you work a case.

282
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,950
-还挺有趣的  -那是
- It's interesting. - Yeah.

283
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,880
就像在看毒品的生长过程
Like watching weeds grow, huh?

284
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,600
这工作无聊至极
Nah, this job's as boring as hell.

285
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,820
而且会一直这么下去
Until it's not.

286
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,950
对了
So, uh,

287
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,030
在墨西哥的那事怎么样了
any more news on that thing in Mexico?

288
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,300
还是老样子
Aah, same old, same old.

289
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,550
就是一群禽兽互相挖空对方的眼睛
Bunch of animals clawing each other's eyes out over turf.

290
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,109
你觉得所有的死者
So you think all the victims

291
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,000
都是贩毒集团的成员
were cartel members?

292
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,040
你还是知道的少点好
Not in the loop enough to know.

293
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,930
听着  能在这条街右转吗
Listen, take a right at this street here, will you?

294
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,330
右转  可我们要去养鸡场
A right? But, uh, we're going to the chicken farm.

295
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,510
那可在正前方
That's straight ahead.

296
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,320
不了  今天我们绕点路
No. Gonna take a little detour.

297
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,290
好吧
All right.

298
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,250
那里有一个
Yeah, there's this, uh,

299
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,410
洗衣厂我要去检查一下
industrial laundry I want to check out.

300
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,900
不太远
It's not far.

301
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,860
在这里右转
Just turn right here.

302
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,590
什么洗衣厂
What, uh-- What-- What laundry?

303
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,720
什么来头
What about it?

304
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,520
那是名叫麦德罗电机公司的下属企业
Well, it's owned by this company-- this Madrigal Electromotive.

305
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,040
这是个大型德国企业集团  涉猎很广
It's this big German conglomerate. Into everything.

306
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,820
可事实表明
Well, it turns out

307
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,130
那家集团也拥有福林炸鸡店
it's the same company that owns Fring's chicken joints.

308
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,820
感觉你在胡乱猜测呢
Sounds like a real shot in the dark there.

309
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,240
我是说  你自己说的
I mean, you said it yourself.

310
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,210
要是这个麦德罗  名字对吧
If this-- Madrigal, is it?

311
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,710
要是这是一家大集团  那么
If it's such a big conglomerate, then--

312
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,420
他们肯定涉及各种行业
I mean, they must own all kinds of businesses.

313
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,960
这只是
Nah, it just...

314
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,250
只是听上去理由有点单薄
It just sounds kind of...thin.

315
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,009
看看你  你剃了头发
Well, look at you. You lose your hair,

316
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,009
进行了几次侦察
you go on a couple stakeouts.

317
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,620
就认为自己是大侦探科杰克了
So now you're what, Kojak?

318
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,510
我只是说说而已
I'm just saying.

319
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,270
再说那个养鸡场
Now, the chicken farm, however--

320
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,000
那地方看上去是一个
boy, that place seems ripe

321
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,490
十分合适做地下活动的地方
for some kind of, uh, clandestine activity.

322
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,280
我只是不想错过任何线索
I just-- I just don't want us to miss anything, you know?

323
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,050
你想说地下活动
Yeah, well, you want to talk about clandestine activity?

324
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,080
麦德罗电机同时还拥有一家
Madrigal Electromotive also owns a subsidiary

325
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,310
生产最先进空气过滤系统的附属企业
that manufactures this state-of-the-art air filtration system.

326
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,080
恰恰正是盖尔・伯蒂彻
And none other than Gale Boetticher

327
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,750
订了其中一个系统
took delivery of one of these systems.

328
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,190
一个有着计划建造一个
Yeah, a chemist who was in possession

329
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,120
大型冰毒实验室的化学家
of hand-drawn plans for a meth super-lab,

330
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,560
恰恰又在被爆头的几天前
and was visited by none other that Gus Fring

331
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,760
正好被古斯・福林拜访过
just days before he was capped in the face, okay?

332
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,100
这开始有点像
Shit, this is starting to feel like a--

333
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,430
《英雄不流泪》里面的剧情了
like Three Days on the Condor, you know?

334
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,889
无论如何  一个洗衣厂正是
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place

335
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,410
隐藏冰毒实验室的好地方
to hide a-- hide a meth lab.

336
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,259
就在那里
There it is right up there.

337
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,310
这个口转弯
Just turn in there.

338
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,890
慢下来  你得转弯了  沃尔特
Well, slow down. You gotta turn there, Walt.

339
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,910
沃尔特  你在干吗  你刚开过了
Walt, what are you doing? You just missed it.

340
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,659
对不起  那里看上去像条泥路
I'm sorry. It looked like a dirt road.

341
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,450
我以为你要接着开
I thought you meant further up.

342
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,660
就这里调头吧
Just bang a U-ie over here.

343
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,350
真不赖  谢谢你们
Mmm. Hits the spot. Thanks, guys.

344
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,300
我和妈妈说要冰激淋
I said to Mom, "Ice cream,"

345
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,010
可她说这个味道差不多  还更健康
but she was like, "It tastes the same, and it's healthier."

346
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,910
不好意思  我尽力了
So, sorry. I tried.

347
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,040
冻酸奶完全一个味道啊
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.

348
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,440
吃起来没一点差别
Tastes exactly the same.

349
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,440
真替你的味蕾难过
I feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.

350
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,950
汉克姨夫  你说说看
Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.

351
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,950
又不要钱嘛  不要钱的东西都好吃
Hey, it's free food. Free food always tastes good.

352
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,790
不要钱的酒我更喜欢
Free drinks even better.

353
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,220
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

354
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,510
又来个看你的  能行吗
Can you handle another visitor?

355
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,260
脱线先生你好啊
Ho-ho! Mister Magoo.

356
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,260
<i><font color="FFFF80">[以超级近视闻名的电影人物]</i>

357
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,009
-有何指教  -小心看路
- Yeah, sure. - Hey, watch out.

358
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,909
可别撞墙上了  知道不
Don't run into any walls or anything, all right?

359
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,100
没问题
Okay.

360
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,970
老爸
Hey, Dad.

361
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,810
儿子
Hey, son.

362
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,070
戴着这个感觉如何  汉克
So how you feeling, Hank?

363
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,620
感觉就跟戴了一狗脖套似的
Kind of feels like one of those cones they put on dogs

364
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,120
就是防止狗狗舔蛋的那玩意
so they don't lick their own balls.

365
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,980
谢了  你真会说  继续
Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

366
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,379
不过你也别挂心
Anyway, hanging in there.

367
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,150
你来看我  我很高兴
Glad you stopped by.

368
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,120
我...这件事真是对不住你
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry about all this.

369
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,009
那家伙也不知哪儿蹦出来的
That guy-- he just came out of nowhere.

370
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,610
才怪  哪是蹦出来的
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

371
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,060
一英里外我就瞧见他了
I saw him coming a mile away.

372
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,620
行  全当我脑子进水了吧
Hey, just mark it down as a brain fart,

373
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,500
好在没出人命
and be thankful no one got killed.

374
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,700
我跟你说
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

375
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,800
你们的二人组任务到此为止
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

376
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,370
不许再让他带你去搞侦查
No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts.

377
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,810
太危险了  听到了吗
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

378
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,010
-那我来  -不  不行
- I'll do it. - Oh, no, you won't.

379
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,510
玛丽说的对  是我鼠目寸光
Marie's right. It was a bit shortsighted of me.

380
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,553
所以我认栽了
That's why I caved.

381
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:23,545
认什么栽
Caved?

382
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,660
我残疾了
I broke down.

383
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:27,710
我订了一辆"残的"
I ordered me a gimp-mobile.

384
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,720
能不能别用这个词
I wish you would stop calling it that.

385
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,950
什么意思  带升降机的微型车吗
What do you mean, like a handi-van with a lift?

386
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,909
不是  就是那种普通款泰虎
Nah, nah. It's a regular Tahoe.

387
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,480
带手控的
It's got hand controls.

388
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,990
我下了单  大概一个星期就能到货
I ordered it. It should be here in about a week.

389
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,360
虽然不愿意常开那玩意
I don't expect to be in it long,

390
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,250
不过总得自己出门
but I gotta get around on my own

391
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,130
别总给大家当累赘
and stop being such a damn burden to everyone.

392
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,310
失陪一下
Oh. Sorry.

393
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,850
洗车场的事
Car wash business.

394
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,080
是我  方便讲话吗
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,240
你说吧
I can listen.

396
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,490
好吧  他没有枪
Fair enough. He doesn't own a gun.

397
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,760
至少没有合法购买的枪支
At least not one that he bought legally.

398
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,430
家里的安保系统也没装
Nor does his home security system

399
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,309
那类紧急救援按钮装置
have any kind of panic button arrangement.

400
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,870
所以依我看  可以过去搞了
So, way I see it, we're good to go.

401
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,700
主要看你是不是还想这样处理
That is, if this is still how you want to handle it.

402
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,380
我说过了  不想任何人受到伤害
Like I said, I don't want anyone hurt.

403
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,380
对他唯一的要求就是开出支票
All I want is for him to write a check.

404
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,980
放心好了
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.

405
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,820
我派我最得意的手下搞定
I've got my A-team on it.

406
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,580
有什么可以效劳的吗
Can I help you?

407
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,610
有  谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

408
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,370
你们不能就这么...
You just can't...

409
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,220
究竟什么情况
What's this about?

410
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,240
贝内克先生  告诉你什么情况
I'll tell you what this is about, Mr. Beneke.

411
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,810
情况就是你得和我尽量把修尔伺候高兴了
This is about you and me doing our best to keep Huell happy.

412
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,590
修尔  谁是修尔
Huell? Who's Huell?

413
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,510
这位就是
This is Huell.

414
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,710
修尔  你高兴吗
Huell, you happy?

415
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,460
一般般
Reasonably.

416
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,810
什么惹你不高兴了
What would make you unhappy?

417
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,840
这个小王八蛋不听话
This little mofo not doing what he's told.

418
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,109
那要是你还不高兴
And if you were to become unhappy,

419
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,740
贝内克先生敢不管吗
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

420
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,430
量他也不敢
I'm gonna say no.

421
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,470
好了  现在你明白了
Well, there you have it.

422
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,250
赶紧去拿支票簿
Let's go find your checkbook.

423
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,600
行了吗  走吧  好嘞
Ready? Here we go. All right.

424
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,770
咱走着  迈开步子
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

425
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,170
就这样  很好
There you go. Very nice.

426
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,870
你这房子还不赖啊  这边
Beautiful place you have here. This way.

427
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,649
听好了  一共是617,226美元...
So, the amount's gonna be for $617,226--

428
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,609
我可没有那么多钱
I don't have anywhere near that kind of money.

429
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,690
少来这套
Hold that thought.

430
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,010
忘说了  我们知道你账户里有多少
Forgot to mention we know exactly, down to the penny,

431
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,560
一个子儿都瞒不了
how much money's in your checking account.

432
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,990
现在明白了吗
Okay? Understand?

433
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,050
还想说刚才那套鬼话吗
You still want to say that stuff from before?

434
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,620
大概不敢了吧
Maybe not. So,

435
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,710
617,226块
$617,226

436
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,620
外加3毛1分
and 31 cents,

437
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,130
开给国税局
made payable to the Internal Revenue Service.

438
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,710
什么
W-What?

439
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,880
等等  这是斯凯勒
Wait. This is, uh, Skyler's...

440
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,140
斯凯勒・怀特派你们来的
Skyler White sent you?

441
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,120
谁派我们来并不重要
Doesn't matter who sent us. For right now,

442
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
现在你唯一该操心的是手里那个
all you have to do is worry about that.

443
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,940
天呐  这可是大水冲了龙王庙了
Oh, my God. This is a giant misunderstanding.

444
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,410
斯凯勒是我非常好的朋友  知道吗
Skyler is a dear friend of mine, all right?

445
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,710
让我给她打个电话  我们就...
Let me call her. We'll, uh...

446
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,590
慢着  贝内克先生  你搞错了
No, you're misunderstanding, Mr. Beneke.

447
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,390
打电话已经晚了  现在得开支票了
Phone-call time is over. This is check-writing time.

448
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,320
简直疯了  斯凯勒绝不会这样对我的
This is crazy. Skyler would never do this to me.

449
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,920
赶紧坐下  开支票
Sit down and write!

450
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,110
这就对了
There you go.

451
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,320
617,226美元
$617,226

452
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,680
31美分
and 31...

453
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,390
很好
Yeah. Right.

454
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,030
这才听话嘛
You got it.

455
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,350
修尔  现在高兴了吗
Huell, you happy?

456
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,360
修尔高兴了
Huell's happy.

457
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,210
好吧
All right.

458
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,910
别的我们都帮你填写好了
Everything else has been filled out for you.

459
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,310
我们只需要
All's we need

460
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,010
你在这里
is a signature

461
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,530
签个名
right there.

462
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,490
很好
Great.

463
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,190
困难的都做完了
Hard part's over.

464
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,030
接下来
Here's what happens next.

465
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,130
修尔留在这里陪你
Huell's gonna hang here with you.

466
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,959
我争取在五点之前
I'm gonna make sure I get this down to UPS

467
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,450
把这个寄出去
before 5 o'clock.

468
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,780
回来的路上买点三明治
On the way back, I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

469
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,600
然后接下来的几天  咱们三个
The three of us can hang out,

470
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,860
可以一起打打牌  看看电视什么的
play cards or watch TV or whatever

471
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,990
直到你的支票兑现为止
for the next couple of days until the check clears.

472
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,650
没问题吧
Painless, right?

473
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,650
除非你这连有线电视都没有
Unless you don't have cable,

474
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,190
那可就糟透了
in which case is gonna suck.

475
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,300
那么
So...

476
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,530
非得让我躲在脏布堆里吗
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

477
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,210
不是
Nope.

478
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,930
有人在这里制过毒
Someone cooked here.

479
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,890
你失踪了四天
You've been out of commission four days.

480
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,280
你以为没了你
Think we're gonna shut down the whole operation

481
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,770
我们就不开工了吗
just for you?

482
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,700
是谁  谁制的毒
Who cooked? Who was here?

483
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,000
那些后空翻是怎么做出来得
Now, how are you doing all those backflips?

484
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,480
-告诉我  -小子
- Tell me. - Chico.

485
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,970
我要追上你了
Oh. Oh, I'm gonna get you.

486
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,080
要追上了
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

487
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,910
跳
Jump.

488
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,970
按动手柄
You're just pressing buttons,

489
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,569
就能玩出各种花样
and it makes you do magical stuff.

490
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,220
-才不是  -就是
- No. - Yes.

491
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,610
你作弊
Cheater.

492
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,009
谁赢了
Who's winning?

493
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,560
我
I...

494
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,630
看看你  看看
Look at you. Look at...

495
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,200
-我做了101次后空翻  -你
- 101 backflips I did. - Oh, you.

496
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,510
你先替我玩
Hey, keep it going.

497
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,609
放松  放轻松
Relax, relax.

498
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,310
你麻烦大了
Oh, you're in trouble.

499
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,780
老妈出马
Mama's in the house.

500
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,580
杰西
Jesse.

501
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,380
干什么  我很忙
What do you want? I'm busy.

502
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,820
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

503
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,800
我没话和你说
I got nothing to say to you, man.

504
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,150
杰西  求你了  我很抱歉
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

505
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,220
一分钟  只要一分钟
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

506
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,260
从这里滚出去
Get the hell outta my house.

507
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,810
滚
Come on.

508
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,370
给我一分钟
Just give me one minute!

509
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,370
听我解释
Let me just explain myself here.

510
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,980
好吧  听我
Okay. Let me--

511
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,210
闭嘴
Shh! Shut up.

512
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,450
好  好
All right. All right. Okay. Okay.

513
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,250
我很抱歉
All right. I'm sorry.

514
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,100
我知道
I know

515
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,960
你在一个人制毒
that you have been cooking without me.

516
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,120
是啊  所以呢
That's right. So what?

517
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,910
"所以呢"
"So what"?

518
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,400
你说呢  难道你看不出
Isn't it obvious to you

519
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,400
古斯在打什么主意吗
what Gus is planning?

520
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,230
他想让你代替我
He's going to use you to replace me.

521
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,270
他觉得你不再需要我了
He doesn't think you need me anymore.

522
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,610
杰西
Jesse--

523
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,040
杰西  如果你同意取代我的话
Jesse, if you agree to replace me,

524
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,010
他会杀了我的
he will kill me.

525
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,200
你把你的连襟带到了实验室
You brought your brother-in-law to our lab.

526
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,859
你他妈的有毛病啊
What the hell's wrong with you?

527
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,310
那不是我的错  杰西  求你了
That's not my fault. Jesse, please--

528
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,810
杰西 听我说
OK, look, Jesse

529
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,760
你得帮我  求你了
You gotta help me. Please.

530
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,760
上一次我找你帮忙的时候
The last time I asked for your help,

531
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,390
你对我说
you said

532
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,030
"希望我被装进塑料桶“
"I hope you end up buried

533
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,850
”埋在墨西哥的沙漠里"
in a barrel in the Mexican desert."

534
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,250
你完了
You are done.

535
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,020
被炒了
Fired.

536
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,980
不要再去实验室
Do not show your face at the laundry again.

537
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,430
远离平克曼
Stay away from Pinkman.

538
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,900
永远
Do not go near him.

539
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,930
不要靠近他一步
Ever.

540
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,720
听见了吗
Are you listening to me?

541
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,000
不然怎样
Or else you'll do what?

542
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,030
你说什么
What did you say?

543
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,750
远离平克曼
Stay away from Pinkman...

544
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,860
不然的话
or else you'll do...

545
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,730
你要怎样
what?

546
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,950
杀了我
Kill me?

547
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,960
如果你能杀我
If you could kill me,

548
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,920
你早就下手了
I'd already be dead.

549
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,210
但你不能
But you can't.

550
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,200
你不能杀我
You can't kill me

551
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,060
因为如果你杀了我
because Jesse wouldn't cook for you

552
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,030
杰西就不会帮你制毒
if you did.

553
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,070
对不对
That's it, isn't it?

554
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,680
尽管你千方百计挑拨我们反目
No matter how hard you tried to turn him against me,

555
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,950
给他洗脑
screw with his head

556
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,920
让他恨我
so that he would hate my guts,

557
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,120
可他还是
and he still...

558
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,120
不许你杀我
won't let you do it.

559
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,540
暂时而已
For now.

560
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,550
他会想通的
But he'll come around.

561
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,920
同时  你连襟的问题
In the meantime, there's the matter of your brother-in-law.

562
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,050
你承诺过会解决的
He is a problem you promised to resolve.

563
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,390
但你失败了
You have failed.

564
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,190
现在轮到我来对付他了
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

565
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,310
不行
You can't--

566
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,250
如果你胆敢阻拦我
If you try to interfere,

567
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,650
那问题就会简单多了
this becomes a much simpler matter.

568
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,130
我会杀了你老婆
I will kill your wife.

569
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,170
你儿子
I will kill your son.

570
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,110
还有你那刚出生的女儿
I will kill your infant daughter.

571
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,930
太棒了
Great.

572
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,390
这下可好  我才刚跟她说
Perfect, you know. This is just...

573
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,700
你们是我最得意的手下
I told her you were my A-team.

574
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,210
那是天意
It was an act of God.

575
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,010
天意不可违啊
Ain't no accounting for no act of God.

576
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,850
至少支票已经寄出去了
Check's in the mail, at least.

577
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,909
你好  怀特夫人
Oh, hello, Mrs. White.

578
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,780
好消息是国税局的帐已经付清了
The good news is the IRS has been paid off.

579
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,930
坏消息是
The bad news is...

580
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,370
天呐
Jesus!

581
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,000
不管那么多了
Well, here goes nothing.

582
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,109
悠着点
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

583
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,210
-怎么回事  -索尔
- What the... - Saul.

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,910

- What the hell happened to you? - Saul, Saul,

589
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,510
你之前跟我提过的那个人
this man that we spoke of before--

590
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,550
你说这个人

00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,070
能帮我消失  让我过上崭新的生活

592
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,920
-对  -还能确保我永远不被发现

593
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,600
-对  -我需要他

594
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,010
索尔  古斯准备杀我全家
Saul, Gus is gonna murder my whole family.

595
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,790
天啊
Oh, Christ.

598
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,539
你应该明白这可没有回头路
You understand there's no coming back from this?

599
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,600
你会得到新的社保号码和新的身份证

600
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,610
不可以再联系朋友或亲戚

602
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,909
你怎么说服
How are you gonna sell this

603
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,780
你妻子和你十几岁的儿子
to that wife of yours and your teenage son?

604
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,210
我别无选择
I have got no choice.

605
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,420
有极端危险分子想要你的命
You're wanted by some pretty scary individuals,

606
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,609
再加上法网难逃
not to mention the law.

607
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,950
你属于个高危顾客
You're a high-risk client.

得用顶配服务才行
You're gonna need the deluxe service.

-需要花费...  -多少钱

The last quote I got on the deluxe was 125 grand.

611

612
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,230
至少得50万才行
It's gonna be at least half a million.

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,920
-而且他只收现金  -我有现金  赶紧

这是一家吸尘器修理公司
This-- This is a vacuum cleaner repair company.

617
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,999
你以为会是什么名头  伊斯兰快速藏匿公司不成
What'd you expect, Haji's Quick-Vanish?

618
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,310
