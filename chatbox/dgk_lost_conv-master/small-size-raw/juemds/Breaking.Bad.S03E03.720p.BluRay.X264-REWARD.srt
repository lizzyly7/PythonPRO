1
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,007
添酒

2
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,025
再来一杯

3
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:27,085
悠着点喝  先生

4
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:30,047
今天天气炎热

5
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,065
总是会让人心烦意乱

6
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,046
稍不慎就会怒气冲天

7
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,035
这个世界上有两种人

8
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,030
一种是喝酒的人

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,036
另一种是倒酒的人

10
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:47,056
闭上你的狗嘴  给我满上

11
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,095
喂  你们俩个

12
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:01,095
对  就是你们

13
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:04,033
我以前也跟你们一样

14
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,082
为老板埋头苦干

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,065
但后来不干了

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,035
因为我意识到在水龙头前排队等候

17
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:16,045
是永远无法喝饱水的

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,043
听他一句吧

19
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:21,037
你们会受益匪浅的

20
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:26,095
近来可好啊  老板

21
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,025
见到你真好啊  朋友

22
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:37,065
我从没想过你会有如此深的感触啊

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,082
我想我该写本书了

24
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:42,005
可以一试  可以一试

25
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:49,036
什么风把你吹到这个不起眼的小地方来啦

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,085
我就知道能在这里找到你

27
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,085
你没有东西要交付的吗

28
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,000
没时间了  不是吗

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,066
不急  有的是时间

30
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:07,020
玳瑁出门可能会晚

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,025
但他总能

32
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,060
第一个搞定

33
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:12,015
是啊  人如其名

34
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:15,065
我喜欢你说话的方式  玳瑁

35
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,045
是吗

36
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:20,015
你讲话的方式

37
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:24,055
就像瀑布一泻而下

38
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,061
我喜欢这样的你

39
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:36,065
我太笨了  居然错过了你的生日

40
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,083
不  我深感自责

41
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:42,062
所以我不远千里来此小镇

42
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,030
为你送上礼物

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,055
礼物么

44
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:48,085
算了  老板  别麻烦了

45
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,005
不麻烦  我乐意之至

46
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,015
我放在后面了

47
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,035
后面

48
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,012
是啊  来吧  跟我来

49
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,017
太赞了

50
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,015
你真的喜欢

51
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,007
爱死了

52
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,038
多么好的宠物啊

53
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,003
谢谢你  老板

54
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,044
好极了

55
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:29,025
我给你写上签名

56
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,082
写上

57
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:38,006
赠予侃爷

他还活着
He's still breathing.

73

看他的样子  似乎并不知情
By the looks of him, he has no idea how close he came.

我猜索尔·古德曼不必知晓

Hang on, baby.

喂
Hello.

79
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,093
沃尔特  你在家里吗
Walt, are you in the house?

80
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,040
你好  斯凯勒
Oh, hey, Skyler.

81
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:11,044
对  我在家
Yeah, it's me.

82
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:16,005
你在搞什么鬼
What-- What the hell are you doing in there?

83
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:17,072
我搬回来了
I'm back.

84
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:20,005
不不  你不能搬回来
No. No, you're not back.

85
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,042
沃尔特  你不能搬回来
Walt, you're not back.

86
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:23,022
给  我  滚出去
Get-- Get-- Get out of there.

87
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,079
这也是我的家  斯凯勒
Well, it's-- it's my house, too, Skyler.

88
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,077
我要住这儿  就这样
I'm staying. End of story.

89
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,003
我们有过协议
We had an agreement.

90

我什么也没同意
I didn't agree to anything.

91
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,040
听着  先进屋吧
Now, look, just come on inside,

92
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,083
我们好好谈谈好吗
and we'll talk this through, okay?

93
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:39,003
不用了  我们之间没什么好谈了
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

94
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,060
你不滚出去  我是不会踏进家里一步的
I am not coming in there until you get out.

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,017
好吧
Well...

96
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,030
你请自便
suit yourself.

97

沃尔特  沃尔特
Walt. Walt?

98
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,072
你发什么神经
What is wrong with you?

99
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:21,038
斯凯勒  我有权住在家里
Skyler, I have every right to be here.

100
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,023
不  你没有
No, you don't.

101
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,033
你不能再住这家了
You don't live here anymore.

102
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,077
我们离婚了
We're getting a divorce.

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,040
我没同意离婚
I don't agree to a divorce.

104
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,070
由不得你
It's not up to you.

105
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,015
如果你不马上离开
If you don't get out of here right now,

106
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,028
我就报警
I'm going to call the police

107
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:39,085
然后把一切都告诉他们
and I'm going to tell them everything.

108
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:42,072
我说到做到  沃尔特
I mean it, Walt.

我要报警  我被人骚扰
Yes, I-- I want to report a disturbance, please.

115
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:31,013
也不算是骚扰
No, no, it's not-- it's not exactly--

116
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,017
是
It's, um...

117
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,073
是家庭纠纷
It's a domestic issue.

118
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:38,027
好的
Okay.

119
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,098
他们正在询问我
They're connecting me.

120
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:48,078
我发誓  我会全盘托出
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

121
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:51,022
做你该做的吧  斯凯勒
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

122
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,005
这个家是我的一切
This family is everything to me.

123
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,046
失去了家  我还有什么好怕的
Without it, I have nothing to lose.

124
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,002
好吧
Fine.

125
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:06,016
喂  我叫斯凯勒·怀特

即将成为前夫的男人闯入我家

140
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:41,033
你...你怎么这么早就回来了
Why-- Why are you home so soon?

141
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,076
我...我没有啊
I-- I'm not.

142
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,067
我超饿  来点焗芝士三文治怎么样
Hey, I am starving. How about a grilled cheese?

143
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,020
-好啊  当然  -你也要一份吗
- Yeah, sure.  - You want one, too?

144
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,012
沃尔特  我和你爸爸有些事要谈
Walter, your dad and I have something we need to discuss.

145
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:54,004
你的三明治做好时
When your sandwich is ready,

146
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,027
我给你拿到你的...你的屋里
I'll bring it to your-- to your room.

147
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,054
妈妈  能等一等吗
Mom, can't it wait?

148
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,018
我感觉已经好久好久没有见过爸爸了
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

149
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,077
沃尔特
Walter--

150
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,001
那你明天要去上班吗
So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?

151
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,030
是的  我打算去上班
Yeah, that's the plan.

152
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,048
你好  女士
Hello, ma'am.

153
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:39,084
我们来处理一起骚扰事件
We were called about a disturbance?

154
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:43,028
其实更准确说是擅自进入  但是...
It's more of a trespassing situation, really, but--

155
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,088
是的  是我报的警
Yeah, that was me.

156
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:51,049
你居然报警抓爸爸
You called the cops on dad?

157
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:57,039
我...我下班回家
I, uh-- I came home from work,

158
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,063
看见他回来了
and he was back.

159
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,016
他就这样搬回来住了
He just moved back into the house.

160
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,060
然后我叫他离开  但他不听
And I asked him to leave, but he won't listen.

161
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,070
我只是
I just--

162
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,024
我...我想让他离开
I-- I want him out.

163
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,077
我想让他离开这个家
I want him out of the house.

164
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,094
好的  怀特女士  有几个问题
Okay, Mrs. White. There's a couple of questions

165
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,054
需要你立刻回答
I need to ask you right off the bat.

166
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,017
你必须如实回答  这很重要
It's very important that you answer them honestly.

167
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,007
他打你了吗
Did he strike you?

168
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:20,044
没有
No.

169
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:22,004
他曾经打过你吗
Has he ever hit you?

170
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,081
没有  这和家庭暴力无关
No. This is not about violence.

171
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:27,028
只是擅自进入
This is about trespassing,

172
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:30,018
是他违背我个人意愿的擅自闯入
about him being here against my will.

173
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:31,095
好的  擅自闯入
Okay. Trespassing.

174
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,058
你们离婚了吗
You're divorced, then?

175
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,082
没有  正着手进行
No, working on it.

176
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,059
现在我们处于分居中
Right now we're separated.

177
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:40,005
法定分居吗
Legally separated?

178
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,059
如果你是指法院指令的分居  不是的
Well, there's not a court order, if that's what you mean,

179
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:46,019
但我们已经分居了两周左右的时间
but we've been living apart for almost two weeks, give or take--

180
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,089
我换了锁
I changed the locks.

181
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:50,015
难道这不算破门而入吗
Isn't that breaking and entering?

182
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,087
这栋房子归谁名下
Whose name is on the title to the house?

183
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:55,023
我们两个人的  是共同所有
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

184
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:58,010
我们不能因他闯入自己的房子而逮捕他
We can't arrest a man for breaking into his own house,

185
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,030
除非有法院指令
not without a court order

186
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:01,017
要求他远离上述房屋的情况
requiring he stays away from the premises,

187
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:03,030
又或者他曾以任何方式威胁你或孩子
unless he's threatened you or the kids in any way.

188
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,047
不  没有
No, not--

189
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,092
没有身体上的威胁  但让他留在这栋房子里
not physically, but having him in the house is just--

190
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:12,008
不是件好事
It's not a good thing.

191
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:15,062
-不好意思  -别哭了  爸爸在这儿呢
- Excuse me. - Don't cry. Daddy's here.

192
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:17,015
我来哄她  亲爱的
I got her, honey.

193
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,088
爸爸抱
Oh, come here.

194
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:20,089
这样好了吧
There we go.

195
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,072
你饿了吗
You hungry?

196
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,065
你饿了吗
You hungry?

197
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,066
来吧
Here we go.

198
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,026
真乖
Oh, that was it.

199
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:31,053
我很抱歉  长官  我们说到哪儿了
I'm sorry, Officer. Where were we?

200
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,093
意见分歧
Disagreements.

201
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:36,073
是的  我们在很多事情上有争议
Yeah, so we've had our share of that.

202
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:39,083
我...我没有
Um, I-- I haven't...

203
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,030
近来  我不是一个体贴的丈夫
I haven't been the most attentive husband lately.

204
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:47,021
怀特女士  如果我们到外面谈的话
Mrs. White, would this be easier

205
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,044
对你来说会不会好受些
if we stepped outside for a minute?

206
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,027
不用了
No.

207
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:55,054
不用了
No.

208
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:58,095
我在这儿很好
I'm fine right here.

209
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,065
我跟你说实话  女士
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

210
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,018
如果你想让你的丈夫离开这栋房子
If you want your husband out of the house,

211
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,009
你必须得和我合作
you're gonna have to help me out.

212
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:07,019
你是否知道  他有没有触犯过某条法律
Is it possible maybe he's broken any laws that you know of?

213
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:09,029
任何违法的事
Anything at all.

214
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:11,070
任何我们可以用到的  直说无妨
Anything that we can work with here, just tell me.

215
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:14,003
即使你认为他有犯法的嫌疑也行
Even if you've just got a suspicion of wrongdoing,

216
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,027
会有用的
I can work with that.

217
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,027
我能以此将他赶出去
I'll get him out of the house for you.

218
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,024
你对这事有什么看法吗
What's your take on all this?

219
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:22,015
是...是我妈妈的错
It-- It's my mom's fault.

220
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:26,028
我  她都没说过我爸爸做错了什么
I--she won't even say what my dad did

221
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:29,086
事实是他什么都没做错
and it's because he didn't do anything.

222
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,053
我不懂她为什么要这样
I don't know why she's being this way.

223
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,073
我的...我的爸爸
My-- My dad--

224
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:37,083
他是个好人
...he is a great guy.

225
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,050
怀特女士
Mrs. White?

226
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,034
我很抱歉  女士
I'm sorry, ma'am.

227
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:52,018
没有法律依据便不能将你的丈夫赶出去
There's no legal basis for us to remove your husband from the house.

228
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:56,035
下次你觉得事情要失控时
Next time you feel like things are getting out of control,

229
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,094
就打这个电话
you should call this number.

230
00:14:57,094 --> 00:15:00,012
这是家庭专线
It's the family hotline.

231
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,012
我很愿意为你提供咨询
I'd really look into some counseling.

232
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,015
祝你们好运
Best of luck to you folks.

233
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,002
多谢  长官  抱歉让你们跑一趟
Listen, thank you, officers. We're sorry.

234
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,023
你为什么要...
Why do you got to...

235
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:20,003
你为什么要这么对爸爸
Why do you got to do this to Dad?

236
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,030
小沃尔特  等等
Jr.Wait. Come on.

237
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,027
不要怪你妈妈
Don't blame your mother for this.

238
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,037
对不起
Sorry.

239
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,049
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

240
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,066
他还活着
He lives!

241
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:35,076
恭喜乔迁  小子
Happy housewarming, kid.

242
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,063
-看见我别这么开心  -谢谢
- Don't look so glad to see me. - Thanks.

243
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:40,079
装修不错
Interesting decor.

244
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,043
说来有趣
It's, uh, subtle.

245
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:45,099
我对简约艺术一直不感冒
The whole minimalist thing never really blew my hair back,

246
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,067
过得怎么样
So, how are you doing?

247
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,033
没吸毒吧
You staying clean?

248
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,040
很好
Good.

249
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:56,074
一直没有你的消息  我担心你
I was kind of worried that you were back to old habits,

250
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:59,001
旧瘾复发来着
since I didn't hear from you, you know?

251
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,054
你有没有意识到
Realize how stupid it is

252
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,025
不接自己律师的电话很愚蠢呢
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

253
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,091
若我来电话警告你毒品缉私局
What if I was trying to warn you

254
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,072
要上门来抓你呢
that the DEA was going to kick down your door?

255
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,012
我是说  那可怎么办哪
I mean, what then, huh?

256
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:09,072
别拐弯抹角了
Why don't you spare me the sermon

257
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,032
直说你来干嘛吧
and get to why you're here?

258
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,059
好吧
Fair enough.

259
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,009
记不记得那天
Remember the other day

260
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:15,059
我跟你提过
when I brought up the idea

261
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,069
让你和老搭档联络联络
of you getting back in touch with your, uh, partner?

262
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:20,056
我想重新解释一下
Well, I kind of wanted to refloat that boat.

263
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,066
我没有让你继续制毒的意思
I'm not suggesting that you yourself get back to cooking,

264
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,046
我明白你金盆洗手了
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

265
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,040
我只是想让你  劝劝首席毒师重操旧业
I only want you to convince the master chef to do his thing,

266
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:32,043
你意下如何
So what do you say?

267
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,030
知道了  伙计  随你
Sure, man. Whatever.

268
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:35,084
别呀  什么随我
Okay. Whatever what?

269
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,047
你会不会给他打电话
I mean, you going to call him?

270
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:40,007
我说了  交给我了
I said I'll handle it.

271
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,081
走吧  成不
Now bounce, will you?

272
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,081
请吧
Please?

273
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:44,021
最后一句
Final thought.

274
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,005
看看这房子
Look at this place.

275
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,032
空无一物的
You're house poor.

276
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,075
你又没有经济来源
You got no bankroll.

277
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,066
你要是能让大毒师重新制毒
If you get the maestro cooking again,

278
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,073
我必有重谢
I'll make it worth your while.

279
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,086
打电话给他
Call him.

280
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,020
喂  如果你想向我推销东西
Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,

281
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,067
我给你四个字
I've got four little words for you...

282
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,000
谢绝推销
Do not call list.

283
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:50,027
如果不是呢  在嘀声后留言
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.

284
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,002
施拉德
Schrader.

285
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:17,003
是我  长官  什么事
Yes, Sir? Yeah, what's up?

286
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:20,063
是吗
Yeah?

287
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,094
真是好消息  谢谢长官
That's great news, Sir. Thank you.

288
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,021
好的  好的  当然
Ah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

289
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,037
那是一定的
You can bet on that.

290
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:33,048
再次谢谢你  长官
Hey, listen, thanks again, Sir.

291
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,014
非常感谢你帮我这个大忙
I really appreciate you stepping to the plate.

292
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,018
谢谢
Thank you.

293
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:42,018
你就打算让我蒙在鼓里吗
You going to keep me in suspense or what?

294
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,035
什么好消息
What's the good news?

295
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:45,025
默克特来电话告诉我好消息
Merkert called in a couple of favors.

296
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,072
埃尔帕索让我回去
El Paso wants me back. Aaah!

297
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:51,009
恭喜了老兄  太棒了
Hey, man, congrats, man. That's fantastic.

298
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,059
谢谢
Thank you.

299
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,083
你好
Hello.

300
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:10,075
先生们  欢迎光临

301
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,020
感谢你的到来

302
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,056
入境没遇到问题吧

303
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:19,004
我要是连边境都过不来  就该退休了

304
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,006
请进吧

305
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:25,086
抱歉这门不能走轮椅

306
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,096
我们很抱歉  古斯塔沃

307
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:41,076
我们本该事先通知你

308
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:45,081
这里是你的地盘  你要管辖无可厚非

309
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,083
但是

310
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:51,023
我们相信  那人与你并无瓜葛

311
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,096
可我们确实有关系

312
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:57,033
这么说  你和这位海森堡有生意来往咯

313
00:22:57,056 --> 00:23:00,015
我不知道他还用过这个名字  但确有其事

314
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,041
我从不掩饰

315
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:06,071
我经常与本地制造商合作

316
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:11,066
我们俩仍然一同谋利

317
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:16,096
此事绝不会影响到我们的关系

318
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,057
塞拉曼加老师有一个叫屠库的侄子

319
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:24,004
我有耳闻

320
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:28,049
那你该知道  塞拉曼加老师亲自教他入行

321
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:31,066
待他亲如己出

322
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:37,003
后来塞拉曼加老师年老  屠库继承他的衣钵

323
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:40,048
他是我们集团在边境线北边的重要人物

324
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,086
非常忠诚

325
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:45,066
这位海森堡  沃尔特·怀特

326
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:48,045
是屠库的本地供货商之一

327
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,076
可是他背叛了屠库

328
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:55,095
现在  你该了解了  血债必须血偿

329
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,092
这是屠库的两位堂兄弟

330
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:00,076
他们有权报仇雪恨

331
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,049
塞拉曼加家族和我们集团

332
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,090
在这个问题上的观点是一致的

333
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,096
塞拉曼加老师

334
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,093
先生们

335
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:15,040
我能理解你们的悲恸

336
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:19,014
请你们节哀

337
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:25,066
我承认  你们确实有权利复仇

338
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:31,067
但我现在  仍与此人有生意上的合作

339
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:35,006
等我把生意做完

340
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:40,016
他便不再与我有任何瓜葛了

341
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,076
在那之前

342
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:49,017
我需要他活着

343
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,090
借一步说话

344
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,086
古斯塔沃  我不干涉你怎么炸鸡排

345
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:18,069
你也不该干涉我集团的政策

346
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:22,027
那我的地盘我就不管了吗

347
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:23,060
当然也要管

348
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:25,092
我会让他们耐心些

349
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:29,046
但我也劝你尽快搞定和这个家伙的生意

350
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,052
稍有不慎他就会影响到我们的合作关系

351
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:34,072
那样可不明智啊

352
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,046
里面那两个男人

353
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:43,012
我也不敢保证他们能听我的话

354
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:46,089
可不像你我这般理智

355
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,033
喂  如果你想向我推销东西
Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,

356
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,077
我给你四个字
I've got four little words for you...

357
00:26:14,077 --> 00:26:15,097
谢绝推销
Do not call list.

358
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:18,011
如果不是呢  在嘀声后留言
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.

359
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,095
喂  如果你想向我推销东西
Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,

360
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,039
我给你四个字
I've got four little words for you...

361
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,069
谢绝推销
Do not call list.

362
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:37,011
如果不是呢  在嘀声后留言
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.

363
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,085
喂  如果你想向我推销东西
Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,

364
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:43,022
我给你四个字
I've got four little words for you...

365
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,071
亲爱的
Oh, swtheart.

366
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:28,045
宝贝对不起  对不起
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

367
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:32,009
没事  没事了  宝贝
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

368
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:35,022
好了  没事了
Oh, yes. It's okay.

369
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:38,009
没事了  妈妈就在这
It's okay. Mama's got you.

370
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:41,079
妈妈就在这
Oh, Mama's got you, yeah.

371
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:44,006
睡吧睡吧
Yes. Oh.

372
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:48,030
斯凯勒  要我帮忙吗
Skyler, want some help?

373
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:02,051
斯凯勒  我能用下洗手间吗
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

374
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,099
我的老天
God.

375
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,074
你说的什么意思  跟你作对吗
What do you mean? Against your will?

376
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,054
是的  还相当顽固
Yes. Very much against my will.

377
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:42,071
他突然就回来了
He just...He...he showed right back up,

378
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,088
而且他也不同意离婚
and he...he doesn't want a divorce.

379
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:47,021
毫不犹豫的反对了
Won't even consider it.

380
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:51,015
我甚至打电话让警察带他走
I...I called the police on him.

381
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,072
我甚至差点就
I...I was...I was so close...

382
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,029
差点怎么了
So close to what?

383
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:58,029
没什么  算了
Nothing. Never mind.

384
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:02,016
斯凯勒  如果你不告诉我真相
Skyler, I can't advise you properly

385
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:03,086
我无法帮到你
if you don't give me all the facts.

386
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,070
根据律师与当事人的保密协议
Understand I am bound by the attorney-client privilege

387
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:09,070
我必须为你守口如瓶
to keep everything you tell me a secret.

388
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:13,030
未经你同意  我不会泄露只字片语
I can't tell a soul unless you authorize me to.

389
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,007
就算是非法的  你也可以保密吗
Even if it's something illegal?

390
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:18,097
非法的事  尤其保密
Especially if it's illegal.

391
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,091
我是你的律师  不是警察
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

392
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:24,001
我的工作就是保护你
My job is to protect you.

393
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:35,072
我丈夫私造甲基苯丙胺
My husband makes meth.

394
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,039
就是冰毒
Methamphetamine.

395
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:44,013
你丈夫是毒贩
Your husband's a drug dealer.

396
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,020
他只是生产毒品
A manufacturer.

397
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:48,033
在行话里
Technically, they, uh,

398
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,020
叫做毒师
they-- they call them cooks.

399
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,054
我是在网上找的
I looked it up on the Internet.

400
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:57,071
我给你个忠告  并希望你能听取
This is my advice, and you should take it.

401
00:29:57,074 --> 00:30:00,044
马上向法院申请离婚
Sue your husband for divorce immediately.

402
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,092
然后我就到警局
Let me go to the police

403
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,041
举报你刚才告诉我的事
and tell them what you've just told me.

404
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:05,075
我这边呢
I'll go in ex parte

405
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:08,015
最快今天就能拿到法院的限制令
and get a restraining order from the court today.

406
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:10,025
只要他企图接近你或你的孩子
If he comes anywhere near you and your children,

407
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:13,009
无需多言  立刻被抓进监狱
he goes straight to jail, no questions asked.

408
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,082
毋庸置疑
This is a no-brainer.

409
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:17,086
这样做对你和你的家庭最有利
It's the best thing for you and your family.

410
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,056
不行
I can't.

411
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,070
我做不到
I can't do it.

412
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:30,054
我不想让我儿子发现
I don't want my son to find out

413
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:32,064
他的父亲是个罪犯
that his father is a criminal.

414
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,051
我只是
I just...

415
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:37,094
我不能这样对他
I can't do that to him.

416
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:41,058
到最后可能就由不得你了
In the end, it may not be up to you.

417
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:44,012
毒贩终究逃不过法律制裁的
Drug dealers have a way of getting caught.

418
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:50,016
沃尔特患有肺癌
Walt has lung cancer.

419
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,023
治疗虽然控制住了他的病情
His treatment bought him some time,

420
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:53,069
但医生们都说
but the doctors, they all say

421
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,039
迟早他都会...
that sooner or later--

422
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:58,060
连我自己都不清楚
But I can't see why

423
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,080
为什么家里发生了这些事
I should lay all this on my family

424
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,094
但我却
when...things may...

425
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:10,068
让其放任自流
resolve themselves on their own

426
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:14,091
而又不惊动其他人
without anyone else knowing.

427
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:23,023
伙计  我跟你打赌输了钱吗
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

428
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,053
干嘛要带我来这种地方
What are we doing in this shore?

429
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,077
没事的  放轻松
Just relax, will you?

430
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,053
放轻松  在这种鬼地方稍有不慎就被捅死
Relax? This is the kind of place you get knifed.

431
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,014
来这还不如去"小辣椒"
We should have went to Chili's, man.

432
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,090
伙计  既来之则安之
All right, already. Jesus.

433
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:35,064
牛排餐厅也不错
Outback Steakhouse.

434
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,067
现在去也不晚啊
It's not too late.

435
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,068
他们那有开胃洋葱条
They got that Blooming Onion.

436
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:41,011
偶尔吃点辣的有什么关系呢
What's wrong with spicing things up a little bit, huh?

437
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:45,075
这辣椒像被人吃过一样恶心
This spice looks like it's been through a couple of guys already.

438
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:48,045
你准备什么时候回埃尔帕索
So when are you headed back down to El Paso?

439
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,079
你知道
Uh, you know,

440
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:52,082
打包收拾再交接班
between the packing and errands and, uh,

441
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:55,056
再把事情安排好  估计还得一两周吧
getting my ducks in a row, maybe, um, a week or two.

442
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:57,053
还要一两周  拜托  伙计
A week or two? Come on, man.

443
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,050
要是我早麻利地回去了
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

444
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:02,003
是啊  但这边也还有工作要做完啊
Yeah, well, it's not like there's nothing going on up here.

445
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,040
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

446
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:05,010
这里能有什么事
There ain't jack going on up here.

447
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,070
风平浪静
It's quiet as hell.

448
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:09,097
我去洗把脸
I'm going to hit the head.

449
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,020
那边的两个家伙
Those two over there.

450
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,097
我觉得他们身上有货
I think they're holding.

451
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:51,004
伙计  这种鬼地方  酒保身上都可能有货
Man, in this place, the bartender's probably holding.

452
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,078
你干什么
Whoa. What are you doing?

453
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:59,095
打给本地警方  还能干什么
Calling APD. What do you think?

454
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:02,042
难道我俩还搞不定两个小喽啰
Since when can't we handle a couple of dirtballs?

455
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,096
拜托伙计  好歹做做样子
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

456
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:06,086
万一是上头派的卧底呢
What if Vice is running some kind if undercover op?

457
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,093
见鬼
Screw it.

458
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,007
该你请客了
It's your turn to pay.

459
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,099
你干什么去
Where are you going?

460
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:51,026
我去上厕所
I have to take a leak.

461
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,062
天  你该吃点坦洛新了[前列腺药物]
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

462
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:06,044
站起来
Stand up.

463
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:17,054
你是看我们哪里不爽  贱人
Do you got a problem with us, bitch?

464
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,018
你一动我就不爽
Your move.

465
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,069
毒品缉私局  都不许动
DEA! Don't move.

466
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:57,076
去把我搭档给我叫进来
Go and tell my partner to get his ass in here.

467
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,018
喂  如果你想向我推销东西
Hey, if you're trying to sell me something,

468
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,062
我给你四个字
I've got four little words for you...

469
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:37,092
谢绝推销
Do not call list.

470
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:40,060
如果不是呢  在嘀声后留言
However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.

471
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,073
喂  如果你想向我推销东西

472
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:55,006

00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,069
谢绝推销
Do not call list.

474
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,059
您所呼叫的区号为505
The number you have reached 1494985

475
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:17,038
号码为1494985的用户已停机
in area code 505 is no longer in service.

476
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,011

00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,067
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

478

辖区负责人想要见你
ASAC wants to see you.

还有呢
And?

480
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:26,083
我们本来持观望态度  毒品交易发生后
We're hanging back. Saw a deal go down.

481
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,054
我去外面请求支援
I went outside to call it in.

482
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,087
你在这里盯着疑犯

你在回里面去之前

486
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,018
把枪放在了座位下面
before you went back inside.

487

我做了件可怕的事情

494

495
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:41,011
买生活用品和汽油的钱

496
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:47,037
办生日派对和毕业派对的钱

497
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:52,012
斯凯勒  这些钱
Skyler, that money

498
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:53,099

我死了后  单凭你做兼职会计

是无法还房屋贷款的

501
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,029
-沃尔特  我  -你收下吧

这笔钱  不是我偷来的
This money... I didn't steal it.

504
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,083
不属于其他任何人
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

505
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:19,077
我赚来的
I earned it.

506
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:30,016
我为了赚这些钱所做的事情
The things I've... done to earn it...

507

我为这个家庭所做的所有的牺牲
all the sacrifices that I have... made for this family,

512
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,058
如果你不肯接受我赚的这些钱
all of that will be for nothing

513
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:07,075
我所有的牺牲都白费了
if you don't accept what I've earned.

514
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,032
请你接受吧
Please.

515
