1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,210
满意了吗
Are we done?

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:06,620
不  不  听我说
No, now listen, I, uh--

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,990
我连襟遭到攻击的事
This attack on my brother-in-law,

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,000
我不  我不明白是什么意思
I don't-- I don't know what it means.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,180
拜托了
Please...

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,040
我为我的家人感到担心
I fear for my family.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,640
我保证他们会没事的
I'm sure they'll be fine.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,800
我听说那个幸存的歹徒受了重伤
I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,180
我想他可能也活不久了
It's doubtful he'll live.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,460
好了  说谢谢然后和我握手
Now thank me and shake my hand.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,170
谢谢你  感激不尽
Uh, thank you. Thank you again.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,700
别客气  怀特先生
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,300
出什么事了
What's happening?

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,250
8点43分
8:43.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,720
死亡时间  8点43分
Time of death, 20:43.

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,870
去地狱吧  你这个人渣
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,820
其中一名疑犯枪手当场死亡
One suspected gunman died at the scene.

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,050
另一名则在当地医院

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,050
伤重不治死亡
earlier this evening at an area hospital.

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,160
毒品管制局和联邦调查局
Agents with the DEA and FBI

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,440
连同阿尔布开克警局凶案组的探员
in conjunction with APD homicide detectives,

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,339
正和墨西哥执法机构一起
are working with Mexico law enforcement

23
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,704
调查此次案件
attempt to identified the suspect

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,410
接下来的我给你讲吧
I can give you highlights.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,950
你的侄子们越来越没有耐心了
Your nephews grew impatient.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,450
一直逼我
They continue to press me

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,650
让我同意杀掉沃尔特・怀特
for my permission to kill Walter White.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,410
在我拒绝后
When I wouldn't give it,

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,080
他们决定取而代之杀掉毒品管制局探员施拉德
they settled instead for DEA agent Schrader.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,110
但在他们动手前
But phone call was placed to Agent Schrader

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,140
有人打电话告诉了施拉德探员
moments before the attack,

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,570
让他占了先机
thus giving him the upper hand.

33
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,740
马尔科脸上中枪当场死亡
Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,080
莱昂内尔勉强支撑几个小时后死亡
Leonel lingered for several hours.

35
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,180
那个打给毒品管制局探员的电话
The warning call to the DEA agent--

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,710
胡安・波萨可能知道
Juan Bolsa may have some insight

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,160
是谁打的
into who placed it.

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,760
但昨天  墨西哥联邦军队冲入他家
But yesterday, the federales were at his hacienda,

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,460
混乱中  他中枪死亡
and in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,580
可能是意外吧
An accident, perhaps.

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,680
没准是他手下干的
A mistake made by his own men,

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,090
只有天知道了
though we may never know.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,240
无论如何  我觉得应该由我来告诉我
At any rate, I thought you should hear from me.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,150
这就叫血债血偿  赫克托
This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,250
血债血偿[西语]
Sangre por sangre.

46
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,710
第四季 第八集
S04E08: Hermanos

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,290
这是很吵的那个吗
So is this the loud one?

48
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,420
什么
What?

49
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,550
我总记不住名字
I can never remember.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,050
这是那个很吵带磁性的机器吗
Is this the loud machine with the magnets?

51
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,020
不  这是个电脑断层扫描
No. This is the PET/CT scan.

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,650
正子断层扫描
Positron emission tomography.

53
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,990
他们是和
They pair that with

54
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,280
X光计算机断层扫描一起做的
the computed X-ray tomography.

55
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,820
很安静  没有磁性
Quiet. No magnets.

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,550
是吗  好吧
Right. Okay.

57
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,230
谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,030
我对这还不太熟
I'm still pretty new at this.

59
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,600
我才刚刚开始新的事业
I mean, one minute I'm starting a new business.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,640
还准备和老婆一起要个孩子
My wife and I are thinking about having kids.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,050
来医院做了个检查  结果就
Walk into a doctor's office, and suddenly, boom--

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,570
-我所理解的人生  -抱歉  稍等
- Life as I know it - Excuse me.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,850
对  我还等着听
Yes. I'm-- I'm waiting to hear a progress report

64
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,680
那件事的进度报告呢
on that thing we discussed.

65
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,210
给我回电话
So call me.

66
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,880
所以对我来说  这个大打击一下敲醒了我
Anyway, so for me, that's been the biggest wake-up call--

67
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,910
放开手  听天由命吧
letting go, giving up control.

68
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,480
老话说的好
It's like they say--

69
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,150
人算不如天算
you know, man plans, and God laughs.

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,080
简直扯淡
That is such bullshit.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,850
什么
Excuse me?

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,210
不要放弃控制
Never give up control.

73
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,950
命运就掌握在你自己手中
Live life on your own terms.

74
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,150
我明白你的意思
Yeah. No. I get what you're saying.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,410
但这可是癌症
But-- But, uh, cancer's cancer, so--

76
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,310
去他妈的癌症
Oh, to hell with your cancer.

77
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,550
癌症这段时间可是我人生中最美好的时候
I've been living with cancer for the better part of a year.

78
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,780
一开始  他们都说
Right from the start, it's a death sentence.

79
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,580
我被判了死刑
It's what they keep telling me.

80
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,480
但是你知道吗
Well, guess what.

81
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,050
人生下来就是要死的
Every life comes with a death sentence.

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,580
每过几个月  我都来做定期扫描
So every few months, I come in here for my regular scan,

83
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,510
明知道随时有可能
knowing full well that one of these times--

84
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,650
没准就是今天
hell, maybe even today--

85
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,010
我会听到坏消息
I'm going to hear some bad news.

86
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,550
但在那之前  我的命掌握在谁手中
But until then, who's in charge?

87
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,810
我自己
Me.

88
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,150
这就是我的人生
That's how I live my life.

89
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,660
如果你用制冷机的水
This residue here is why we descale

90
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,899
而不是水管的水除垢
with cool water from the walk-in

91
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,610
就不会留有这些残渣  记住了吗
and not water from the tap, remember?

92
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,080
-嗯  -请再洗一遍
- Yeah. - Do it again, please.

93
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,610
更多美味更多欢笑就在洛博罗炸鸡馆  你好
Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.

94
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,580
好的  探员
Yes, detective.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,577
古斯塔沃  多谢你过来
Gustavo, thanks for coming in.

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,050
我的荣幸  基思怎么样了
My pleasure. How's Kathi?

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,750
好多了  谢谢你
Much better, thank you.

98
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,650
这位你应该认识  汉克・施拉德
And you know Hank Schrader.

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,710
是的  没错
Ah, yes, indeed.

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,910
还有史蒂芬・戈麦斯
And Steve Gomez.

101
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,580
吃得还满意吗
How was your meal?

102
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,720
前几天我和施拉德探员
Agent Schrader and I had a chance

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,560
在我其中一间餐厅碰过面
to catch up in one of my restaurants a few days ago.

104
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,609
如果不是怕肥得过不了门
I'd eat there every day,

105
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,400
我愿意每天都吃那个
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

106
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,380
-可以开始了吗  -当然
- Well, should we get started? - Yeah.

107
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,850
不介意的话
I'd like to record this conversation,

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,450
-这段对话我要录音  -没问题
- if that's okay. - Of course.

109
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,690
毒品管制局和我们
The DEA is working on an investigation

110
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,930
正在共同调查一起案件
which may overlap with my own,

111
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,880
所以今天才请他过来
so I've asked them to sit in with us today.

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,810
古斯  我们很感谢你
Gus, we all appreciate

113
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,850
愿意过来和我们谈
your coming in here to talk to us,

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,950
但你也有权让你的律师在场
but you have the right to have an attorney present also.

115
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,350
我觉得应该不需要吧
Oh, well, I can't see how that would be necessary.

116
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,580
但我不知道你们为什么找我
But then again I have no idea why I'm here.

117
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,210
那我们继续吧
So you wish to continue?

118
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,580
请  我很想知道原因
Please. I'm very anxious to find out what this is all about.

119
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,150
我们在一个宗罪案现场发现了你的指纹
Sir, your fingerprints were found at a crime scene.

120
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,680
真的吗
Really?

121
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,480
不可思议
That's surprising.

122
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,450
是起和毒品有关的谋杀案
A drug-related homicide.

123
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,980
盖尔・伯蒂彻的公寓吧
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

124
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,510
所以你认识被害人
So you knew the victim.

125
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,680
15年前  我捐助了新墨西哥大学化学奖学金
15 years ago, I established a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

126
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,850
用马克西米诺・阿辛尼耶格的名字命名
I named it after Maximino Arsiniega,

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,080
一个我英年早逝的朋友
a dear friend of mine who died too young.

128
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,810
盖尔获得了奖学金
Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.

129
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,210
他应该是获得奖学金的众多人之一
He was, uh, perhaps one of three dozen.

130
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,380
我知道了
I see.

131
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,680
伯蒂彻先生毕业于
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in...

132
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,710
1999年
1999.

133
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,720
应该没错
That sounds right.

134
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,830
你和他一直都保持联系吗
And you kept in regular contact with him over all this time?

135
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,850
没有  我很多年没见过他了
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,400
直到几个星期前偶然碰到他
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

137
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,710
在哪碰到的
Ran into him where?

138
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,450
在餐厅
At the restaurant.

139
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,509
说"偶遇"可能有点不太恰当
Uh, well, "Ran into" Isn't quite accurate,

140
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,180
我觉得他是特地来找我的
as I assume he came by to re-establish contact with me.

141
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,130
我们聊了一下
We caught up briefly.

142
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,710
他邀请我第二天晚上一起吃饭
He invited me to dinner the following night,

143
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,480
我答应了
and I accepted.

144
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,150
大概一周后
It was, uh, perhaps a week later

145
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,510
我才在报纸上看到他的消息
I read about him in the paper.

146
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,650
你说是和毒品有关
Drug related, you said?

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,880
很有可能
It's a good possibility.

148
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,980
报纸没有提到这一点
The paper made no mention of that.

149
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,840
我还以为是普通谋杀
I assumed that it was a random crime.

150
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,620
他几年都和你没有联系
So after years with no contact,

151
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,540
突然出现在你的餐厅
he shows up in your restaurant,

152
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,540
和你叙叙旧
remakes your acquaintance,

153
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,610
然后邀请你吃晚饭
and invites you to dinner?

154
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,800
是的  因为他需要钱
Yeah, he wanted money.

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,260
盖尔・伯蒂彻找你借钱
Gale Boetticher asked you for money?

156
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,110
他没有直说
He didn't come right out and say that.

157
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,980
只是含糊其辞的说
He spoke in terms

158
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,780
有一个投资的好机会
of a vague investment opportunity,

159
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,580
但我认识他只是想借钱
but it was my suspicion, yes,

160
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,880
因为他邀请我去他家
as to why he invited me into his home.

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,260
他是个很有才华的化学家
He was a very talented chemist,

162
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,350
虽然很有可能创出一番事业
but for reasons I never understood,

163
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,780
但基于某种我不知道的原因
he was more interested in taking shortcuts

164
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,050
他总是想走捷径
than what would or could have been a very promising career.

165
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,120
即使有这样的毛病
But personal shortcomings notwithstanding,

166
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,450
但他仍是个热情  温和的人
he was a warm, gentle person,

167
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,950
我很想念他
and I thought a lot of him.

168
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,520
无论如何
At any rate, I, uh,

169
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,180
我拒绝了他的要求
declined his business offer,

170
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,650
吃晚饭之后我就离开了
and, after what was a very pleasant meal, left.

171
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,150
能告诉我们
Can you tell us where you were

172
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,600
23号星期3晚上8点左右
on the night of Wednesday the 23rd

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,030
你在哪里吗
at around 8 P.M.?

174
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,980
不是指责  只是问一下
Not an accusation, just a question.

175
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,280
我明白  等我想一下
Oh, I understand. Let's see.

176
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,520
23号
23rd.

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,550
7点到10点的时候
I was at a fundraiser at Presbyterian Hospital.

178
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,980
我在长老会医院出席一个筹款活动
I was there from 7 to about 10.

179
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,980
还有谁有问题
Anyone else?

180
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,550
嗯  对不起  我有
Uh, sorry, yeah.

181
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,520
只是  还有一件事
Just, uh, just one other thing.

182
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,950
古斯塔沃・福林是你的真名吗
Uh, is Gustavo Fring your real name?

183
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,759
是不是我的真名
Is it my real name?

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
我知道你生于智利
I know you're a Chilean national,

185
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,880
可是那里完全没有你生活过的记录
but there are no records of you ever living there.

186
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,150
真的吗
Really?

187
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,809
我是说  记录显示
I mean, records show

188
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,409
你在1986年移民墨西哥
that you immigrated to Mexico in 1986,

189
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,679
几年后
and then, a couple of years later,

190
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,620
你获得了美国的入境签证
you were granted an entry visa to the United States.

191
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,859
可是完全没有古斯塔沃・福林
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring

192
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,020
曾经在智利生活的记录
ever having existed in Chile,

193
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,210
这让我觉得很奇怪
which I find-- I don't know-- uh, strange.

194
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,750
其实  一点都不奇怪
Well, really, it isn't.

195
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,150
皮诺切特将军的军政府犯下了很多罪行
General Pinochet's government was guilty of a great many sins.

196
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,020
侵犯人权是其中最大最重的罪行
First and foremost were his human rights abuses.

197
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,140
但是保管文件记录也是极为不可靠
But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.

198
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,350
我敢肯定  只要你继续挖下去  肯定能发现
I'm sure, if you keep digging, you'll find me.

199
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,650
好的  我觉得这就够了  古斯
Okay. I think that's it, Gus.

200
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,650
谢谢你
Uh, thank you.

201
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,410
希望我能起到一些作用
I hope that I was of some small help.

202
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,720
当然了  谢谢你
You were, absolutely. Thank you.

203
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,650
不客气
You're very welcome.

204
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,620
很高兴再次见到您
Good to see you again.

205
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,410
不  不用起身  谢谢你
Oh, no. No, please, please. Thank you.

206
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,710
谢谢
Thanks.

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,820
先生们  告辞
Gentlemen.

208
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,130
我们应该相信么
So, are we buying?

209
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,500
对他名字的问题
This thing with his name--

210
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,730
你觉得智利那边究竟什么问题
what are you thinking there?

211
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,049
当然了  南美那边的记录保存可能是有问题
Sure, the record keeping in South America is hit or miss.

212
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,910
我们也一直遇上这种情况  对不对
I mean, we run into that all the time, right?

213
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,400
但我们总能发现点什么的
We usually find something.

214
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,770
我看  这人在86年之前简直是个幽灵
I mean, before '86, this guy's a ghost.

215
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,010
要是国务院对他的背景不满意
If the State Department wasn't satisfied with his records,

216
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,150
他们不会接受他入籍的
they wouldn't have naturalized him.

217
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,110
有可能
Well, maybe,

218
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,600
可他是89年从墨西哥移民过来的
but he immigrated from Mexico in '89.

219
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,150
那时候国务院的背景调查
You know, the state just wasn't as tough

220
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,900
不像911之后那么严格
on background checks pre-9/11.

221
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,260
就算这样  我也没看出
Regardless, I don't know what this has to do

222
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,620
这和手上的案子有什么关系
with the case at hand.

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,750
当然  我也很好奇
I was definitely curious

224
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,910
为什么他的指纹会出现在伯蒂彻的公寓里
when his prints show up at Boetticher's apartment,

225
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,609
但是  我觉得奖学金的说法说得通
but for me, the scholarship thing explains it.

226
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,969
我承认我有一定的偏袒
Well, I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

227
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,250
这人长期以来一直是毒品管制局的忠实伙伴
This man has been a longtime friend of DEA,

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,970
可是  嗯
but that being said, uh...

229
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,310
我觉得他的故事是可信的
I thought his story was credible.

230
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,160
我同意  这故事的确不错
Well, I agree. I think it was a good story.

231
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
可是  为什么我们现在才听说
Still, why are we hearing it now?

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,710
什么意思
What do you mean?

233
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,380
如你所说
Well, like you said, he's a--

234
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,540
这人是执法部门的好伙伴
this man's a big law enforcement booster.

235
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,559
有一天他在报上读到了
One day he's reading a newspaper

236
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,710
一个刚与他共进晚餐的人的死讯
and sees that somebody he just had dinner with,

237
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,310
这个人他经常想起
somebody he thought a lot of, was murdered.

238
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,110
他读到这段新闻  怎么不打个电话来
He reads this, and he doesn't make a phone call?

239
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,320
没打给你  也没打给其他那些警察朋友们
Doesn't call you or one of his other cop friends

240
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,140
来谈谈他和本案的联系
to share his connection with the case

241
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,140
或者是问问本案的调查进展
or ask about the investigation.

242
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,570
我们不能光凭一个人没打来电话
We can't predicate a criminal investigation

243
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,510
就对他展开调查
on a person not making phone calls.

244
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,110
那你怎么想  提姆
What do you think, Tim?

245
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,380
我想跟进奖学金和不在场证明这两条线
Well, I want to follow up on the scholarship, the alibi.

246
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,740
但是总体来说  我相信他说的
But my overall impression? I believed him.

247
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,840
鸟池做的很不错
Nice touch. Bird bath.

248
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,310
小伙子  过得怎么样
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?

249
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,480
很好
Good.

250
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,410
房子很不错
Yeah. So, very nice.

251
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,710
房租多少
What's the damage?

252
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,480
1200美金一个月
1,200 a month.

253
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,350
我仔细调查了周围的社区环境
I did a lot of researching for this neighborhood.

254
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,710
挺划算的
It's a pretty good deal.

255
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,840
开玩笑呢  简直是超划算啊
You kidding me? That's a great deal.

256
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,380
说到这个
Uh, speaking of which, ahem.

257
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,570
这是这周的
That's for the week,

258
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,110
考虑到搬家可能遇到的麻烦
plus there's a little extra in there

259
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,410
还稍微多加了一些
for any move-related incidentals.

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,610
谢谢
Thank you.

261
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,740
小伙子  新学校怎么样
Hey, champ, how's the new school?

262
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,400
不错
Good.

263
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,740
我在你那个年纪时很喜欢学校
I loved school when I was your age.

264
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,610
跷跷板  故事时间
Seesaws, story time,

265
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,170
拿着棒子追小姑娘
chasing girls with sticks.

266
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,470
直到五年级
It wasn't until the fifth grade

267
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,100
我才发现她也喜欢我
that I found out she liked me, too.

268
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,480
可那时她家已经搬到斯克代尔去了
But by then her family had moved to Scottsdale,

269
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,570
所以就
so...

270
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
及时行乐  记住了么
carpe diem, okay?

271
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
好的
Okay.

272
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,210
好小子  哈
All right, good boy. Ha!

273
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,670
请你再替我们俩感谢一下杰西
So, um, you'll thank Jesse again from both of us.

274
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,840
没问题
You got it.

275
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,450
他现在怎么样了
So is he-- How's he doing?

276
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,440
杰西
Jesse?

277
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,670
他很好
He's good.

278
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,380
他很忙
He's, uh... he's busy.

279
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,810
房子怎么样
How is it?

280
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,810
空间很大  灯很多
Oh, there's space, lots of light.

281
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,610
后面还带个小花园  很不错
It's-- A little garden out back. It's nice.

282
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,020
布鲁克他怎样
And Brock? How's he doing?

283
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,670
听着  每周都这样像艾德・麦克马洪
Hey, look, I don't mind dropping checks off

284
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,960
一样扔下支票就走  我真的是一点都不介意
every week like Ed McMahon.

285
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,590
可是如果你真的想知道他们怎样了
But if you really want to know how they're doing,

286
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,960
为什么不自己去看看
why don't you go see for yourself?

287
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,790
我等下来找你们
I'll catch you later.

288
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,760
要不要我送你回家
Hey, you going to need a ride home?

289
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
不用
No.

290
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,310
真棒
Great.

291
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,810
不管怎样  我很自豪我没有失去冷静
Anyway, I'm proud for not losing my cool.

292
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,210
另外我还向洗车员工表现了
Plus it shows our wipe-down crew

293
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,610
若是顾客太过粗鲁
that I will support them

294
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,760
我是会支持他们的
if a customer is being really rude to them.

295
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,260
你对洗车店老板这个角色还真是投入啊
You're really taking to this whole be your own boss thing.

296
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,960
是啊  是有点
Yeah. I guess I am.

297
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,390
实际上
Actually,

298
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,820
我正打算升职到管理层
I'm thinking about making a move up to management.

299
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,220
-嗯  -老天啊
- Mmm. - Ah, Jesus.

300
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,530
美国公司们小心了
Corporate America, look out.

301
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,760
真对不起了
Oh, excuse me.

302
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,590
这将是我的一次重大提升
I would be a vast improvement.

303
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,520
克莱曼医院没有一个管理部分的人
No one in Kleinman's entire front office

304
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,720
知道做X光检查应该先做什么
knows the first thing about giving an X-ray,

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,490
但这只是
which just-- ahh.

306
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,490
爸爸  扫描的结果怎么样
Hey, Dad, uh, whatever happened with your scan?

307
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,760
报告拿回来了吗
Did-- Did you get the results back?

308
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,090
是啊  拿回来了
Yeah. I did.

309
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,530
我的症状仍在减轻中
And I'm still in remission.

310
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,590
所以你们还得忍我一阵子了
So you're all going to have to be stuck with me for a while longer.

311
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,060
恭喜了  伙计
Cheers, buddy.

312
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,090
你怎么样了  汉克
What about you, Hank?

313
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,590
这几天感觉怎么样
How you feeling these days?

314
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,760
不错  越来越好了
Well, I'm getting there.

315
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,760
前两天  他又和毒品管制局那帮人
The other day, he had a big powwow

316
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,760
聚在一起捣鬼了
with all the DEA muckity-mucks.

317
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,160
出什么事了
What was that about?

318
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,320
没什么  又是一条死胡同
Nothing. Just a dead end.

319
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,490
他也不肯跟我说
He won't tell me, either.

320
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,620
显然  这属于绝密级别
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

321
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,160
沃尔特  能帮我个忙吗
Hey, Walt, can you do me a favor?

322
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,080
玛丽明天要工作
Uh, Marie's working tomorrow,

323
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,230
而明天市集那边
and there's this gem and mineral show

324
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,290
有个宝矿石展览
that's opening at the fairgrounds.

325
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,990
能不能请你送我去
I wondered if you can maybe give me a lift.

326
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,090
当然了
Yeah. Sure.

327
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,760
高中时我也收集过矿石
I had a collection of my own back in high school.

328
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
没什么特别值钱的
I mean, nothing fancy.

329
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,690
只是入门级别的绿玉石和石榴石
Just entry-level beryls and garnets,

330
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,430
一块还可以的黑色电气石
one passable black tourmaline.

331
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,750
-这里右拐  -好的
- Turn right here. - Okay.

332
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,220
但是我有一块铯绿柱石
But I did have one piece of morganite

333
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,490
非常特别
that was very special.

334
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,660
它曾经被加热过
It had been heat treated,

335
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,920
所有有那种经典的反光效果
so it had that classic cast to it,

336
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,220
那种玫瑰色  近乎鲑鱼肉色  知道吗
that rose, almost salmon hue, you know?

337
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,660
喂  沃尔特  根本没有什么矿石展  懂么
Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay?

338
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,990
我只是不想吓到玛丽
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.

339
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,220
这里右拐
Take a right here.

340
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,720
有什么吓人的
Freak about what?

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
汉克  我们去哪里
Hank, where are we going?

342
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,260
你饿了?
You hungry?

343
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,490
我们不是来买炸鸡的
We're not here for the chicken.

344
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,590
关掉引擎
Kill the engine.

345
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,530
好了  呵呵呵
All right, heh heh heh.

346
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,460
准备来点刺激的了么
You ready for your mind to be blown?

347
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,690
当然了
Uh, sure.

348
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,160
古斯塔沃・福林
Gustavo Fring.

349
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,920
记得他么
Remember him?

350
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,990
枪击案发生后他来过医院
He came down to the hospital after the shooting

351
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,790
跑来劳军的
and put up the reward?

352
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,090
他每年都赞助毒品管制局的募捐长跑
He-- He-- He sponsors the DEA Fun Run every year.

353
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,490
你见过他的
You-- You've met him.

354
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,890
对  募捐长跑那个人
Yeah, the-- the Fun Run guy.

355
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,390
对  对  那个人
Yeah, that-- that guy--

356
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,490
是啊  他怎么了
Yeah. What about him?

357
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,390
我怀疑
Well, I suspect--

358
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,020
尽管无法证明  但是我怀疑
and I can't prove it, mind you, but I suspect...

359
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,810
这人是个大毒枭
the man's a drug dealer.

360
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,790
是啊  卖甲基苯丙胺的
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

361
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,260
说实话  我真心认为
I mean, honest to God, I really believe

362
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,060
这人或许是西南部最大的毒枭之一
that this guy's maybe one of the biggest movers in the southwest.

363
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,560
还记得盖尔・伯蒂彻么
Remember Gale Boetticher?

364
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,890
卡拉OK录像带上那个傻瓜
The, uh, that sad sack from the karaoke video tape?

365
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,990
对
Yeah.

366
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,990
你还说  那人的水平并不令你感到吃惊
And you said that he didn't strike you

367
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,410
是当头儿的类型
as being the boss-man type,

368
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,720
很可能背后还有条大鱼
that probably there was a much bigger guy out there, right?

369
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,010
汉克  那
Hank, that was--

370
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,069
那只是推测
that was just speculation.

371
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,060
没关系  它让我留心调查此事
Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

372
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,160
猜我发现了什么
And guess what I find.

373
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,809
伯蒂彻被杀现场
Chicken man's fingerprints

374
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,290
发现了炸鸡店老板的指纹
at Boetticher's murder scene.

375
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,600
于是我们把他叫来问话
So we bring him in--

376
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,390
你认为  古斯塔沃・福林杀了盖尔・伯蒂彻
You think that-- that Gustavo Fring killed Gale Boetticher?

377
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,620
也许不是
Well, probably not.

378
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,850
我是说  他们这些人
I mean, these guys use, you know,

379
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,760
都会让手下动手
like, a dunce to pull the trigger, right?

380
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,909
但是他的现场指纹
But his fingerprints being there was enough

381
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,180
已足够我们找他问话了
for us to bring him in.

382
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,430
你把他带到警局去了
So I-- So you brought him in to the police?

383
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,160
是啊  他坐下跟我们对话
Right. He sits down to talk with us.

384
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,160
问题是他...
The problem is that he--

385
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,400
你问他什么了  他说了什么
What did you ask him? What did he say?

386
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,530
你能让我把话说完吗
Walt, will you let me finish my story here?

387
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,260
抱歉  我只是很感兴趣
Sorry. I'm just, uh, interested.

388
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,990
-如此而已  -明白
- You know. - Yeah, all right.

389
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,190
我们请他过来
So we bring him in,

390
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,760
他对答如流
and he proceeds to kick our asses, okay?

391
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,190
他解释了指纹的事
He's got an explanation for the fingerprints, right?

392
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,620
也有盖尔被杀当晚的不在场证明
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.

393
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,430
他理由充足得很
I mean, he's got reasons for everything.

394
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,220
这家伙简直比《母女情深》还有说服力
This guy is Terms of Endearment convincing.

395
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,220
<font color="HEDEBE8"><i>80年代美国热映亲情片

396
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,920
那他是清白的
So he's not guilty?

397
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,490
就目前毒品管制局和警方看来
Well, as far as DEA and APD are concerned,

398
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,509
他还没有脱离嫌疑
he's not.

399
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,860
但他还没有正式成为嫌疑人
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

400
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,220
但是我给你讲
But I'm telling you,

401
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,530
我的直觉告诉我他就是我要找的人
something deep down says he's my guy.

402
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,190
只是仍需证据
Just got to prove it.

403
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,220
汉克  你为何跟我说这个
Hank, why-- why are you telling me this?

404
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,320
我需要帮忙
I need a favor.

405
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,220
帮什么忙
What favor?

406
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,190
看见那辆沃尔沃休旅车了吗
See that Volvo station wagon over there?

407
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,790
那家伙开了一辆十年前的沃尔沃旧款
I mean, the guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo.

408
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,020
真聪明  总之
It's brilliant. Anyway, listen.

409
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,660
我需要你帮我
What I need for you to do...

410
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,530
把这个安在上面
stick this on it.

411
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,320
定位跟踪装置
GPS tracker.

412
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,190
妻子总是怀疑丈夫在外面鬼混
You know, wifey thinks hubby's screwing around on her,

413
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,020
就会想要查清楚
but she wants to be sure. Hmm.

414
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,290
你把这个安在车上
You stick this on the car.

415
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,380
这里看见了吗  是块磁铁
This part right here? It's a magnet.

416
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,320
然后就能知道他的去向
And see where he goes.

417
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,590
太绝了  对吧
Cool, huh?

418
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,510
天空购网上买的  289块
289 from SkyMall.

419
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,090
可惜的是  这不是实时的
Unfortunately, it's not live use,

420
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,960
我们之后还得回来
so we got to come back later and, you know,

421
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,920
把它取下来  插进电脑里看
take it off and stick it in the computer.

422
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,020
不过这已经很先进了
Still, pretty amazing times we live in here.

423
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,660
汉克  这不是违法的吗
Hank, isn't that illegal?

424
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,220
这算不算非法调查...
I mean, isn't there some sort of unlawful search and--

425
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,060
这叫做法外调查
That's, uh, known as extra-legal,

426
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,160
但是相信我吧  你知我知
but trust me. It's our little secret.

427
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,390
很容易的  好吗  你这么办
Look, it's easy, okay? Here's what you do.

428
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,290
把鞋带解开
You untie your shoelace,

429
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,020
朝餐厅走去
then you head toward the restaurant.

430
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,020
经过那辆车的时候
As you're walking past the car,

431
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,190
你低头一看  "该死  鞋带松了"
you look down-- "Oh, hey, darn, my shoe's untied."

432
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
好吗
Okay?

433
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,270
接着  趁你
Now, when you-- when you--

434
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,430
弯下腰系鞋带之时
when you bend down to tie your shoe,

435
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,720
就把这个塞进轮胎的轮窝里
you, uh, you stick this up into the wheel well.

436
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,390
然后你就大方走进去  买点什么
Then you go inside and, I don't know--

437
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,560
汉克  我不...
Hank, I-- I don't--

438
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,220
我觉得这事不太靠谱
I don't feel good about this at all.

439
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
沃特  我知道
Look, Walt, I-- I-- I know

440
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,180
这种事超出你平常所为
that this sort of thing is outside your comfort zone--

441
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,890
不  我是说这是错误的
No. I mean this is a mistake.

442
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,100
沃特  我需要你帮我  好吗
Walt, I need you to help me out here, okay?

443
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,460
这对我真的很重要
I mean, this is really important to me.

444
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,990
天啊  你要我哀求你吗
Jesus, just-- You make me beg you?

445
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,290
就把它塞进去就行了
Come on, just stick it in there.

446
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,790
好吧
Yeah.

447
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,020
自然一点
Just act normal.

448
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,690
需要点餐吗
May I help you?

449
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,960
我  我
I-- I--

450
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,440
先生  需要点餐吗
Sir, may I help you?

451
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,860
瞧
Look, I--

452
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
我没那么做
I didn't do it.

453
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,290
看见了吗  我没下手
See? I didn't do it.

454
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,820
做
Do it.

455
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,990
下手
Do it.

456
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,820
您需要点餐吗
May I help you with your order?

457
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,090
我
I, uh--

458
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,720
他究竟在干嘛
What the hell is he--

459
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,760
确保它塞牢了
Just, uh, made sure it was secure.

460
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,230
我的汽水呢
Where's my soda?

461
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,220
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

462
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,920
我们走吧
Let's-- Let's go.

463
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,890
瞧  我
Look, I--

464
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,980
我向天发誓  我本以为是要载他
I swear to God I thought I was driving the man

465
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,630
去看矿藏展
to a gem and mineral show.

466
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,960
可他突然让我转向去了你的餐馆
And all of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant

467
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,670
告诉我  他在调查你
and-- and-- and telling me that he's investigating you.

468
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,909
虽然你我之间有小摩擦
Look, you and I, we've had our differences,

469
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,430
但我绝不会...
but I would never--

470
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,870
我妹夫
Look, m-my brother-in-law,

471
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,910
显然没有任何证据
evidence-wise, has nothing.

472
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,230
他只是臆测而为
He's-- He's operating on pure conjecture,

473
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,410
每个人  和他共事的所有人
and no one-- not one person that he works with--

474
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,900
都认为你只是
thinks that you are anyone

475
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,000
一家快餐连锁的业主而已
other than an owner of a fast food chain.

476
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,400
但如果汉克遭遇不测
But if something were to happen to Hank,

477
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,070
那只会引来他们对你的注意
then that would only draw their attention to you

478
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,300
也会让我成为目标
and therefore to me as well.

479
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,900
因此我们都有不用武力解决的需要
So we have a mutual interest in resolving this without violence.

480
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,370
我可以确保他一无所获
I will make sure that he discovers nothing.

481
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,770
杰西
Jesse!

482
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,270
怎么了
What?

483
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,500
对  都不等我请你进来
All right. Don't wait to be, like, invited.

484
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,710
家里还有人吗
Are we alone?

485
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,610
进行到哪一步了
So where do we stand?

486
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,210
什么到哪一步了
Where do we stand on what?

487
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,040
我们的计划到哪一步了
Where do we stand with the thing?

488
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,050
你本该实施的计划
The thing that you were supposed to do.

489
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,300
我猜你没去做
I assume you haven't done it.

490
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,580
你不是丢了  对吧
You didn't lose it, did you?

491
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,560
你要是丢了会告诉我的  对吧
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

492
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,270
杰西
Oh, Jesus.

493
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,450
混蛋
Asshole.

494
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,889
你这么上赶  你自己去做吧
You creaming to get it done? Go do it yourself.

495
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,310
要是他没发现我...
If he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of--

496
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,980
算了
This-- All right, look.

497
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,080
我们得抓紧时间了
Our timetable has advanced.

498
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,140
你得这周就安排好会面
You have got to make this meeting happen

499
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,250
明天  有可能的话  今晚
this week, tomorrow-- tonight, if possible.

500
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,110
今晚  真行
Oh. Tonight. Wow.

501
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,780
你这是嗑药了吗
What are you, high?

502
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,080
我妹夫
My brother-in-law--

503
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,280
我那个当毒品管制局探员的妹夫
My DEA agent brother-in-law--

504
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,480
他查到古斯了
He's on to Gus.

505
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,510
你听见我说什么了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

506
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,410
我妹夫在查古斯
My brother-in-law is on to Gus.

507
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,650
是啊是啊  我听见了
Ah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

508
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,090
你妹夫对吧  我在考虑呢
Your brother-in-law, okay? I'm thinking.

509
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,460
这
Look, uh,

510
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,340
要是这就像是在做数学题  代数题呢
so what if this is like math or algebra?

511
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,810
一个正麻烦  加一个负麻烦
You add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag

512
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,510
等于麻烦归零
and you get, like, zero douche bags.

513
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,710
我来教你怎么做数学
I've got some math for you.

514
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,160
汉克抓到古斯  等于汉克抓到我们
Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us.

515
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,210
汉克这人
Hank-- Geez.

516
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,910
不屈不挠的
He's relentless, all right?

517
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,410
他不会放弃的
He won't quit.

518
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,710
好吧  我要说的是  他什么也查不到
Yeah, well, he's got nothing is all I can say.

519
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,180
你怎么会知道
Oh, and how would you know that?

520
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,180
因为他在明处
Because he's still above ground.

521
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,140
你觉得像古斯这样的人  会让人
You think a dude like Gus would let your boy

522
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,410
轻易查到他吗
anywhere near him?

523
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,180
他会用他的工具刀好好对付那个残废
He'll break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass.

524
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:07,510
那次晚餐之后  你再也没有见过他吗
So you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner.

525
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,610
好了  不说了
Okay. Shh.

526
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,350
好好想想  好吧
Think. All right.

527
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,580
他们会知道我们交谈过
Um, they've got to be figuring that we've talked,

528
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,510
所以你要告诉麦克
so you need to tell Mike

529
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,350
你很担心汉克的追查
that you are worried about Hank's investigation.

530
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,680
另外汉克已经知道到你的身份了
Okay? Hank already knows who you are, by the way.

531
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,580
再说  你是杀了盖尔的真凶
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,

532
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,940
所以就以此为由
so there's that.

533
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,880
这是你要求与古斯面谈的
This is all good fodder

534
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,080
最好的借口
for you to request a sit-down with Gus

535
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,740
说你要讨论一下  万一汉克找你去问话
so you can discuss what you would say

536
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,940
你该怎么回答
in case Hank brings you in for questioning.

537
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,280
好吗  现在你
Okay? Now you just--

538
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,250
你就说你想
you just say that you want to be--

539
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,200
不  说你需要
no, that-- that you need

540
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,500
对好口供
to be able to be properly coached,

541
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,820
等你接近他
and when you're near him--

542
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,630
你就用这个
you put this to use.

543
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,480
他只会告诉我
He's just going to tell me

544
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,980
要是被抓  就把嘴闭紧
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

545
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,450
他不会安排会面的
He ain't going to set up no meeting.

546
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,710
那你就坚持要求  该死
Well, then insist on it, damn it!

547
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
表现得很慌张
Act panicked.

548
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,810
古斯现在坐如针毡
Gus' ass is on the line,

549
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,480
相信我  如果你觉得你牵连其中
And trust me. He will meet with you

550
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,760
他会跟你见面的
if he thinks that you're a liability.

551
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,422
不  他如果觉得我牵连其中
No, he will waste me

552
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:19,980
他只会杀了我
if he thinks I'm a liability.

553
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,310
无所谓了  伙计
You know what? Whatever, man.

554
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,980
我要去撒尿
I'm going to take a piss.

555
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,310
<i>见面取消 出了点事 老板很忙

556
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,460
你刚才有电话
Uh, I think you got a phone call.

557
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,460
有什么要紧事吗
Anything important?

558
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,830
你好
Yes?

559
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,630
我探了探风声
I did some digging around.

560
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,730
如何
And?

561
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,809
毒品管制局和警方
Neither the DEA nor the APD

562
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,610
都没有把你列为怀疑对象
considers you a person of interest.

563
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,380
施拉德在擅自调查你
Schrader's looking into you totally on his lonesome.

564
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,420
孤立无援
A voice in the wilderness.

565
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,870
有人力物力吗
Does he have resources?

566
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,590
就他自己和他的信用卡
Just him, his credit card,

567
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,050
还有他的司机沃尔特
and his chauffeur Walter.

568
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,800
据传闻  如果他再向默克特提起你
From what I hear, he would be committing career suicide

569
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,050
他的饭碗就保不住了
if he were to mention you to Merkert again.

570
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,530
所以说他没有在我车上安追踪器的令
So no warrant for the tracking device on my car.

571
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,370
对  他太特立独行了
No. The guy's gone totally maverick.

572
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,400
他是妙女神探
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

573
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,709
我们处处小心  别被他抓到马脚
We watch our backs, make sure we don't throw him any bones,

574
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,040
他就无机可趁了
he'll never make a case.

575
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,909
那智利的事呢
What about Chile?

576
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,509
连我都查不到你1989年前的资料
If I can't find any trace of you before '89,

577
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,800
施拉德就更难找到了
I seriously doubt Schrader can.

578
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,870
我看更让人头疼的是卡特尔集团
Seems to me the bigger problem's the cartel.

579
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,770
如果他挖掘不到进一步的信息  我们就能应付
We can handle them if that's all we've got on our plate.

580
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,209
不过同时应付施拉德
But dealing with both Schrader

581
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,840
和那帮墨西哥人
and the Mexicans at the same time,

582
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,800
如果他们采取行动时  他正在监视
if he happens to be watching when they make a move,

583
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,670
那事态就不可控制了
they could be the perfect storm.

584
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,210
谢谢
Thank you.

585
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,140
保持联系
I'll be in touch.

586
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,740
你好  赫克托
Hello, Hector.

587
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,170
卡特尔集团给我下了最后通牒
The cartel has given me its ultimatum,

588
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,940
不过我拒绝了
to which I've said no.

589
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,670
毒品管制局的探员施拉德
DEA agent Schrader--

590
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,870
他是个大麻烦
uh, he's a concern.

591
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,900
他在查我的老底
He's looking into my past.

592
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,740
是今天吗  赫克托
Is today the day, Hector?

593
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,660
-古斯塔沃  坐下  你搞得我好紧张  -好

594
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,990
这计划很好  相信好

595
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,990
一切都会顺利的

596
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,660
你疯了吗

597
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,020
老大会把你的蛋给割了

598
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,630
怎么  你要打小报告吗

599
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,810
你们呢

600
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,410
他们是不会说的

601
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,830
他们喜欢这样

602
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,740
你不给我们的客人倒点喝的吗

603
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,360
谁说他们是客人

604
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,260
老板让他们喝

605
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,880
他们才能喝

606
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,180
那么  炸鸡兄弟

607
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,890
我喜欢你们的餐馆

608
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,560
-很高兴你能喜欢  谢谢  -谢谢

609
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,030
黑皮肤和白皮肤

610
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,820
我看不像兄弟

611
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,620
终于见面了

612
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,310
主厨们

613
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,090
你们俩

614
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,170
你们烹制的鸡肉

615
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,050
我发誓  一定是全墨西哥最好吃的鸡肉

616
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,760
谢谢  爱兰迪奥先生

617
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,510
非常荣幸

618
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,970
麦克斯是主厨

619
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,800
全是他的功劳

620
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,560
古斯塔沃太谦虚了

621
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,640
没有他  这餐馆根本开不了

622
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,110
不管你们怎么做到的  继续加油

623
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,610
你们的鸡肉  很带劲

624
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,940
很辛辣

625
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,110
不过不像墨西哥的风味

626
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,220
这是从智利学来的食谱

627
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,410
为了迎合墨西哥人的口味  我们稍作了修改

628
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,330
我打赌  我们比你们智利人更喜欢智利口味

629
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,340
我们墨西哥人喜欢重口味

630
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,810
那么  如果你的搭档负责烹饪

631
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,310
那你又是干什么的

632
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,850
别告诉我你只是个美食家

633
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,500
我负责商业运作

634
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,440
古斯塔沃是个很出色的商人

635
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,660
他是个商人啊

636
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,280
很好  很好

637
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,620
告诉我

638
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,500
那鸡肉  那么好吃

639
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,460
无与伦比

640
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,290
除了那个  你们的菜单里还加了什么

641
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,800
我们有几道配餐

642
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,010
米饭

643
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,090
豆子

644
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,890
如果我们在市场上看到新鲜牛肉

645
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,890
有时我们会准备些墨西哥特制牛肉

646
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,210
还有吗

647
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,940
坦白说吧

648
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,860
你们就没别的了吗  有点味道的其它东西

649
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,780
其它辅料

650
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,870
因为我的手下去你们餐馆

651
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,120
带回来的可不止鸡肉

652
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,910
他们带回了毒品

653
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,170
你们贩毒给他们

654
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,470
冰毒

655
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,640
恕我冒犯  爱兰迪奥先生

656
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,350
我没贩毒给他们

657
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,270
我给的是样品

658
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,640
样品

659
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,030
生意人

660
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,820
我把样品给他们  让他们转交给你

661
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,030
让你看看我们的货

662
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,370
爱兰迪奥先生  古斯塔沃没想冒犯你

663
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,600
可他...  那话的意思是...

664
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,870
我们没别的办法吸引你的注意

665
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,080
我们想和你合作  爱兰迪奥先生

666
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,840
我对冰毒了解得一清二楚

667
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,590
那是穷人的可卡因

668
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,480
只有低收入的人才吸那个

669
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,520
这没赚头

670
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,440
爱兰迪奥先生  我插几句...

671
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,820
我是个受过专业培训的生化学家

672
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,530
我们制造的冰毒

673
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,070
要比你所说的穷人所知道的更高级

674
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,030
这是晶体  像玻璃一样

675
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,370
纯度更高

676
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,080
还有分子的偏光力

677
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,500
分子的结构  是不同的

678
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,710
药效要强得多

679
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,010
这货很有前景

680
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,920
能够让你的利润乘上三倍

681
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,220
或许能上四倍

682
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,220
他们不只是出色的厨师

683
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,310
还很擅长铲肥料

684
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,750
不  不  继续  继续

685
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,750
现在  你几乎只卖可卡因

686
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,990
可古柯植物无法在墨西哥生长

687
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,370
你无非是个中间商

688
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,410
卖方还是哥伦比亚人

689
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,220
他们扣掉走私的利润

690
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,340
尽管你一直在铤而走险

691
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,330
可巨额利润还是他们的

692
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,180
这个新的晶体冰毒

693
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,140
效力更强  比可卡因更容易上瘾

694
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,690
这样就会有更大的需求量

695
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,900
最重要的是  这完全是人工制造的

696
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,740
我们可以给你看制造过程  就在墨西哥

697
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
而你能获得全部的利润

698
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,950
我手下很喜欢你们的产品

699
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,630
赫克托  你怎么回事

700
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,130
怎么不给客人拿杯子

701
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,220
你们继续

702
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,430
你们太有才了

703
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,490
我打赌你们是从妈妈那里学来的厨艺  对吗

704
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,490
可化学呢

705
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,780
是我在智利的圣地亚哥大学学的

706
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,240
古斯塔沃为我付的学费

707
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,450
是吗

708
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,370
我有生化学和化学工程的双学位

709
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,000
用最小的资本投资

710
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,710
我们能为你建造工厂级的实验室

711
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,220
培训你的手下制造大量的

712
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,050
高纯度冰毒

713
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,400
真不错

714
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,930
但告诉我一件事

715
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,650
如果你是厨子

716
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,010
我还要他干什么

717
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,110
我不懂

718
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,500
你

719
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,300
为什么我要和一个对我不敬的人谈判

720
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,890
未经我的允许  在我眼皮底下贩毒

721
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,940
还设局让我来见面

722
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,540
就在我手下的面前

723
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,940
我要你干什么

724
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,780
爱兰迪奥先生  求你了

725
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,490
我什么都没卖

726
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,910
如果因为我争取了这次见面

727
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,250
而冒犯了你  我道歉

728
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,830
我很少采取主动

729
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:12,840
我没有侮辱你的意思

730
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,220
爱兰迪奥先生  古斯塔沃没想冒犯你

731
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,140
我对古斯塔沃的了解如同对兄弟一样

732
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,640
他是个可敬的人

733
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,430
是我认识的最忠诚的人

734
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,020
他把我从圣地亚哥的贫民窟解救出来

735
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,730
是他成就了今天的我

736
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,650
古斯塔沃是个天才  他能让你家财万贯

737
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,360
请打心眼里原谅他这小错误吧

738
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,110
求你了

739
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,030
他是我的搭档

740
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,360
我需要他

741
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,120
我对天发誓

742
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,490
看着他

743
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,200
是你害的

744
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,240
看着他

745
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,550
给我听着

746
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,880
你活着  而他死了的唯一原因

747
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,350
就是因为我知道你的底细

748
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,260
可你要清楚

749
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,900
你已经不在智利了

750
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,490
我建议

751
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,830
专心做你的炸鸡

752
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,950
看着我  赫克托
Look at me, Hector.

753
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,820
看着我
Look... at... me.

754
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,790
还是下次吧
Maybe next time.
