1
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,027
我就开门见山直说了
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,075
这里  化学  是我的领域
This, the Chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,068
制毒的事归我管
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,004
出了这里  外面的事由你处理
Out there on the street, you deal with that.

5
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,014
至于我们那些客户的事  
As far as our customers go,

6
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:08,094
我一点都不想知道
I don't wanna know anything about them

7
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,026
我不想见到他们  
I don't want to see them.

8
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,063
也不想听到他们的消息
I don't want to hear from them.

9
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:14,062
无论如何  我不想跟他们有任何接触
I want no interaction with them whatsoever.

10
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,053
整个行动就你我两人  
This operation is you and me,

11
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:22,028
而我负责幕后的
and I'm the silent partner.

12
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,045
这样安排  你有问题吗
You got any issues with that?

13
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,015
管他什么呢  老兄
Whatever, man.

14
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:35,059
不管发生什么事
No matter what happens,

15
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,089
不能再有流血事件
No more bloodshed.

16
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,059
不能再用暴力
No violence.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,050
绝

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,050
命

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,050
毒

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,050
师

-你还好吧  -嗯  没事
- You all right? - Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,015
我很好
Yeah. I'm okay.

33
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:45,031
亲爱的  你真的不必...
You know, honey, you really don't have to...

34
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,030
我喜欢呆在这儿陪你
Look, I like being here with you.

35
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,059
我只是说
I'm only saying that,

36
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:59,003
你想先走的话  我一个人没事的  真的
I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go.

37
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:03,077
事实上  如果我知道
You know, actually, it would make me

38
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:06,016
小沃尔特放学回家的时候
Feel a little better knowing that you were there

39
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:09,008
你能在那陪着他  会让我更好受些  
When Walter Jr. gets home from school.

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,071
好吧
Okay.

41
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,080
-你好了就给我打电话吧  -我会的
- You'll call me when you're finished? - Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,042
你跟埃米利奥联系过了吗
And have you been in touch with Elliott?

43
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:30,009
因为我还没收到他开来的支票
Because I haven't seen a check from him.

44
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,009
是的  在我这里
Yes, I got it.

45
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:34,055
-真的  -支票到了  是的
- Really? - It came, yeah.

46
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,048
是的  上周就到了
Yeah, it came last week,

47
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:41,052
我存进我信用合作社的账户里了  所以
And I put it right into my credit union account, so...

48
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,041
我处理好了
Taken care of it.

49
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,063
很好
Good.

50
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,081
所以说一切都好  一切都好
So we're good. We're good.

51
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:58,060
周一前先别兑现这张支票  好吗
Could you not deposit this until Monday?

52
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:01,048
谢谢
Thank you.

53
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,069
如有不适  请及时致电
Call if the discomfort's too much.

54
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,097
不然的话  我们下周再见
Otherwise, we'll see you next week.

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,017
好的
Yeah.

56
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:33,070
化学反应包含两方面的变化
Chemical reactions involve change on two levels:

57
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:36,002
物质的和能量上的
Matter and energy.

58
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,039
反应逐步发生的时候
When a reaction is gradual,

59
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,009
能量上的变化相当微弱
The change in energy is slight.

60
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,040
你甚至都不会意识到反应的发生
I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening.

61
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,081
比方说
For example,

62
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:52,034
汽车底盘逐步生锈的过程
When rust collects on the underside of a car.

63
00:04:56,076 --> 00:05:00,090
但是如果反应迅速发生
But if a reaction happens quickly,

64
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:05,063
无害物质则会以某种方式相互作用
Otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way

65
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:09,042
产生出巨大的能量
That generates enormous bursts of energy.

66
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,026
谁能举个例子来  
Who can give me an example

67
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,063
关于快速化学反应
of rapid chemical reaction?

68
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:27,054
提示一下  看看这里
Hint, Hint. Right here.

69
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:30,004
比方说  爆炸
Like an explosion?

70
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,093
是的  很好
Yes. Good.

71
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,010
爆炸
Explosions.

72
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,096
爆炸就是由化学反应所致
Explosions are the result of chemical reactions

73
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:41,087
它几乎在一瞬间发生
Happening almost instantaneously.

74
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:45,018
爆炸物相互反应的速度越快
And the faster reactants, i.e., explosives,

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,025
他们发生变化的速度越快
And fulminative mercury is a prime example of that,

76
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,081
爆炸产生的威力就越大
The faster they undergo change,

77
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,039
雷酸汞就是个最佳的例子
The more violent the explosion.

78
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,034
所以说  爆炸
So... explosions.

79
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:05,045
好了  大家先从第七章开头
Okay, listen. Why don't you start reading on your own

80
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:08,078
自己看起来  好吗
From the top of chapter 7,all right?

81
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,076
你还好吧
You okay?

82
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:28,002
我都知道了  怀特先生
I got it, Mr. White.

83
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,071
别太担心了
Don't worry.

84
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,097
你还有这些孩子要教
You got kids to teach.

85
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:54,028
谢谢你  雨果
Thanks, Hugo.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,034
他开始日渐消瘦
He's starting to lose weight,

87
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,074
让人看着...
Which is tough...

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,060
心里难受
To see that.

89
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,003
当我拥抱他时  
You know, to feel the difference

90
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:18,059
明显感觉到他的变化
when I put my arms around him.

91
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:29,009
-我能跟他说几句吗  -当然
- Can I talk to him? - Of course.

92
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,032
沃尔特
Walt...

93
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,028
当你不再对我敞开心扉
When you don't let me in

94
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:38,014
当你不再对我倾述出了什么事
When you don't tell me what's going on,

95
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,051
有时候  我觉得就好像
I think it's like I feel like

96
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,069
你甚至都不想让我陪在你身边
You don't even want me around sometimes.

97
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,047
我没有
No.

98
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,085
还有  最近这些天
And recently these afternoons,

99
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:51,006
你每天下午都这么晚回家
When you're coming home so late

100
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:53,048
我们就只能呆在家里  不断想着
And we're just left wondering

101
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,035
你到底去哪了
Where you are.

102
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,089
是的  爸爸
Yeah, Dad.

103
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,058
到底怎么回事
What's up with that?

104
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,021
沃尔特  你还有什么事
Walt, is there anything else

105
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,069
瞒着家里的吗
You're holding back from your family?

106
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:14,028
是时候说出来了
Now's the time to share.

107
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:24,062
有时候  
I like to be alone,

108
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,014
我就想一个人静一下
I mean at times,

109
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,097
不是针对你们  真的
And it's not about you, really.

110
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,085
只是  有的时候  什么话都不说
It's just that sometimes it feels better

111
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:37,068
就一个人静静地呆一会
Not to talk at all...

112
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:43,073
会让我更好受些
About anything, to anyone.

113
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:46,060
独处  对某些人来说确实会有帮助
Alone time can be helpful for some types.

114
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:52,008
也许  让你的家人知道
Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone

115
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,022
你独处时都在干嘛  
Might make it easier for your family

116
00:08:55,022 --> 00:09:00,012
会让他们更容易理解 也更容易接受
To be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.

117
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:09,003
我喜欢下班后散散步
I like to go on walks

118
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:13,072
一周两次  或者更多
A couple of times a week,maybe more, after work,

119
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:19,038
我很享受亲近自然
And I really enjoy the nature.

120
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:23,010
仙人掌
You know, the cacti,

121
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,090
植被之类的
The vegetation, that kind of thing.

122
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,075
这对治疗很有帮助
It's really very therapeutic.

123
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,011
你没事吧
Yo! You okay?

124
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:09,025
-你吸了那个啥了吗  -没  有点晕而已
- Did you breathe that shit? - No. I'm just dizzy.

125
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,005
起来
Come here.

126
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,006
-坐下  坐下  -热死我了
- Sit down, sit down. - I'm burning up.

127
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,042
把这个脱了吧
Take this off.

128
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,015
坐下  透口气
Sit down. Get some air.

129
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,080
天呐
Oh. God.

130
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,000
就这样  好多了
Yeah, that's better.

131
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,027
你打算什么时候告诉我
When were you going to tell me?

132
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,037
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

133
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,026
癌症
Cancer.

134
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,073
你得了癌症  对吗
You got it, right?

135
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:59,014
你怎么知道
How did you know?

136
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,066
我姑妈身上也有这种斑点
My aunt had one of those dots on her,

137
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:05,017
化疗时作指引用的
To target the radiation.

138
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:07,010
是肺癌吗
What is it, in your lung?

139
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:10,095
我是你的搭档  你应该跟我说实话
I'm your partner, man. You should have told me.

140
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,068
这个可不酷  一点都不
That's not cool, okay?  Not at all.

141
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,041
到什么阶段了
What stage are you?

142
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,016
中晚期了
3a.

143
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:26,057
已经扩散到淋巴系统了
Gone to your lymph nodes.

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,015
你姑妈
Your aunt.

145
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,068
她查出来的时候到什么程度了
How bad was she when they caught it?

146
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:47,002
很糟糕  她没撑多久
Bad enough. She didn't last long.

147
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,038
多久
How long?

148
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:52,025
7个月
Seven months.

149
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,011
我终于明白了
I get it now.

150
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,062
原来你做这些是因为这个
That's why you're doing all this.

151
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,013
你想在临死前为家人留些钱
You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.

152
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,029
-有什么意见吗  -你说呢
- You got a problem with that? - You tell me.

153
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,000
你才像是从微波炉里爬出来的
You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave.

154
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:20,059
你能搞定这批货吗
You going to be able to finish the batch?

155
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,036
是的
Yes.

156
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,052
好吧
All right.

157
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,066
不行
No.

158
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,086
你来吧
You do it.

159
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,045
我
Me?

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,010
是的
Yeah.

161
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:42,027
你那些疯狂的绝活都哪儿去了
What happened to your mad skills?

162
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,059
这个  接着
Go on. Here.

163
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,053
你来做
You do it.

164
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,059
你能行的
You can do it.

165
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,084
有什么问题的话  我就在外面  
If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.

166
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:14,043
下次化疗时  在头上放个冰袋
The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo.

167
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,053
我姑妈说可以防止脱发
My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.

168
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:58,013
这是什么  圣诞礼物吗
What's this? Christmas?

169
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:04,046
这是我们在郊区制毒窝点发现的那个吗
This the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook site?

170
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,000
-该死  -怎么了
- Holy shit. - What?

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,064
实验室发现里面有残留的陈旧字迹
Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing

172
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:15,033
是马克笔之类的东西写上去的
That used to be on the inside. Old Magic Marker or something.

173
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,076
是吗  写什么了
Yeah? What's it say?

174
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:19,049
JP怀恩化学实验室所有
"Property of J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab."

175
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,023
那是沃尔特学校的
That's Walt's school.

176
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,075
说好了3点开始的
We were supposed to start at 3.

177
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:46,075
我在外面做大买卖的  兄弟  莫急
I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill.

178
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:50,050
预付费手机  拿去用吧
Hey. Prepaid cell phone. Use it.

179
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:02,010
-这是多少钱  -26张大票子
- How much is this? - 26 big ones.

180
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:05,076
就这么多  26000美元
Is that all? $26,000?

181
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,025
不  是2600
No, that's 26 hundred,

182
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,091
你的那份是1300
And your share is 13,

183
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:13,046
再扣除那部手机的25美金
Minus 25 bucks for that phone.

184
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:17,036
-你卖出去多少冰毒  -差不多1盎司吧
- How much meth did you sell?  - Nearly an ounce.

185
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,038
上次我查的时候  
Last time I checked,

186
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:25,040
足足有一磅[1磅=16盎司]
there were 16 ounces to a pound.

187
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,066
剩下那些都被你吸了吗
You smoked the rest?

188
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,023
整个晚上我都在兜售冰毒
I've been out there all night slinging crystal.

189
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,034
一次1/10磅  
You think it's cake

190
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,023
你当是卖蛋糕呢
moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

191
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,030
你干嘛这么小量的卖
Why are you selling it in such small quanties?

192
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:37,013
为什么不把一整磅直接出手
Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?

193
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:39,013
卖给谁  你以为我是刀疤脸啊
To who? What do I look like, Scarface?

194
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:41,050
这可不能接受
This is unacceptable.

195
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,055
我可是在犯罪啊
I am breaking the law here.

196
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,041
这么点钱可不值得冒这么大风险
This return is too little for the risk.

197
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,070
我以为你今天准备再做一磅呢
I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.

198
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:50,041
或许你很精通化学
You may know a lot about chemistry, man.

199
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,019
但你对贩毒却一窍不通
But you don't know jack about slinging dope.

200
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:57,016
告诉你吧  我觉得你缺乏动力
Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it.

201
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:02,044
你应该更加发挥想象
You've got to be more imaginative, you know?

202
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:05,042
打破常规思维
Just think outside the box here.

203
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:08,088
我们得大量出货  
We have to move our product in bulk,

204
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,040
大宗批发
wholesale, now.

205
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,083
怎么才能办到
How do we do that?

206
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:17,027
-你是说找个大毒枭  -没错
- What do you mean, to a distributor? - Yes. Yes.

207
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,055
我们就需要这个  一个大毒枭
That's what we need. We need a distributor now.

208
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,047
你认识这样的人吗
Do you know anyone like that?

209
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,073
是的  以前认识个  不过被你杀了
Yeah, I mean I used to until you killed him.

210
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,014
谁上了疯狂小八的位
So who took Krazy-8's place?

211
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,048
一个叫Tuco的家伙
Some guy named Tuco.

212
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:47,002
听说是个十足的混球
A bad ass, from what I hear.

213
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:50,088
好吧  屠库  去跟屠库谈谈吧
Tuco, okay. So then just go talk to Tuco.

214
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,059
没错
Right.

215
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,088
就像"你好  先生  我知道你不认识我"
Like,"Hello, sir. Hey, I know you don't know me,

216
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:58,023
你有兴趣入手大量冰毒吗
"But would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

217
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:01,034
是的  但是你要用点推销技巧
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

218
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,046
你根本不明白那人是有案底的黑帮分子
You just don't get it, man.  This guy's O.G.

219
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,014
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

220
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:07,025
拜托  就是说他地位很高
Jesus, look, he's upper level, man.

221
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,040
他不人跟陌生人做生意的
He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know.

222
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,011
你不懂这行的规矩
You don't understand the way it works.

223
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:16,010
你不能就这样冲去找上面贩冰毒的
You can't just bum rush some high-level ice man

224
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,024
抢别人的生意做  懂吗
And start cutting deals, okay?

225
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:19,087
太冒险了  你得有门路
It's risky. You need an intro.

226
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,094
你得找人做担保
You need someone to vouch.

227
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:24,028
那谁介绍你认识疯狂小八的
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

228
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:25,016
埃米利奥  那是因为
Emilio. That's only because

229
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,075
我三年级就认识他了
I knew him from, like, third grade.

230
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:28,042
我们现在又不能找埃米利奥  
We can't talk to Emilio, either... -

231
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,025
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

232
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:34,034
听着  怀特老师  这样太冒险了
Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky.

233
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,083
懂吗  我们现在也是在赚钱
Okay? I mean, we're making money.

234
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,076
干嘛你不满足点呢
Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is?

235
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,098
你就不能TMD胆子大点
Just grow some fucking balls!

236
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,089
还是等到星期一吗
Wait till Monday again?

237
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:29,039
是的  谢谢
Yes, please. Thank you.

238
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,048
怀特老师
Mr. White.

239
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,002
谢谢你  雨果
Thank you, Hugo.

240
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,056
-咚咚咚  -嘿
- Knock-knock. - Oh, hey.

241
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:39,003
-沃尔特  感觉怎么样  -很好
- How are you feeling, Walt? - Good.

242
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:43,036
有人来找你
Are you up for having a visitor?

243
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,090
嘿  伙计
Hey, buddy.

244
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:50,003
需要什么尽管说
Let me know if you need anything.

245
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:52,058
我会的  谢谢你  卡门
I will. Thank you, Carmen.

246
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,079
该死
Damn.

247
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,037
这小妞的屁股可真翘
That chick's got an ass like an onion.

248
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,004
真是太正点了
Makes me want to cry.

249
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:03,043
你来这儿有事吗
So what are you doing here?

250
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:06,015
我有些问题想问你
Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you,

251
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,055
关于工作的
Work-related.

252
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,001
你有空吗  待会儿也行  
You okay? I could come back later.

253
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,077
不  现在很好
No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

254
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:13,027
现在很好
Everything's fine.

255
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:16,061
你说什么和工作有关
What do you mean work-related, though?

256
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,082
你认得这个吗
Do you recognize that?

257
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,008
不认识
No.

258
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,021
这是用来制毒的
That was used to cook meth.

259
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,061
在离这40英里的印第安人地盘上找到
Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.

260
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,077
里面的一个标牌上写着
Old label on the inside used to say...

261
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,044
J.P.怀恩化学实验室
J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

262
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:42,059
真的吗
Really?

263
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,048
我不知道它是怎么会是这里的
I don't understand how that came from here.

264
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:47,024
我还希望你能帮我的忙  
I was hoping you could help me with that.

265
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,072
我们在一辆弃车旁找到的
We found it near an abandoned car

266
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,099
那车是我们一个线人的
Belonging to one of our snitches.

267
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,017
线人
A snitch?

268
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,093
没错  我们的一个卧底
Yeah, one of our confidential informants.

269
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:00,014
最近失踪了  还没有人找到他
Went missing a while back. No body yet,

270
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:02,050
我们肯定他已经  
But we're pretty sure he's, you know...

271
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:06,093
可能被剁成小块喂秃鹰了
Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards.

272
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:12,092
不管怎样  最近少了防毒面罩吗
Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately?

273
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,085
不  没有
No. No.

274
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,016
我是说  据我所知没有
No, I mean, not that I know of.

275
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,005
我想看一下仪器清单
I'll need to take a look at that inventory.

276
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:24,052
没问题  单子就贴在墙上
Sure. I got a list hanging on the wall.

277
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,078
你介意我看一下你的储藏室吗
You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?

278
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,027
当然不  随便看
Not at all, no. Be my guest.

279
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,060
哪些人有这里的钥匙
Right. So who's got keys?

280
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:38,037
理科教师  校工
Well, the science faculty, the staff,

281
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,029
卡门  副校长也有
Carmen, the vice principal has the master,

282
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,062
还有我 
And me.

283
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:44,064
学生呢
How about students?

284
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:46,018
不  没有
No, no.

285
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,015
没有学生有这里的钥匙
No students have keys.

286
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,093
我希望也是
I should hope not.

287
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:52,080
我想问的是有人知道你把这些放在这里吗
My question is do any know where you keep them?

288
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,012
我想没有  没有
I don't think so. No.

289
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,092
而且钥匙我是每天随身带着的  所以
Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so...

290
00:22:57,098 --> 00:23:00,053
沃尔特  我知道他们是你的学生
Walt, look, I know they're your students, but,

291
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,060
小看他们  可就大错特错了
Do not underestimate them. Big mistake.

292
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:05,068
还有别的防毒面罩吗
Are there any other respirators?

293
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:07,015
呃  没有
Uh, no.

294
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:10,004
这里只有6个  清单上写着8个
Because I'm counting six. Inventory says eight.

295
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,047
玻璃仪器好像也少了很多
Glassware looking a little sparse.

296
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,097
-有吗  -对
- Is it? - Yeah.

297
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:21,035
至少缺了几个厄伦美厄细颈瓶
You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least.

298
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,046
哦  对
Oh, yeah.

299
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:27,059
一个5000毫升的圆底烧瓶
A 5,000 milliliter round bottom.

300
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,040
制毒的家伙们最爱用这个了
Meth heads love to brew in this, baby.

301
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,032
不接吗
Going to answer that?

302
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,033
不  不过是  不接了
No, it's just... No, I don't...

303
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,066
可能是斯凯勒  可能她遇上什么麻烦了
Maybe it's Skyler. She's in trouble or something.

304
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,001
我觉得还是接的好
Don't ignore it on my account.

305
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,044
接吧  我自己能看
Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.

306
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:44,035
-接吧  -好吧
- Jeez. - Okay.

307
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,018

请讲

00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:54,043
-不方便说话吗  -当然
- Bad time to talk? - Absolutely.

311
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:56,000
好吧  那就听我说
All right, so just listen.

312
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:59,007
知道我们上次说的那个人吧  屠库
You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?

313
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,032
我朋友瘦子彼得
Turns out my boy Skinny Pete

314
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:04,040
和他在洛斯鲁纳斯监狱蹲一间板房
Was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas.

315
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,095
我们找到路子了
So we got our in.

316
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:08,099
我们现在就拿着一磅去找那家伙
We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.

317
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,061
好的
Okay, then.

318
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:13,003
非常感谢您打来电话
Thank you very much for calling.

319
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:18,077
我的医生真是热心
My doctor is very solicitous.

320
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:20,002
听着  兄弟  
Look, buddy,

321
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,008
我不想让你惹上麻烦
the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water,

322
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:25,059
但是有些制毒的家伙很喜欢这里
But some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

323
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,056
你最好把自己的地盘看紧点
You got to keep a better watch over your turf.

324
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,070
我会的
I will.

325
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,048
我可不想别人怀疑到你头上来  好吗
We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?

326
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,024
没错
Right. No.

327
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,089
没错  当然不想
Right. Absolutely not.

328
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:49,044
你真和这家伙很铁吗
So you're sure you're tight with this guy?

329
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:51,061
跟兄弟一样
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

330
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:10,071
伙计  我可是瘦子彼得
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

331
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:22,018
也许这主意不怎么好  我们走吧
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come on.

332
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,041
伙计  瞧见没
Yo, man. That's what's happening.

333
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:44,019
屠库要见我们
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

334
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,075
犯不着  老兄  我和屠库很熟
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

335
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:14,057
屠库  还好吗兄弟
Tuco. What's happening, my brother?

336
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,086
这地方不坏啊
Sick crib, yo.

337
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:25,003
出来以后混得不赖啊
You been keeping it real since you been sprung.

338
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,085
干多久了  一年
What's it been, like a year?

339
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,004
-你朋友  -对  杰西
- This your boy?  - Yeah, Jesse.

340
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,040
这家伙带了我之前跟你说的东西
The dude with the glass I was telling you about.

341
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:34,000
久仰
Hey, man. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

342
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,016
东西拿来看看
Break out the ice.

343
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:53,089
搞一口
Take a bump.

344
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,090
别担心  我不是条子
No worries, man. I'm no cop.

345
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:59,086
我说搞一口
I said hit it.

346
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,001
好
All right.

347
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:24,090
这真TM爽翻了
This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

348
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,008
-哪弄来的  -我做的
- Where'd you get it? - I cooked it.

349
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,006
鬼扯
Bullshit!

350
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,065
你为谁干活
Who you working for?

351
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:35,023
不为谁  
No one, man. I mean,

352
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:37,008
我有个制毒的搭档
I have a partner that I cook with,

353
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,057
就是这样
But that's it.

354
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:43,022
好吧
All right.

355
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,059
成交
We got a deal.

356
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:49,071
看吧  我就说屠库会带上你的
See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.

357
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,065
好
Cool.

358
00:27:51,023 --> 00:27:52,096
我还没说价钱呢
I haven't said how much.

359
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:04,047
说吧  多少
All right. How much?

360
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,094
3万5一磅
35 large for the pound.

361
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,042
瞧  还差点
Well, you're a little light, ese.

362
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,031
没关系  别紧张  很好
It's all right. Don't sweat it. It's all good.

363
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,078
好了  你们可以滚了
It's good. Walk. Get out of here.

364
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:26,040
-那钱呢  -你会拿到的
- What about the money?  - You'll get it.

365
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,057
这是寄售
This is a consignment operation.

366
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,079
你要赊3万5吗
You want me to float 35 G's?

367
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,086
你不信我
You don't trust me?

368
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,045
不  不  不是那样的  
No, no. Hey, it's not that, man.

369
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:40,096
只是  你知道  我不
It's just, you know, I don't...

370
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:42,080
我没这么做过生意
I don't do business that way.

371
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:45,034
见鬼  已经成交了
Tough shit! The deal is done!

372
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:49,052
你不是说这样行的吗
You said this was cool.

373
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:51,058
交钱拿货  先付钱
Get money for meth. Cash up front.

374
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:54,051
别说预付了  Tuco会给钱的
Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it.

375
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:58,006
我可不用你这废柴来给我担保
I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!

376
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,057
放开
Come on!

377
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,028
放开
Oh, come on!

378
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:22,088
你给我拿来的货是挺纯
All right, you brought me some really clean crystal.

379
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:27,091
你想要预付款吗
Do you really want your money up front?

380
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:52,043
预付款
Up front.

381
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:25,009
除了我
Nobody moves crystal

382
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,006
没人能在南谷贩毒
In the South Valley but me, bitch!

383
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:50,058
早安  雨果
Good morning, Hugo.

384
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:54,099
不介意我叫你雨果吧  雨果
Don't mind if I call you Hugo... Hugo.

385
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,009
街上还从没有过这么多人
We've never had a crowd on the street like that.

386
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:03,053
那不是汉克姨父
Is that Uncle Hank?

387
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:11,049
他逮捕了阿楚莱塔先生
Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.

388
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:14,041
这是怎么回事  
This doesn't make any sense to me at all.

389
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,034
我不明白
I don't understand.

390
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,002
我给你4个字  背景调查  
I got two words for you: background check.

391
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,086
行了吗
How about that?

392
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:24,031
哟  哟  哟  148-3369
Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369,

393
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,086
代表阿尔布开克
Representing the ABQ.

394
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,026
何事  贱人
What up, biatch?

395
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:29,012
提示音后留话
Leave it at the tone.

396
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:32,030
你究竟跑哪去了  给我回电话
Where the hell are you? Call me back.

397
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:35,010
-沃尔特  -怎么
- Hey, Walt. - Yeah?

398
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:37,065
汉克要发牌了
Hank's about to deal.

399
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:39,098
好  我马上过去
Okay. I'll be right there.

400
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,088
瞧瞧这一轮是什么牌
All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.

401
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:52,055
你看起来不错啊  沃尔特
You're looking good, Walt.

402
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,007
气色好多了
Your color's better.

403
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:56,011
是吗  谢谢
Yeah? Thanks.

404
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,008
其实他现在吃的药物药性很强
He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.

405
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,062
戴尔克沃利医生想劝他
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into

406
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:03,015
休息一段时间  但是
taking some time off from work, but...

407
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:05,091
其实我今早和卡门谈过了
Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning,

408
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:08,085
他们在这几周会找个代课老师
And they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.

409
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:12,051
我还没来得及告诉你  抱歉
I just didn't have a chance to tell you. Sorry.

410
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:14,006
该你下注  硬汉
Your bet, tough guy.

411
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:15,072
看牌
Check.

412
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:17,096
看牌
Yeah. Check.

413
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:20,023
都看牌
Check's in the mail.

414
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,015
1千万
10 million.

415
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:24,007
红的是2千5百万  蓝的才是1千万
Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.

416
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:27,003
那就2千5百万好了  我就这么玩
Then 25 million because that's how I roll.

417
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:30,025
汉克姨父  那天你为什么
Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting

418
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:33,002
要逮捕阿楚莱塔先生
Mr. Archuleta the other day?

419
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,039
他人不错
He's a pretty cool guy.

420
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:37,051
可他有前科
Well, turns out that he has a record.

421
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,000
两次非法占有
Yeah. Couple of possession beefs.

422
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,084
我们查出就是他
We figure he was the guy

423
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,021
偷了你学校的化学实验器材
That was stealing your school's chemistry gear.

424
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:46,054
他有钥匙
I mean, you know, he had a key.

425
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:48,031
符合特征
Fit the profile.

426
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,065
我们搜了他的车  
When we searched his truck,

427
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,072
找到个卷了大麻的大雪茄
We found a big old fat blunt,

428
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:55,071
这说明大个子雨果不是什么好人
which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

429
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,006
到你了  沃尔特
It's to you, Walt.

430
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:59,053
跟注
Yeah, I'll call.

431
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:01,077
真不敢不相信
I can't believe the school system

432
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:03,078
学校竟不知道这家伙有前科
Didn't know about this guy's record.

433
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,063
真可怕
I mean, that's pretty scary.

434
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:08,052
他是怎么混进去的
How could something like that just slip through the cracks?

435
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,024
我不知道  不管怎样
I don't know. I mean, for what it's worth,

436
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:14,047
我觉得雨果根本不像是个会偷东西的人
Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief.

437
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:17,060
沃尔特  这和个人感情无关
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but

438
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,058
你哪能一眼看出
You wouldn't know a criminal

439
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:20,093
谁是罪犯
if he was close enough to check you for a hernia.

440
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:25,044
也就是说  我们搞到了搜查令
Now, that said, we got a search warrant,

441
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,055
然后端了雨果的老窝
And we tore old Hugo's house apart.

442
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:30,018
原来他也是个瘾君子
Turns out he's a major league pothead.

443
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,016
但他那没有你的化学仪器
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.

444
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,022
赶紧出牌
You hiding something?

445
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:41,084
我跟
I'm in.

446
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:44,012
接着是底牌
And the river card.

447
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:49,022
牌不行  我不跟了
Yeah, I got nothing. I'm out.

448
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,028
赞
Yowsa!

449
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:57,088
当漏财大姐都不跟的时候
When old "holes in her purse" bails,

450
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,065
你就该知道你已经无路可退了
You know you're in deep.

451
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:02,046
就剩你跟我了  伙计
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

452
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,095
雨果接下来会怎么样
What's going to happen to him? Hugo.

453
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:09,009
应该是丢了工作吧
Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job,

454
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:10,075
他活该的
Like he should.

455
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:12,087
没准还会在牢里呆几个月
Probably spend a couple months in County,

456
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:14,074
他也不是第一次了
As it's not his first rap.

457
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,070
我还等着呢
I'm waiting.

458
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,023
你是负隅顽抗呢
You going to man up,

459
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,041
还是缴械投降
Or you're going to puss out?

460
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,025
汉克
Hank.

461
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:26,012
啥  不好意思
What? Sorry.

462
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,068
全跟
I'm all in.

463
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:41,025
你可是大大的坏啊  你个骗子
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

464
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:44,019
放烟雾弹呢哈
What are you smoking there, huh?

465
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,096
拿着带心牌了吧
You got a heart?

466
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:48,039
是红心 对不对
You got the flush, don't you?

467
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,078
才不上你的套儿  哥们  我扔牌
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

468
00:34:58,027 --> 00:35:00,011
真够扫兴的
Talk about anti-climactic.

469
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:02,062
你牌不可能那么坏的
Your cards couldn't have been that bad.

470
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:05,059
天啊  老A你都扔了
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace...

471
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,019
你这是干嘛呢  不会吧
What are you doing? Don't.

472
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,090
还有张老K  就为了
...And a cowboy, for...

473
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:16,002
这个破牌
A handful of nothing.

474
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:18,061
是谁啊
Who is this?

475
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,075
我找的是杰西·平克曼
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

476
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:25,068
那么他上哪去了
Well, where is he, then?

477
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,035
你就是那谁吧
You the guy?

478
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,087
是  我就是
Yeah, I'm the guy.

479
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,098
他情况怎么样
How is he?

480
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:54,050
还能咋样  断了几根肋骨
Got some busted ribs and like that.

481
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:57,092
真是败得可以
Got messed up pretty good.

482
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,051
我一直劝屠库别打太狠
I was all like "Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

483
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:06,051
真不知道他是吃错了哪门子药
I don't know what got into him. Seriously.

484
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:11,024
他还昏着呢  深度昏迷
Oh, he's out, man, way out.

485
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:14,030
还得持续上一段时间
They got him doped up big-time.

486
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:21,095
那么  货都是你造的吗
So you're the cook, huh?

487
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,062
喂  我还不知道你名呢
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

488
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,085
给我说说这个屠库
Tell me about this Tuco.

489
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,003
把他一切都告诉我
Tell me everything about him.

490
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:29,099
早上好
Good morning.

491
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:34,086
麻烦给我递下黄油
Would you pass the butter, please?

492
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,027
秃头够衰的  老爸
Bad ass, Dad.

493
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,065
你就是屠库
You Tuco?

494
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,059
我要跟屠库谈谈
I want to talk to Tuco,

495
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:42,064
见不到他我就不走
And I'm not leaving until I do.

496
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,019
你叫什么
What's your name?

497
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:11,041
海森堡
Heisenberg.

498
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:13,011
海森堡
Heisenberg.

499
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,064
坐  海森堡
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

500
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:21,010
我不会在这呆太久
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

501
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,070
不会太久
No?

502
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,054
好吧
All right.

503
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,005
那就站着吧
Be that way.

504
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:32,010
是你要会面的
It's your meeting.

505
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,083
为什么不先说说
Why don't you start talking

506
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,081
你想要什么
And tell me what you want?

507
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:38,033
5万块
$50,000.

508
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:43,020
哈  哥们  5万块
Oh, man! 50 G's?

509
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:44,082
你怎么想出来的
How you figure that?

510
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:47,019
3万5支付你抢走的货
35 for the pound of meth you stole

511
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,068
剩下的1万5
and another 15

512
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,073
用来补偿我同伙受的伤
for my Partner's pain and suffering.

513
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:57,019
同伙
Partner.

514
00:43:04,078 --> 00:43:07,093
啊  想起来了  那个小贱人
Oh, yeah. I remember that little bitch.

515
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,082
那你就是他老爹了
So you must be Daddy.

516
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,037
让我理下思路啊
Let me get this straight.

517
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,047
我抢了你的货  是吧
I steal your dope, hmm?

518
00:43:26,014 --> 00:43:30,001
狠揍了那小子一顿
I beat the piss out of your mule boy!

519
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:32,052
然后你又带着更多的货
And then you walk in here,

520
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:34,041
到我这来了
And you bring me more meth?

521
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:41,027
这想法真是赞
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

522
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,041
超赞
Brilliant.

523
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:46,025
有一点你说错了
You got one part of that wrong.

524
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:53,047
这不是冰毒
This is not meth.

525
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:22,008
这个死疯子
Are you fucking nuts?

526
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,093
你还想见识下
You want to find out?

527
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,055
别开枪  停下来
No-Doze, Gonzo, calma!

528
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:29,067
淡定  要淡定
Calma. Calma.

529
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:33,075
你真有种
You got balls.

530
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,054
我给你钱
I'll give you that.

531
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:37,014
行了吧
All right. All right.

532
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:39,011
我把钱给你
I'll give you your money.

533
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:47,028
你同伙上次带过来的货
That crystal that your partner brought me,

534
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,006
卖得比跟10块钱的站街女
It sold faster

535
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,061
打一炮的速度还要快
Than $10 ass in TJ.

536
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:58,067
也就是说  下星期
What say you bring me

537
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,084
你再给我带一磅过来吧
Another pound next week?

538
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,071
一手交钱一手交货
Money up front.

539
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,001
成交
All right.

540
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:10,000
一手交钱  一手交货
Money up front.

541
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,038
有时候  为了赚钱
Sometimes you got to rob

542
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:17,085
也不得不抢一点
To keep your riches.

543
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:22,018
这是我们靠长期实践得出的真理
Just as long as we got an understanding.

544
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:27,010
1磅不卖
One pound is not going to cut it.

545
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:29,006
要买就得买2磅
You have to take two.

546
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:37,017
成交
Orale.

547
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:41,055
这是什么鬼玩意
What is that shit?

548
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,027
雷酸汞盐 
Fulminated mercury.

549
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:49,040
再掺合点化学改造
A little tweak of chemistry.
