00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,066
你
You are..

8
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,003
有货吗
You selling?

9
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,084
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,020
好  那就算了
OK. That's cool.

11
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,023
我的意思是  如果你有货
I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,

12
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,044
我想来点儿试试
I could maybe do with a teenth.

13
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:48,036
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,044
伙计  我已经闻到条子的味道了
Dude, I so smell bacon.

15
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,039
什么  你在说什么
What? What are you talking about?

16
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,086
我不知道为什么
Gee, I don't know.

17
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,046
那边  那辆棕色货车
How about over there. That brown van.

18
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:02,091
-那是你的  对吧  -什么棕色货车
- That's yours, right? - What brown van?

19
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,077
停得那么隐蔽
Parked all inconspicuous.

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,069
肯定是警车
It's a cop van.

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,091
那里居然还有一辆
Another one right over there.

22
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:15,010
"杜克城市鲜花店"  别装了
"Duke city flowers"? Come on!

23
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,000
就不能有点创意吗
Can't you at least be original?

24
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:20,024
伙计  我真的只想买点货
Dude, I just want to get high.

25
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,066
一辆鲜花货车
A flower van.

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,061
知道吗  你们应该开辆垃圾车
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,090
说真的  不是想要冒犯你
Seriously. And I don't mean to disrespect.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,055
但是如果你真的藏了一堆条子
But if you put a bunch of cops

29
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,097
在垃圾车后面
In the back of a garbage truck

30
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,007
我就不可能真的以为
There's no way I'm seriously thinking

31
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,078
垃圾车后面会有条子跳出来
That there's cops in the back of a garbage truck.

32
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,084
只是建议  唷  你们可以考虑一下
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

33
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:41,010
考虑一下  孩子们
Think about it, boys!

34
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:45,036
好吧  我找错人了
All right. I'm hitting it.

35
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:48,055
你们这些人会这么容易放弃吗
You dudes give up that easy?

36
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,095
我不是条子
I'm not a cop.

37
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,070
那就把衣服撩起来
Then lift your shirt.

38
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,032
让我看看有没有带窃听器
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

39
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,018
好吧  知道吗
All right, you know what?

40
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,063
为了证明你就是个混蛋
Just to show you you're being an asshole.

41
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,036
我被白光刺得睁不开眼了
I'm blinded by white.

42
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:04,097
王八蛋
Douchebag.

43
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:07,025
别这样  只是开玩笑  回来吧
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

44
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,010
别生气  坐下  来吧
Don't walk away angry. Sit down. Come on.

45
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:14,045
你在抱怨什么
I mean, what are you complaing about?

46
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,099
你还算有点腹肌
You got abs, man. Kinda.

47
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,024
随你怎么说
Whatever, dude.

48
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,021
我不太想买了
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.

49
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,050
你已经把我的瘾都搞没了
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.

50
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,044
伙计  别这样
Come on. Don't be like that.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,040
我只是要先证明
I just need you to prove it, you know?

52
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,087
证明你不是条子
Prove you're not a cop.

53
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:33,039
要怎么做你才相信
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

54
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,091
我也不知道
I don't know.

55
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,079
有了
I got it.

56
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:41,041
到那里  给那家伙脸上来一拳
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.

57
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:42,058
哪个
Which dude?

58
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,038
那个吗
That dude?

59
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:46,076
没门  他会把我揍扁的
No way. He'd kick my ass.

60
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,002
那倒是真的
True that.

61
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,079
太难了
This is so hard, you know?

62
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,015
我知道了
I know.

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,017
很容易
It's simple.

64
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,005
如果你问一个条子他是不是条子
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,

65
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,048
他有责任告知你身份
He's, like, obligated to tell you.

66
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,035
宪法里那么规定的
It's in the constitution.

67
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,046
美国宪法吗
Constitution of America?

68
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,060
来吧  你问吧
So go ahead and ask.

69
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,028
你是条子吗
Are you a cop?

70
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:19,039
不是这样的  应该正式一定
Not like that. ask it, like, official.

71
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,072
你是一位警官吗
Are you a police officer?

72
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:25,072
不 我不是一位警官
No.I am not a police officer.

73
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,085
那好吧  一口175
Okay, then. 175 for a teenth.

绝

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
命

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020
毒

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,020

我原本有份好工作
I had a good job

90

直到老板指控我偷东西开始
until my boss accused me of stealing.

91
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,097
快打电话给索尔
I'd better call Saul!

我刚从聚会回来  担心生意的事
I was out partying, minding my own business...

我是索尔·古德曼  你知道自己拥有的权利吗
Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights?

96
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,012
宪法规定你有  我也说你有
The constitution says you do. And so do I.

97
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,045
除非你被定罪  在此之前我都相信
I believe that until proven guilty,

98

这个国家的男女老少都是清白的

00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,051
建议你从床开始
I suggest you start with a bed.

104
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:43,062
天啊  真想在这里抽一口
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,035
-你不能  -我知道  我知道
- Well, you can't. - I know. I know.

106
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,072
只是说说
I'm just saying.

107
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,094
别以为我闻不出这里有大麻的味道
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

108
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,007
你最好祈祷味道快点散掉
You better seriously hope that airs out.

109
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,069
我爸会扣你的押金的

听着
Well, listen.

116
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:20,083
既然我已经损失了所有的押金
Since I already lost my deposit and all,

117
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,032
或许我们该点上一口
Maybe we should light up.

118

你肯定吗
You sure?

120
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:34,074
我抽一口行吗
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

121
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,009
你可能会改变主意
Maybe you'll change your mind.

122
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,055
随便你吧
Do what you want to do, I guess.

123
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,029
-是我说了什么吗  -没有
- What'd I say? - Nothing.

124
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,095
只是我得走了
I just have to go is all.

125
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:18,005
这是什么
What's this?

126
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,018
18个月的纪念章
My 18-month chip.

127
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:25,067
我正在戒毒
I'm in recovery. And you know,

128
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,093
大麻就好像是
Pot is, like,

129
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,030
踏脚石
Stepping stones.

130
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,077
戒毒
Recovery?

131
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,051
真厉害
That's cool.

132
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,006
绝对正确的选择
Right on.

133
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,059
很佩服
I respect that.

134
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:44,009
我也抽得不多
You know, I don't really burn much anymore.

135
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,082
只是有时来一根
It's just a sometime thing.

136
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:51,004
不过以后  再不会在这房子里了
But no more, like, in the house.

137
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:58,034
想出去吃点东西吗
So, you want to go grab some dinner?

138
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,066
我们可以去吃点中餐
I could really go for some chinese.

139
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,026
我真的要走了
I better hit it.

140
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,024
我们还好吧
We cool?

141
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,080
顺便说一句  你的卫星电视还开着
Your satellite's on, by the way.

142
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,002
屏幕看起来还真爽
That screen's bad-ass.

143
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,096
我只是觉得这有点过了
I just think it's asking a lot.

144
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,031
他知道情况
He knows it.

145
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,095
他只想表达歉意
He's done nothing but apologize.

146
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,081
以后每个周末都要去吗
Is this going to be every weekend now?

147
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:45,088
只到这个季度末  你知道的
It's just the end of the quarter. You remember how that was.

148
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,038
我赚的可是双倍薪酬
But I am earning double time.

149
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,048
看在钱的份上
There's a bright side.

150
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,017
等世上最懒的孩子醒了以后
So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up,

151
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,047
让他把运动鞋洗了  代我跟他说再见
Tell him he better wash those sneakers. And I said "bye."

152
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:59,025
顺便告诉他这次要把鞋晾干
And tell him to let them air dry this time.

153
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,039
我可不喜欢鞋子在我的烘干机里
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.

154
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,064
怎么了
What?

155
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,052
星期六也要穿得那么正式吗
What, you don't even get casual Saturday?

156
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,058
你看起来真美
You look nice is all.

157
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,028
这是工作  大家都这么穿
It's work. Everybody's gonna be there.

158
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,059
好吧
OK

159
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,006
今晚买个披萨吃怎么样
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

160
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,060
再见-再见
Bye-Bye

164
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,037
我真不知道该怎么办
I just don't know what to do.

165
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,031
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

166
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,079
玛丽
Hi, Mary.

167
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,032
是我  发生什么事了
It's me. What's up?

168
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,075
昨天我回家的时候  发现他回来了
Yesterday I got home and found him.

169
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:06,015
他都没告诉过我要回来
He didn't even tell me he was coming.

170
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,001
有人被杀了吗  
A man was killed?

171
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,015
一个联邦调查局的  就在他眼前
A federale, right in front of him.

172
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,094
三个探员受了伤  有一个没了一条腿
Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.

173
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,026
就好像是在伊拉克一样
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.

174
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,093
-那些爆炸装置  -上帝啊
- The IEDs. - Oh, jesus.

175
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,002
我从史蒂芬·戈麦斯那里听来的
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.

176
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:27,015
汉克跟他的上级汇报了整整半小时
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.

177
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,047
汉克都该拿奥斯卡了  他装得若无其事
Hank should win an oscar. He's so damn breezy with the man.

178
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,048
一挂上电话  又躺到床上去了
He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed.

179
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,079
只是不停地说
And all he keeps saying is,

180
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,088
我很好  我没事  让我一个人呆会儿
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,020
宝贝  现在不是时候
Baby, not now.

182
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,098
是我  汉克
It's me, Hank.

183
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,050
抱歉
Sorry.

184
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,082
嘿  伙计
Hey, buddy.

185
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,097
怎么了
What's up?

186
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,089
我只是
I just...

187
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,026
介意我进来吗
Do you mind if I...

188
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,002
那么
So...

189
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,034
你感觉怎么样
How you doing?

190
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,072
不太好
You know. Lousy.

191
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,018
拉肚子  一次又一次
Montezuma's revenge, big time.

192
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,070
所有的东西从我体内通过
I mean, everything's going through me

193
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:45,000
感觉就像屎通过了锡管[指拉得身体没知觉]
Like crap through a tin horn.

194
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:47,033
最好别靠我太近
Better not get too close.

195
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,002
我要冒个险
I'll take my chances.

196
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:02,003
你大概知道华雷斯的事了吧
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juarez?

197
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
太可怕了
Terrible.

198
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,018
还能指望畜生干出些什么
What do you expect? Freaking animals.

199
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,075
像是现代版的电影"启示录"
Like Apocalypse now down there.

200
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,093
[译注: 影片《现代启示录》]

201
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,093
就像是窝在丛林里的科茨上校
It's like colonel kurtz holed up in his jungle.

202
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,043
而埃尔帕索的指挥官让我回家
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

203
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,051
这可是个英明的领导决策
Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?

204
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,011
不让二把手
You don't put your second most senior man

205
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,031
继续追踪那些没娘养的混蛋
on the trail of those motherless bastards,

206
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,099
而是让他回家
You send him home.

207
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,044
我被告知  "他去取证物袋了"
I was, you know, "He's out getting an evidence bag,

208
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:39,009
"所以毫发无伤"
"and so ends up without a scratch on him.

209
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:42,011
"照片肯定是有问题"
"So must be something wrong with that picture."

210
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,035
所以你回来了不再回去了
So are you home for good?

211
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,065
随机应变吧
Playing it by ear.

212
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,090
"待定"
"To be determined."

213
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:01,038
有没有想过跟谁谈谈这事
Think you might want to talk it through with somebody?

214
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:02,094
跟谁  心理医生
What? A shrink?

215
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,096
我不能  走出这一步
I can't. Start going down that road,

216
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,055
工作就想别要了
Kiss your career goodbye.

217
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,058
或者玛丽
Or Marie.

218
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,065
或者我
Or me,

219
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,097
如果你愿意
If you like.

220
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:23,034
我不知道该怎么说
You know, I don't know how to say this.

221
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,018
我做的事情
You know, the things I deal with,

222
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,010
你我之间不太有
You and me don't have much of a...

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,079
用你的话说就是共同感受
What you might call an experiential overlap.

224
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,060
如果我说有呢
What if I told you we do?

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,046
我一辈子都过得战战兢兢
I have spent my whole life scared.

226
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:05,007
担心有些事会发生
Frightened of things that could happen,

227
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,095
可能会发生  可能不会发生
Might happen, might not happen.

228
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,095
整整50年我都这么过来
50 years I spent like that.

229
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:16,028
每天3点钟就惊醒
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.

230
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,018
可你知道吗
But you know what?

231
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,046
自从收到诊断书
Ever since my diagnosis...

232
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,011
我反而睡得香
I sleep just fine.

233
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,032
然后我意识到
And I came to realize

234
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,000
恐惧才是最糟糕的事情
It's that fear that's the worst of it.

235
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,095
恐惧才是真正的敌人
That's the real enemy.

236
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,008
所以
So...

237
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,076
回到现实世界
Get out in the real world.

238
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,042
狠狠地揍那个杂种
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can

239
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,099
打他个满地找牙
Right in the teeth.

240
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,060
再数一遍
Do it again.

241
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,078
快点
Go on.

242
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,097
一万整  跟上次一样  一分不少
$10,000 even. Same as last time. It's totally accurate.

243
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,040
我和你  会把这机器填满
You and I, we are gonna feed this machine.

244
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:34,022
让它24小时转个不停
I want it running 24 hours a day.

245
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,034
说的是
Right on.

246
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,084
不是你的吧  我可收下了
Not yours, I take it.

247
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,021
我们分分  一万
We got 10,

248
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,028
两万
20,

249
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,074
三万
30,

250
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,038
每人四万五
44.5 each.

251
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,024
三磅应该是每人四万八
3 pounds should be 48 each.

252
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,033
少了谁的
Who's short?

253
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,025
别急  没人少给钱
Don't freak. We didn't get ripped off.

254
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:09,044
猴子的钱还没交齐
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.

255
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,099
我听说他准备熬通宵
I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter,

256
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,051
-这会儿八成还睡着呢  -那就叫他起来
- So he's probably still in the sack. - Then wake him up.

257
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,082
叫他给了钱再去睡
He can sleep after we're paid.

258
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,023
你搞这么猴急干啥
Why you gotta be such a hard on?

259
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,083
你不是他兄弟  你是他老板
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

260
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,042
得让他们怕你  才能赚大钱  记得吗
This only works when they're scared of you. Remember?

261
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,079
见鬼
Jack off.

262
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,045
直接连到语音信箱了
It's going straight to voicemail.

263
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,020
语音信箱
Voicemail?

264
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,019
冷静点儿  好吧  数你的钱
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

265
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,002
康宝
Combo,

00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,005
看见猴子没有
You seen badger?

267
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,051
别帮他打马虎眼
Yo. Don't you cover for him!

268
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,066
我问你问题
I ask you a straight-up question,

269
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:56,049
你就给我直接答
I expect a straight-up anwser.

270
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,073
怎么
Well?

271
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,035
他们不敢告诉我
They were too scared to tell me.

272
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,035
猴子被抓了
Badger got busted.

273
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,028
他在监狱里
He's in jail.

274

宝贝儿  我回来啦
Honey, I'm home!

太慢啦  过得怎么样
Too slow! What's up?

276
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,031
你的命比该死的猫还多[猫有九条命]
You've got more lives than a damn cat.

277
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:11,061
现在我就差学会自己舔毛啦
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.

278
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,043
过得怎么样  伙计们  见到你真好
What's up, guys? Good to see you.

279
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,072

回去工作吧  看在上帝份上

挺过来了
Hanging in?

285
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,014
你看呢
What's it look like?

286
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,053
警局送来的这是什么东西
What's this from APD?

287
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,079
我跟他们联系过  问他们
I been checking with them to see if they

288
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,060
见没见过那位大名鼎鼎的蓝冰毒贩
come across that famous blue meth of yours.

289
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,055
碰巧的是  昨天晚上
Sure enough, last night.

290
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,087
他们抓了个货真价实的毒贩子
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.

291
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,099
我正想开车过去打个招呼
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.

292
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,030
也许你想一起去
Maybe you'd like to go with me.

293
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,078
好啊
Well, all right.

294
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,069
你当面告诉我说你不是警察的  伙计
You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man.

295
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,043
我觉得被利用了
I feel manipulated.

296
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,061
我以为我们能一起出去玩
I thought we were gonna hang out.

297
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,030
我们正一起玩呢  猴子
We are hanging out, badger.

298
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,027
你喜欢我叫你猴子还是布兰登
You like Badger or Brandon?

299
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:28,062
我喜欢  那些  不滥用宪法的人
I like people who don't, like, abuse the constitution.

300
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,026
猴子  听我说

301
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,093
兄弟  我这是在帮你
I'm trying to help you here, man.

302
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,095
只要你告诉我谁给你供货
If you just tell me who your supplier is,

303
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,058
我想你就没什么大事了
I think this can end very well for you.

304
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,012
怎么我不在场就跟我的当事人谈话
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?

305
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:48,045
鬼鬼祟祟的小贱货
You sneaky pete!

306
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,021
什么跟什么呀
Which is which?

307
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,097
怎么  你从娘胎里出来就被警局雇了
What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?

308
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,097
你们这帮家伙越来越年轻了
You guys get younger every...

309
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,025
你跟娃娃脸说了什么  有没有说傻话
What'd you say to baby-face? Did you say anything stupid?

310

貌似小布兰登能提供信息
Seems young Brandon may have information

460
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,081
找到海森堡
that could lead Heisenberg...

461
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,057
开心点
Jesus, cheer up!

462
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,075
这是好消息
This is good news. I mean,

463
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:07,030
布兰登首先冲进粪堆
Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile

464
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,093
他得沾上点古龙水的味道才能出来
And came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.

465
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,036
听着
Look, look.

466
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,063
我觉得  我们应该
I just think that we should

467
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,039
看看有什么其他选择
Review our options.

468
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
选择
Options?

469
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,057
我来告诉你  你有什么选择
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.

470
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,060
你一共有两个选择
And you got a grand total of two.

471
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,063
第一  布兰登老实做事
Option a, Brandon takes the deal.

472
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:29,003
第二  布兰登进监狱
Option b, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary

473
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,072
尝尝被人爆菊花的滋味
And gets his rectum resized about yay big.

474
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,018
听着  会不会
Look, look. what about...

475
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,036
遭人报复  如果猴子
Reprisals? I mean, if badger...

476
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,096
如果布兰登
If Brandon...

477
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,036
把海森堡供出来
Informs on this Heisenberg...

478
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:45,032
要是  希望不会
I mean, what if... god forbid...

479
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,020
他们会不会
That they decide to...

480
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,096
报复
Take revenge?

481
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:52,031
你怎么跟他说的
What have you been telling him?

482
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,056
那孩子一直在叫
The kid keeps spouting off about

483
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,020
"如果我说了  他们会要了我的命"
"if i talk, thehat's not good

484
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,002
现在他可是这案子的关键
Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal.

485
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:02,023
-很好  -一点都不好
- Good. - No, that's not good.

486
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,007
太恐怖了  相信我  先生
That's terrible. Trust me, sir,

487
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,059
你的侄子在监狱里呆不了两星期的
Your nephew won't last in prison two weeks.

488
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:09,007
你得劝他冒一次险
You let him take his chances on the outside.

489
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:11,054
或许我该申请证人保护
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.

490
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,003
不  听我说
No, look, look.

491
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,098
那是一群穷凶极恶的人
These are vicious, desperate people.

492
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,043
我听说
I've been told that

493
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,056
他们有人杀了人
One of them killed another man

494
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:23,032
用ATM机碾碎了他的脑袋
By crushing his head with an ATM machine.

495
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:28,002
人们总喜欢从ATM机中找点乐子
People love to take credit for the fun ones.

496
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,011
被爆头的那个家伙
The guy who got his head smooshed

497
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:31,056
曾经是我的客户  他说
Used to be a cged," he said.

498
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,039
他的妻子杀了他  对吧  这是众所周知的
His wife killed him, all right? It was open and shut.

499
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,012
相信我  你们没啥好担心的
Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?

500
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,096
我会把你侄子弄出来的
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,

501
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,069
保证安然无恙
Get him singing like a canary...

502
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,066
一切都会好的
All's right with the world.

503
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,031
1万美元
$10,000.

504
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,075
1万
10,000.

505
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:03,067
现金付款
Cash to you.

506
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,090
我没说让你不管案子
I'm not saying to throw the case.

507
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,005
别告诉缉毒局
No talking to the DEA.

508
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,064
你说的是我心里想的话吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

509
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,064
是的
Yes.

510
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:21,096
会怎么样
What's it going to be?

511
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:26,074
那家伙不肯被收买
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?

512
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,040
那家伙在那里  是我们口中的索尔·古德曼吗
That dude in there? Saul Goodman we're talking about?

513
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,022
"引起道德公愤"  他说
"Morally outraged," he said.

514
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,090
-威胁我说要报警  -猴子要告密
- Threatened to call the police. - And badger's gonna spill?

515
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,004
像埃克森·瓦尔迪兹号邮轮泄油事件一样
Like the Exxon Valdez.

516
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:41,074
我们该怎么做
So what do we do about it?

517
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,064
弗朗西斯卡  我跟着你回家怎么样
Francesca, how about I follow you home?

518
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,067
不用
No.

519
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,042
确保你安全
For safety!

520
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:03,092
天哪  你差点要了我的命
God, you are killing me with that booty.

521
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:19,054
别这样  伙计们
Talk to me, guys!

522
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,067
别这样  告诉我你们想要怎么样  天哪
Come on. Just tell me what you want! Jesus!

523
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:26,020
不  不  不 ...
Oh, No no...

524
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,065
不是我  是伊格纳西奥  是他
It wasn't me! It was Ignacio! He's the one!

525
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,069
闭嘴
Shut up!

526
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,093
闭嘴
Shut up!

527
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,011
好吧  说英语
All right, just speak english.

528
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:43,058
不是拉罗派你们来的吗  不是拉罗
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

529
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:46,053
-是谁  -谢天谢地
- Who? - Thank god!

530
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,009
我以为
I thought...

531
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,017
先生们  我能为你做些什么
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

532
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,047
任何事  告诉我你需要什么
Anything! Just tell me what you need.

533
00:30:56,074 --> 00:31:00,058
今天下午  我们的同事给你1万美元
This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000.

534
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:02,079
你应该接受那笔钱的
You should have taken it!

535
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:05,073
等等  这是为了感谢我告诉你们他的名字
Wait a minute. This is in regards to what's-his-name?

536
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,040
猴子  布兰登·梅休
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

537
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:11,006
他叔叔  是你们的人
The uncle. That was your guy?

538
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,082
无意冒犯  伙计
No offense, guys, but I don't take

539
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,032
我不接受陌生人的行贿
Bribes from strangers, you know?

540
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:17,075
力求稳妥  那是我的座右铭
Better safe than sorry. That's my motto.

541
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,082
但你的钱我会收的  我保证
But I'll take your money! Sure!

542
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,096
过期无效
That offer's expired, yo.

543
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:26,007
开价有点低  但还过得去  我接受了
It was kind of low anyways. But okay, okay, I'll take it.

544
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:28,025
告诉我  你想要什么
Just tell me what you need.

545
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:30,076
我好说  我会保持乐观的心态
I'm easy. I'm going to keep a happy thought

546
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,032
并且假定这只是一个谈判策略
And assume this is just a negotiating tactic.

547
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,095
好吧  仔细听我说
All right, listen to me very carefully.

548
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,054
你要给猴子·梅休
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best

549
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:41,074
最好的合法辩护
Legal representation ever.

550
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:43,083
别牵扯到缉毒局
But no deals with the DEA!

551
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:48,045
好吗  猴子不会指证任何人的
All right? badger will not identify anyone to anybody.

552
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,093
如果他指证  你就死定了
If he does, you're dead!

553
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:54,081
你为什么不杀了猴子
Why don't you just kill badger?

554
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:01,035
听我说  伙计们  如果一只蚊子在你旁边嗡嗡叫
Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you,

555
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,013
咬了你的屁股  
It bites you on the ass, you don't go

556
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,073
你不会去找蚊子的律师算账吧
gunning for the mosquito's attorney.

557
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:07,089
你会去拿苍蝇拍  可以这样比喻
You go grab a flyswatter. I mean, so to speak.

558
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,007
冒昧的说
I mean, all due respect, do I

559
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,066
这点还需要我为您说明吗
have to spell this out for you?

560
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,016
我们不会杀了猴子的
We're not killing badger, yo!

561
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,063
那你真正的麻烦才出现
Then you got real problems.

562
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,023
缉毒局会像你对我一样
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down

563
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,098
对你的小弟施以严刑
On your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.

564
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:22,060
我不觉得自己能活着回去
I don't think I'm going out on a limb here,

565
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,055
但他也不会顶罪入狱
but he's not gonna like prison.

566
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,038
不管你怎么对我
He's gonna sing like Ceine Dion

567
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:28,065
他会招供的
Regardless of what you do to me.

568
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,038
梅休先生
Mr. Mayhew?

569
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:39,083
我记得你的咳嗽
I recognize your cough.

570
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,002
脱下面具吧  呼吸点新鲜空气
Take that mask off. Get some air.

571
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,049
继续
Go on.

572
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:55,010
放松点  吸气  呼气
Take it easy! Breathe in, breathe out.

573
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:59,012
我想站起来  行吗  我的膝盖有毛病
I'm gonna stand up, all right? 'Cause I got bad knees.

574
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,059
好些了
That's better.

575
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,042
听着  我们三个人准备把这事搞定
Now listen. The three of us are gonna work this out.

576
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,009
怎么搞
How?

577
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:10,042
首先
First things first, you're gonna put

578
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,021
你们每人在我口袋里放一美元
A dollar in my pocket, both of you.

579
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:16,002
你想要律师委托人保密特权吗
You want attorney-client privilege?

580
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,019
这样才能确保天知地知你知我知
So that everything you say is strictly between us.

581
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,045
我是认真的
I mean it!

582
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:24,011
在我口袋里放一美元  拜托  正式一点
Put a dollar in my pocket. Come on, make it official.

583
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,045
快啊  动手
Come on, do it!

584
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:30,082
这就对了  就只是一美元嘛
That's it. Come on. just a dollar.

585
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,009
好了  轮到你了  滑雪迷  来吧
All right, now you, ski bum. come on.

586
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,076
给一美元吧
Give with the dollar.

587
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:40,068
-快啊  -放聪明点
- Go on. - Be smart.

588
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:41,062
怎么
What?

589
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,088
-我只有一张5块的  -5块也行啊
- All I got's a 5.  - I'll take a 5!

590
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,079
来吧  来吧
Come on, already. come on.

591
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:50,092
这就对了嘛
Be cool.

592
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,044
你们现在已经正式
You're now both officially represented

593
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:58,022
授予索尔·古德曼及他的事务所代理
by Sole Goodman and associates.

594
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,075
即使砸掉我律师的饭碗  我也绝对保守秘密
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.

595
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,071
把那个滑雪面具摘下来吧  我感觉像是
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm

596
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,023
在跟地下气象台的人说话一样
talking to a Weather Underground here.

597
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,007
摘下来吧
Do it.

598
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:18,024
所以监狱暴动免谈
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table...

599
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:20,001
这点都同意吧
And we're sure of that?

600
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,058
绝不暴动
No shanking!

601
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,051
好吧  好吧
All right all right.

602
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,062
那么在我看来
Then the way I see it is...

603
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,002
总得有人坐牢
Somebody's going to prison.

604
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,080
关键就在于是谁
It's just a matter of who.

605
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,044
好了
All right.

606
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,003
虽然广告上驴劲十足
Lame-ass TV ads aside,

607
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,018
当了你的律师  为你编了一套不错的托词
Your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

608

00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,061
就是出于你自己的好心

753
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:20,030
拜托  你知道我的每小时工资多少吗
Come on. Have you seen my hourly rate?

754
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,008
顺便问下  你把钱放哪儿
By the way, where do you keep the money?

755
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:26,039
是放在床垫里吗  或者是

那么离警察盯上你又有多远呢
How far behind can the cops be?

You're on to something special.

我愿意为此尽点薄力
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
