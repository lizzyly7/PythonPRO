两个月以后

我们会再看看你身体的反应  重新评估

然后决定你下一步的治疗方案

就在你妻子的预产期  对吗

朝好的方面看吧

不用保险支付  对吗
So, we're not going through an insurer. Is that correct?

00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,054

住院三天  总计一万三

能让格雷琴和埃利奥特帮我们承担一点吗 
Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

56
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,038
我知道那样做你会不乐意  不过
I know it's strictly your domain, but...

57
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,067
我相信他们愿意买单
They will. I'm sure they will.

等着看谁会重振旗鼓

我们不断听到一个名字  海森堡

72
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:20,072
可能他会是下一个大毒枭
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

73
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,016
还是有人在秘密制造
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking

74
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,057
那些我们追查的冰毒
that big blue we keep finding.

75

它们追踪上千英里
Some of those suckers travel thousands of miles

80
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,058

00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,062
听上去像是升职
Like one hell of a promotion.

现在刚开始  我希望你能

整幢独立式别墅
Detached and all,

卧室 
Bedroom.

156
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,065
很棒
Nice.

157
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,061
我很喜欢硬木地板
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

158
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,024
这么说  你有兴趣
So? You're interested?

159
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,094
毫无疑问
Definitely.

160
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,049
那你也接受NPNS
And you're good with NPNS?

161
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,078
对不起  你说什么
Sorry. What?

162
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,059
广告上说的  不准吸烟  不准养宠物
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.

163
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,034
你要吸烟就到外面去吸
You want to smoke, you do it outside.

164
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:16,053
-可以  不用担心  -按照惯例
- It's cool. No worries. - The usual drill.

165
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,049
W-2: 美国雇员必须填写的文件  包括年收入和缴纳的税

166
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,049
我要W-2表  最近的收入证明和雇主信息
I'll need a W-2 or a recent pay stub, current employer,

167
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,042
还有以前的地址什么的资料
Former address, you know, the yadda-yadda.

168
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:25,093
如果都没问题  我会打电话通知你
And if it's all copasetic, I'll call.

169
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,014
听我说
Look,

170
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,079
情况是  我可以
The thing is I can...

171
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,084
简直难以置信
Unbelievable.

172
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,099
最近我正处在过渡阶段
I'm currently in-between situations.

173
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,012
那我最近不准备出租
And I'm currently not renting.

174
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,062
我有钱  有能力付房租
I got the money and I'm totally good for it

175
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,073
一直都会有
For, like, ever.

176
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,064
别这样  唷  求你了  
Come on, yo, can you please,

177
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,060
就当是帮帮兄弟吧
Please just help a brother out?

178
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,043
唷  我老爸可没这么好说话
Yo, my dad's not really a "make exceptions" kind of guy.

179
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:51,078
-相信我  -你老爸
- Trust me. - Your dad?

180
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:54,014
房子是我老爸的  我帮他打理
Owns the place. I manage it.

181
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,004
我要的是白纸黑字
Pen on paper, that's what I need.

182
00:16:57,026 --> 00:16:59,026
否则你就到别的地方玩去
Or go run your game somewhere else.

183
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:01,066
别傻了  我无处可去了  这里就是我的家
Dude, I got nowhere else to go. This is it.

184
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,072
我真的没有骗你  相信我好吗
And I got no game, all right?

185
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,018
我只需要一个机会
I just need a chance.

186
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:13,065
我的家人把我赶了出来
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

187
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,062
很明显  我不太长进
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

188
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,088
再一次让他们失望了
Didn't meet their expectations, again.

189
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:22,088
所以我现在  无家可归了
So, you know, now I'm "gratis" or whatever.

190
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:23,046
但是知道吗  
But you know what?

191
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:27,024
我是个好人  工作努力
I'm a good person and I work hard.

192
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,082
我会每个月都准时付房租的
I will pay you every month and I will pay you on time.

193
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,029
我不会搞砸的  我发誓
I will not mess this up, okay? I swear.

194
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,017
现在租金涨价了
Rent just went up.

195
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:45,037
一个月多付一百
A hundred more a month.

196
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,004
那是现金价
That's the cash price.

197
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:52,087
你酷毙了  你不会后悔的
You rock. You won't regret this.

198
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,066
还有除了第一个和最后一个月
And, in addition to first and last,

199
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,005
我还想要你先多付两个月
I want two more months.

200
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,061
DBAA费用  恕不退款
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

201
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,042
当然  DBAA  当然没问题 
Of course. No problem. DBAA. Obviously.

202
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,033
什么是DBAA
What's DBAA?

203
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,036
-"别做讨厌的人"  -我懂了
- "Don't be an asshole." - Gotcha.

204
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,054
我就住在隔壁
I live next door.

205
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,069
真的吗
Really?

206
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,029
别以为你有权利霸占着房子
And don't think for one second you have squatters' rights,

207
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,001
它不属于你
Because you don't.

208
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,087
如果你搞砸了  你就得马上滚蛋
If you blow this, I want you gone.

209
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,015
我了解你们这些人  我会把你一脚踹出门
I know guys that'll have your skinny ass

210
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:24,009
然后把东西扔出去  你连眼睛都来不及眨
Out back by the dumpster faster than you can blink.

211
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,042
我会帮你搞定这些  签名就行
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

212
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,042
顺便问问  你叫什么
Which is what, by the way?

213
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,067
杰西
It's Jesse.

214
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:36,082
杰西·杰克逊
Jesse Jackson.

215
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,075
真的吗
Seriously?

216
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,021
怎么了
What?

217
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:34,012
-你在干什么  -享受生活  还能干什么
- What are you doing? - Beating off. What's it look like?

218
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:37,072
我看到的确实是这样
That is, in fact, exactly what it looks like to me.

219
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,054
酿酒是一种艺术  玛丽
Brewing is an art form, Marie.

220
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,088
希望你也能懂得欣赏
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

221
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:43,050
这可是06年圣诞节的一批  快尝尝
Christmas, the batch of '06? Come on.

222
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,016
好吧  我直说吧
So, let me get this straight.

223
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,080
你居然请了病假躲在这里
You call in sick the day after receiving

224
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,067
还是在得到了梦寐以求的升职以后
A long-awaited career-boosting promotion

225
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,094
就为了在这里喝酒寻开心
So you can play October fest in your man cave?

226
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,046
我真的不明白  不懂
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

227
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,094
宝贝儿  放松点
Babe, relax.

228
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:06,065
别让我放松
Please, don't tell me to relax.

229
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:08,094
-你知道我讨厌听到这话  -没错
- You know I hate that. - Right.

230
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,094
戴夫说我应该说出来
Dave said I should express that.

231
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:13,066
我想说的是一切都很好
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

232
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,008
我就想放天假
I can take a day.

233
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,058
没什么大不了的
No big deal.

234
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:22,009
现在  我可爱的小宝贝儿快走吧
Now, get that sweet ass out of here

235
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,025
不然我没法集中精力
So I can concentrate.

236
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:13,099
好吧  计划是什么
Okay, so what's the plan?

237
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:16,069
计划就是我们制毒
The plan is we cook.

238
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,013
我们为什么还要制毒
Why are we cooking

239
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,073
现在根本卖不出去
When we can't even move what we cook?

240
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,045
你觉得靠你自己能卖出去多少
Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own?

241
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:36,079
假设我白天制毒  你晚上去卖的话
Say if I cooked during the days and you worked the nights.

242
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,073
-傻瓜  -什么
- Dude. - What?

243
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,089
在屠库之前  那不是你的想法吗
Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it?

244
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,049
我知道这比我们之前赚的少多了
I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before,

245
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,060
但我们还有别的选择吗
But still, what choice do we have?

246
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,090
首先  别说什么我们
First of all, there's no "we."

247
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,063
你说的是我  一个人单干
You're talking me, solo,

248
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:53,019
在外面苦干还要担心吃子弹
Busting hump slinging shards.

249
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,086
我现在有案底了
I got profile now.

250
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:58,023
你不懂吗  有个禁毒署的家伙盯上我了
Don't you get that? A D.E.A.'s up my ass.

251
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,038
我可不会为了那点小钱
I'm not exposing myself

252
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,054
把自己暴露了
to that level of risk for chump change.

253
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:04,013
-没门  -那你想怎么样
- No way. - Then what do you suggest?

254
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,050
我想我们谁
I don't think either of us are eager

255
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,092
都不会再想和屠库这样的家伙合作了
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

256
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,018
我现在有经济压力
I got bills, man.

257
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,031
你会有经济负担
You've got bills?

258
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,041
房租  唷  有责任了
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

259
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,083
我失去的远比得到的多 
I've already lost more than I have made,

260
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,004
我厌倦了整天在这儿胡搞乱来的日子
And I am tired of dicking around out here.

261
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,087
想知道我失去了多少吗
You want to know how much I've got left?

262
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:30,077
我第一轮的治疗结束了以后
After completing my first round of treatment

263
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:34,042
为世界上最贵的不在场证明买单
And financing the world's most expensive alibi?

264
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,056
什么都没了  都没了
Zero! Zip! Nothing!

265
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,091
之前的一切都付诸东流
I've got nothing to show for all of this.

266
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:40,032
一分钱都没能留给家人
Nothing for my family, which,

267
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,014
要是你还记得的话  那才是该死的重点
As you might remember, was the damn point!

268
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,034
但是现在认输并不是好主意
But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option,

269
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,049
现在只有两条路可选
That leaves us with a total of two choices.

270
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,059
要么再和另一个杀人疯子做生意
We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic

271
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,089
要么你和我开始
Or you and I start...

272
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:03,007
你尽你所能卖货
You selling whatever you can.

273
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,025
还有第三种选择
There's a third way.

274
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:11,058
是什么
And what would that be?

275
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,003
我们自己做屠库
We got to be Tuco.

276
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,012
省掉中间商  我们自己做经销
Cut out the middle man. Run our own game.

277
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:23,026
那你要怎么做
So you're going to, what?

278
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,035
用把猎刀把病毒吸进鼻子吗
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

279
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:29,038
把反对你的人都往死里打
You gonna beat your homies to death when they dis you?

280
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,031
听我说  我认识几个人
Look, I know some guys. All right?

281
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:33,073
我可以建立销售网络
I can create a network.

282
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:38,038
我们自己控制生产和分销
We control production and distribution.

283
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,070
我们从第一线退下来
That way, we stay off the front lines

284
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,084
不要自己去冒险
while moving some serious glass.

285
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:44,055
关键是能赚钱  对吗
The point here is to make money, right?

286
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:46,079
赚大把大把的钱
Sky-high stacks.

287
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,033
-难道我说的不对吗  -不是我不想这么干
- That's not the point? - No, I am not willing to do that.

288
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,063
谁说那关你的事了
Who said anything about you?

289
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,003
我不同意这个计划
I don't vote for this plan.

290
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:05,071
我不喜欢不认识的人加入我们的生意
I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown enties into our operation.

291
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:08,046
你没有投票的权利
You don't get to vote.

292
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:12,012
你再说一遍
I beg your pardon?

293
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,006
我们可是合作伙伴  记得吗
This is a partnership, remember?

294
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,024
我记得
I remember.

295
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:19,031
你制毒  我卖毒
You cook, I sell.

296
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:22,087
我们一开始就是这么分工的
That was the division of labor when we started all this.

297
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,038
现在也该这么保持下去
And that's exactly how we should have kept it.

298
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:27,099
这样我肯定不会让自己被锁在卡车里
'Cause I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk

299
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,062
还要被抢指着跪在地上等死
or on my knees with a gun to my head

300
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,074
在你这贪婪的老头来之前都不会
Before your greedy old ass came along, all right?

301
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,014
好吧  我承认还要学着慢慢来
All right, I will admit to a bit of a learning curve.

302
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:47,060
可能我是太有野心了
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.

303
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:50,087
但无论如何  不会再发生了
But in any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore.

你们加油干
All right? Apply yourselves.

379
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,098
那就是个龌龊的角落
It's an armpit.

380
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,035
不是龌龊的角落
It's not an armpit.

381
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:29,044
对不起  你说得对 
Excuse me. You're right.

382
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,054
那里是西南方的巴黎之城
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

383
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:34,014
看在上帝的份上  那可是德克萨斯啊
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

384
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,035
就在没有王法的墨西哥边境上
Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell.

385
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,012
人头  他们会在那里扔人头
Human heads, they leave.

386
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:43,042
大毒枭们  会在那里抛尸  
The cartels, they litter the place with human heads.

387
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,061
这就是派我去那里的原因
Pretty sure that's why I'm going there.

388
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:51,059
好像还应该大肆宣传庆祝一样  
It's like a calling card or a shout-out or something.

389
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,088
要是华盛顿的话  我还能跟着一起去
Now, D.C., on the other hand, I could get behind.

390
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,072
你在那里埋头苦干

There's just so much, I don't know,

397
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:31,023
文化气息
culture there.

398
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:33,091
我和汉克上司的妻子梅琳达谈过
I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife.

399
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:36,059
那个留着钢盔头  永远画着唇线的女人
The one with the helmet hair and the permanent lip liner.

400
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,022
总之  她对我说
Anyway, she was saying that...

401
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,095
道歉吧
Apologize.

402

What?

403
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,087
我不想
I will not listen

404

再多听一个字
To one more word

405
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,000
除非你先道歉
Until you apologize.

406
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,006
为了什么
For?

407
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,059
你心里清楚着呢  玛丽
You know perfectly well, Marie.

408
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,087
-很明显  我完全  -你撒谎了
- Well, obviously I don't... - Your lies.

409
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,006
对我说谎了
to me.

410
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,058
在商店里顺手牵羊
The shoplifting?

411
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:12,038
所有的一切
All of it?

412
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:15,062
难道你真的以为
Did you really think it was all just

413
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:17,046
这一切都能就这样算了吗
neatly gonna go away?

414
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:21,035
如果不是你硬要还回去的话
If you hadn't tried to return it...

415
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,013
道歉
Apologize.

416
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,072
这是你最后的机会  我是认真的
Now or never. I mean it.

417
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,066
否则我们就一刀两断
Or it'll never be the same.

418
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:36,059
为什么这样惩罚我
Why are you punishing me?

419
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:40,033
如果你完全不尊重我
If you don't respect me

420
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:43,088
不想道歉的话  那就告诉我实话
Enough to apologize, to tell me the truth, then...

421
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,036
我想找回以前的妹妹
I need my sister back.

422
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:10,074
对不起
I'm sorry.

423

对不起
I'm sorry.

你想要听血淋淋的细节吗
You want the gory details?

425
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,089
不  你不会想听的
No, you don't.

426
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,058
会让你睡不着的
Keep you up at night.

427
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,011
那么
So...

428
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:39,068
当时吓人吗
Was it scary?

429
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,082
非常恐怖  年轻人
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary, you little punk.

430
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:44,039
老天啊
Jesus.

431
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:46,095
但你开枪比他快
But you were way faster than him.

432
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:49,045
我还在这里  不是吗
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

433
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:54,053
你揍扁他  还出名了
Hell, yeah. Kick ass and take names.

434
00:33:54,053 --> 00:33:56,091
-儿子  -不用  没事
- Son. - Nah, it's fine.

435
00:33:58,047 --> 00:33:59,088
你知道是什么感觉吗
You know what it is?

436
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:03,050
一个蟑螂从冰箱底下爬出来  你怎么办
A cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do?

437
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,004
你根本不用想
I mean, you don't think about it.

438
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,074
你会打死它们
You stop them down.

439
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,040
他们怎么会变成那样
Where do they come from?

440
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,084
我是说罪犯  像你打死的那个
Criminals, like the one you...

441
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:20,054
你觉得是什么原因让他们变成了罪犯
What do you think it is that makes them who they are.

442
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,091
伙计  你最好问我关于蟑螂的问题
Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches.

443
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:30,017
我所知道的就是有一大群的罪犯
All I know is there's a whole armada.

444
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,067
伙计  我去撒个尿
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

445
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:50,033
警察
Cops!

446
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,059
我不肯定是你
I wasn't sure it was you.

447
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,035
新车吗
New car?

448
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,072
东西放在厢式车上了
Keeping things on the D.L.

449
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,067
我猜你的办法不奏效吧
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.

450
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:10,065
你那份
Your half.

451
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:14,039
15000  我承诺过的
15K. That's what I'm talking about.

452
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:18,075
不用客气
You're welcome.

453
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,044
上帝啊
Jesus.

454
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,094
帮我做做算术  好吗
Help me understand the math, okay?

455
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:27,026
我给了你一磅  对吗
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

456
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:30,069
每盎司  你和我平分2000
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

457
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:34,057
每人1000  1磅也就是16盎司
$1,000 each. 1 pound, that's 16 ounces.

458
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:39,063
16盎司应该是16000才对
16 ounces should net to me $16,000.

459
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,062
是16
16,

460
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,072
不是15
Not 15.

461
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,071
出了点状况
Something came up.

462
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,043
出了状况
Something came up?

463
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:51,031
我的一个人被一帮吸毒的困住了
One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies.

464
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:56,001
损失了一盎司  但还好瘦子皮特没事
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool.

465
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:00,029
所以你的意思是
So you're saying that

466
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:03,082
你的人被抢劫了  或者说  你被抢劫了
Your guy got robbed. Or, rather, you got robbed,

467
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:06,034
但是没关系
But it doesn't matter.

468
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:10,033
傻瓜  那个叫损耗  
Dude, it's called "breakage," okay?

469
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:12,071
就像大超市  货品总会有损耗
Like K-Mart. Shit breaks.

470
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,092
而且你觉得这些都可以接受
And you're thinking this is acceptable?

471
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:18,004
这就是做生意的代价  唷
It's the cost of business, yo.

472
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:20,005
你要为了1000块跟我烦吗
You're sweating me over a grand?

473
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:21,037
我只是个化学家
Look, I'm just the chemist, here.

474
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:23,052
我可不是街上的小混混  唷
I'm not the street guy, yo.

475
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,077
对我来说你所谓的损耗
But it seems to me that what you call "breakage"

476
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:30,013
只是让自己看起来像傻子
Is just you making a fool of yourself.

477
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:33,032
我还要送你另一个专业术语
I've got another technical term for you.

478
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,019
不可持续的商业模式
"Non-sustainable business model."

479
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,027
你只看到了负面
You're focusing on the negative.

480
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:42,087
我们每天赚6000块  你还有什么问题
Six grand a day we're making. What's your problem?

481
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:45,043
消息泄露了怎么办
What happens when word gets out,

482
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:48,043
你雇的小丑可不会小心谨慎
And it's open season on these clowns you've hired?

483
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:52,021
一旦每个人都知道了杰西·平克曼
Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman,

484
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:56,005
大毒枭  被打劫了也不出声
Drug lord, can be robbed with impunity...

485
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,089
伙计  算了吧
Man, come on.

486
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,098
你以为屠库那样的人会有损耗吗
You think Tuco had breakage?

487
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:06,058
他确实会有  他会打断别人的骨头
I guess it's true, he did. He broke bones.

488
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:09,085
他会把在他地盘撒野的人头都拧碎
He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.

489
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,029
你还想要1000吗  是不是
You want another grand? Is that it?

490
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:15,054
-不是我想要说的  -拿着  给
- Not my point. - Take it. Here.

491
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,094
你现在有15000  昨天你还什么都没有
Look, you got 15,000 you didn't have yesterday.

492
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:24,044
我们在赚钱  总会有些情况
We're making bank. Shit happens.

493
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:27,023
我的人知道要怎么做  他们非常小心
My guys get what they're up against, and they're careful.

494
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,063
我也一样
So am I.

495
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:31,054
你就坐在家里好吃好喝共享天伦吧
And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family.

496
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,054
别再像怪人一样想这想那了
So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?

497
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:37,027
你的分工非常明确
You've made the division of labor very clear.

498
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:42,018
唷  说真的
Yo, I mean, seriously.

499
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:44,067
你到底想我怎么样
What the hell do you want me to do?

500
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,021
对不起
Sorry.

501
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,040
你溜进来了
You snuck in.

502
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:19,031
我都不知道你回家了
Didn't even know you were home.

503
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,065
你在吃什么
What you eating?

504
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:26,001
三明治  想吃的话冰箱里还有一个
A panini. There's another one in the freezer if you want it.

505
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:29,011
我以为我们从不吃那些东西
I thought we nixed those, huh?

506
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:35,080
我是说  那些不是低钠的吧
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones with the off-the-chart sodium?

507
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,039
我突然很想吃
I had a craving.

508
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:40,096
难得吃一次没什么大不了的
Once in a while is no big deal.

509
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,085
小沃尔特去哪里了
So where's Junior?

510
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:50,070
出去了
Out.

511
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,070
和谁
With whom?

512
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,010
去哪里了
Out where?

513
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,088
某个地方吧  我不知道
Somewhere. I don't know.

514
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,070
晚上9点之前会回来
He'll be back by 9:00.

515
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:14,069
我还以为你会对儿子的去向有所了解
I just thought you might have a clue where your son is.

516
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,075
那你为什么不知道
Why don't you?

517
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,032
为什么总是我一个人来关心他去哪里
Why am I the only one who needs to keep track of our son?

518
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,062
告诉你  沃尔特  你想知道就自己去问
I'll tell you what, Walt. You want to know where he is, ask him.

519
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:27,088
像我一样打电话给他
Just pick up the phone like I do.

520
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:47,033
可能你会知道
Perhaps you might know something...

521
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,028
这个
About this.

522
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:54,036
可能
Perhaps.

523
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,055
但也可能
And then again,

524
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:00,026
我不知道  沃尔特
Perhaps I don't, Walt

525
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,002
可能我梦游时抽过
Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.

526
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,002
我想要你解释一下
I'd like an explanation.

527
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,003
-你不会想再说下去  -你为什么要抽烟
- You really don't want to go down... - Why would you do this?

528
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,076
看在上帝的份上  你还怀着孕
You're pregnant, for God's sakes.

529
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,001
三根半香烟

531
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,088
-不会怎么样的  -很高兴你这么肯定  医生
- Nothing. - I'm glad you're so sure, Doctor.

532
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,077
三根半  就这么多  剩下的都扔了
Three and a half. That was it. I tossed the rest.

533
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:24,060
你肯定很想听到这个
And I'm sure you'll be very glad to hear that, yes,

534
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,009
没错  我感到羞耻
Yes, I feel ashamed.

535
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:33,066
斯凯勒  做这样的事
Skyler, This is something that...

536
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:37,078
-一点都不像你  -真的吗
- This is so unlike you. - Oh, really?

537
00:43:38,027 --> 00:43:39,092
你怎么会知道
How would you know?

538
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,080
不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

539

你问我想要你怎么做
You had asked me what I want you to do.

00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,095
我想你把这个处理掉
I want you to handle it.
