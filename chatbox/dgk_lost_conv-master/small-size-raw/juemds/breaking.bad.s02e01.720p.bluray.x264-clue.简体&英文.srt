这啥玩意儿  怎么是蓝的
What is this? It's blue.

14
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:54,016
我们改了下化学制程  不过纯度还是一样的
We used a different chemical process,but it is every bit as pure.

15
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,008
别看它是蓝的  吸着一样赞
May be blue, but it's the bomb.

你们好好干  大家一起挣大钱
You're all right. We're gonna make a lot of money together.

20
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,016
给我记住你们在给谁干活
Just remember who you're working for.

21
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,077
你说什么
What did you say?

22
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:36,012
我就告诉他们  该明白他们在替你干活
I'm just saying, they gotta know that they're working for you.

23
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,083
你以为他们不明白吗
Like they don't already know that?

24
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,066
你是说他们很蠢是吧
Are you saying that they're stupid?

25
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,090
没有  我就说说而已
No, I'm just saying.

26
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,017
所以你不是在说他们蠢
Oh yeah, so you're not saying that they're stupid?

27
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,079
那我就不明白了  你是在说我蠢吗
So, I don't understand.Are you saying that I'm stupid?

28
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,083
是吗
Is that it?

29
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,080
是不是这个意思
Is that what you're doing?

我们大家都...
Why don't we all just...

32
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,016
放松一下
Relax?

33
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,026
海森堡说了  放松一下
Heisenberg says, "relax."

34
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,059
我很放松  我很放松
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

35
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,009
我非常放松
I'm relaxed...

Damn, man!Look at that! Look!

37
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:39,089
真他妈混蛋
Yeah. That's messed up.

38
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,025
行了  海森堡
Okay, Heisenberg!

00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,069
下周见
Next week.

40
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,093
考虑到通货膨胀
Adjusting for inflation...

41
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,021
好的州立大学  考虑到通货膨胀影响
Good state college,adjusting for inflation,

42
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,041
算它4万5千一年  两个孩子  上四年大学
Say $45,000 a year.Two kids, four years of college,

43
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,078
那就是36万
$360,000.

44
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,010
房贷还有10万7没还
Remaing mortgage on the home,107 thousand.

45
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:59,059
加上房贷利息3万  一共是13万7
Home equity line, 30 thousand.That's 137 thousand.

46
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,096
生活费

吃的  穿的  水电煤气什么的

48
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,096
算它每月两千
Say two grand a month,

49
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:10,008
其实还可以少算点的
And that should put a dent in it,anyway.

50
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,052
一年就是2万4
24K a year.

51
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,009
按十年来算
Provide for say,10 years.

52
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:21,081
就是24万  加上36万  再加13万7
That's $240,000.Plus 360, plus 1, 3, 7...

53
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,038
73万7

54
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,050
我一共需要73万7
$737,000.That is what I need.

55
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,066
就是这个数
That's what I need.

56
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:37,055
你跟我每周各净赚7万
You and I both clear about 70 grand a week,

57
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,074
那就只要再干10个半礼拜  算它11
That's only 10 and a half More weeks.Call it 11...

58
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:44,092
再干11单买卖  只在公共场所交易
11 more drug deals, and always in a public place from now on.

59
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,097
可行的  绝对可行的
It's do-able.Definitely do-able.

60
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,047
海森堡
Heisenberg!

61
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,058
到底怎么了  他怎么回事
What the hell?What's wrong with him?

62
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,014
你他妈怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

63
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,003
这么不经揍是吧  妈的
You can't take an ass-beating,bitch?

64
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,090
-情况不妙  屠库  -闭嘴
- Damn, Tuco... - Shut up.

65
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,066
脉搏停掉了
There's no pulse.

66
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,044
-干点什么啊  -我能干什么啊
- Do something.- Do something?

67
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,007
该叫救护车把他送医急救
He needs an ambulance.He needs a hospital.

68
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,059
干点什么  你不是很聪明的吗
Do something!You're smart, right?

69
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,048
给他做  做那个
Do that... Do that thing!

70
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,074
没有  没什么用
No, there's... There's nothing.

71
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:14,001
-给他人工呼吸  -早就不推荐用这招了
- Breathe into his mouth... - No, they don't teach that anymore.

72
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:15,088
-没有用的  -你  过来
- It doesn't work. - You, come here!

73
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,093
给他做人工呼吸
Breathe into his mouth!

74
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:22,093
别动
No

75
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,099
把他处理掉
Get rid of him.

76
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,034
老大  我们不能这么对他
We can't do him like that, man.

77
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,020
不能像处理掉个秃鹰或老鼠什么的
Buzzards and rats and all that.

78
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:11,021
我是说  我们可是基督教徒  不能这么干的
I'm just saying, you know?It's not very Christian.

79
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,025
你这是在违抗命令吗
It sounds like arguing.

80
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:50,000
怪诞  快点
Gonzo, hurry up!

81
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:12,008
这么急着走干嘛
What's the big hurry?

82
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,020
我只是以为  这儿没我们什么事了
I just think we're done here.

83
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,001
好吧  你们完事儿了
Well...you're done.

84
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,048
我在后边呢
Hey, I'm back here!

85
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:08,026
有人吗
Hello?

86
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:43,086
沃尔特  听到我讲话了吗
Walt...Didn't you hear me?

87
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:51,008
沃尔特
Walt...

88
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:54,065
沃尔特
Walt...

89
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,056
淡定
Hey, yourself.

90
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,012
我叫你的时候你不能答应一声吗
What, you can't answer when I'm calling you?

91
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,033
你还好吧
Are you okay?

92
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,055
很好
Great.

93
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,076
新帽子
New hat?

94
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,093
我在艾伯森食品店买了点烤鸡
I got some grilled chicken at Albertson's.

95
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,065
要帮你热一下吗
You want me to heat some up for you?

96
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,010
你去哪了
Where've you been?

97
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,067
你看看  我脸上还涂着这玩意儿
Do you know what,I've got all this crap on my face.

98
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,084
让我先洗掉吧  好吗
Let me clean up first, okay?

99
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,059
小沃尔特随时会回来  所以
You know, Walter Junior's gonna be home any minute, so...

100
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,034
好吧  好  够了
Ok just...enough.

101
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,085
等一下
Hold up.

102
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,029
停下
Stop it.

103
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:50,021
停下
Stop it!

104
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:46,005
我知道你心里害怕
I know you're scared,

105
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:50,025
你愤怒又沮丧  我也知道老天对你不公
And you're angry,and you're frustrated.And I know none of this is fair.

106
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:55,036
但你不能拿我出气
But you cannot take it out on me.

107
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,098
我回来了
Hey, I'm home!

108
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,046
我们死定了
We are dead.

109
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,096
死定了
Dead, man!

110
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,069
挂了  完了  不管你TM怎么说
Muerto! Ormuerte! However the hell you...

111
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,008
-别疑神疑鬼的  -我疑神疑鬼
- This is conjecture. - This is conjecture?

112
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,089
是的  瞎猜是没有用的
Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.

113
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,058
我在瞎猜吗  好吧
My conjecture isn't helping. Fine.

114
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,042
给我听着  首先
Facts then. Fact A:

115
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,099
我的电话  昨晚响了七八次
My phone rang, like, eight times last night.

116
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:40,004
每次都不说话  接起来就挂了
Dead air, hang ups every time.

117
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,012
第二
Second fact:

118
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:42,085
凌晨三点  我看到他那辆黑色卡迪拉克
3 in the morning, I saw that black Caddy

119
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,022
在这附近转悠  没打灯
Of his cruising my neighborhood.No headlights.

120
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:45,076
如果他真想杀我们
If he wanted to kill us,

121
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,089
在废车场那会早就动手了
He would've done it at the junkyard.

122
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,088
你那算什么  瞎猜
What is that? Conjecture?

123
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,091
你有啥根据  你是觉得他脑筋正常
Are you basing that on that he's got a normal,

124
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,061
还是怎么的
healthy brain or something?

125
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:57,068
没看到他打死个人  一点不当回事吗
Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing?

126
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:02,029
还有  还有他死瞪着我们说
And that way... that way he just kept staring at us,saying,

127
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,024
你们完事儿了
"You're done."

128
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,031
什么叫你们完事儿了
"You're done"?

129
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,092
你想知道吗  我来告诉你那什么意思
You wanna know what that means?I will tell you what that means.

130
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,084
那就是说你们玩完了
That means exactly how it sounds, yo!

131
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,073
这下好了  我们是目击证人  需要好好收拾
All right. We are witnesses.We are loose ends.

132
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:17,011
现在  屠库正想着  是啊
Right now, Tuco's thinking,"Yeah, hey,

133
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,054
他们的货做得不错  但他们可信吗
"they cook good meth,but can I trust them?"

134
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:25,096
当他觉得咱不可信的时候他会怎么着
What happens when he decides no?

135
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:40,041
不是他死就是我们亡  明白吗  你自己选吧
It's him or us! You understand?It is him or us!

136
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:52,043
你想怎么做
How would you do it?

137
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,052
-什么意思  -你的具体计划
- What do you mean? - Specifically,

138
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:57,013
你想怎么做  一步一步说
How would you do it? Step by step.

139
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,047
好吧
All right.

140
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,051
我们可以这样...
Say we...

141
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,057
再安排一次交易  
Set up one last sale, this is providing

142
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,060
只要他不在此之前废了我们
He doesn't decide to waste us before then.

143
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,010
每次我们带了新货  他总会
Every time we bring in a new batch,he always...

144
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,048
先验货对吧  所以
Tests the product, right? So,

145
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,099
趁他低头  深吸一口的时候  砰  砰  砰
As his head is down...you know, just giving it a snort...

146
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,007
砰  砰  砰  三枪搞定吗
So three shots?

147
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,095
-三枪  我不知道  或者两枪  -到底两枪还是三枪
- Three shots, or, I don't know, two.- But is it two, or is it three?

148
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,019
-也许两枪就够了  -两枪  打胸口
- Two would probably work, I guess. - Two shots in the chest?

149
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:27,091
-还是打脸  -拜托
- Or in the face? - Come on...

150
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,071
我只想搞清楚到底怎么才行
I'm just trying to understand how this works.

151
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,007
好吧  这个晚点再议  不过在此之前
All right. We'll providing in that.But by now,

152
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,009
那个大块头  怪诞  他会对付你  是吧
The big guy, Gonzo... he's probably coming at you, right?

153
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:43,061
然后你瞄准他  对他要开几枪
So you turn toward him...How many shots for him?

154
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,099
他块头很大  是吧  对他得开几枪才行呢
He's a big guy, right?How many shots does that take?

155
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:48,037
-我不知道  三枪吧  -好的  三枪
- I don't know. Three shots. - Okay, three shots.

156
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,048
屠库和怪诞  这两个干掉了  那么  还有别人吗
Tuco and Gonzo. Two men down.Now, is there anyone else there?

157
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,097
我是说  屠库通常都会带上其他人  是吧
I mean, Tuco is usually with someone else, right?

158
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,055
可能会带好几个  他的同伙  手下
Maybe even a couple of guys.His dealers, his posse.

159
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,085
好吧
All right.

160
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,087
这个我们也暂且不论
So we'll put a pin in that one, too.

161
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,023
现在  你一共开了几枪了
Now, at this point,how many shots have been fired?

162
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:16,016
子弹还有剩吗  你那枪能装几颗子弹
You've gotta be running low.How many bullets does that gun take?

163
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,091
你连个弹匣都打不开
How can you suggest

164
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:37,090
还想用这去杀人
That we kill a man and you can't even open the gun?

165
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,020
没那么容易  是吧
It's not that easy, is it?

166
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,056
拜托  沃尔特  你就杀过
Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

167
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,042
呼叫斯凯勒
Call Skyler.

168
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:18,002
你好  这里是沃尔特  斯凯勒  小沃尔特的家

Well, aren't you early bird,up and out already.

171
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,009
我和大笨猪今晚想去试试
The big lug and I are gonna go try

172
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,028
新墨西哥大学那儿新开的餐馆
That new restaurant over by UNM tonight.

173
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:31,013
如果想"嗨皮"就一起吧
So let me know if you guys wanna hang.

174
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,012
听听我说的  "嗨皮"
Listen to me. "Hang."

175

我连这都知道
I know the lingo.

177

还挺时髦的
I'm still hip.

178
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,042
那是家中餐馆
It's Chinese... the restaurant.

179
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:45,016
不知道为什么  我就是喜欢中餐
I don't know.I just feel like Chinese.

180
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:48,008
你觉得中国人
Do you think that people in China

181
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,067
也会喜欢西餐吗
Ever just feel like American?

182
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,094
我是说  他们会不会
You know, and they go out

183
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,090
叫上点外卖
And get little take-out boxes

184
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:58,098
比如土豆泥烤肉饼什么的
With mashed potatoes and meat loaf,

185
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:03,022
他们会不会学着用小刀小叉
And try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks?

186
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,073
我很好奇会不会有这样的事
I wonder if that ever happens.

187
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:08,095
好吧  不废话了  给我回电话
All right. I'll let you go.So call me.

188
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:12,075
斯凯勒没接电话吗
Skyler didn't pick up?

189
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,099
她肯定不在家
Obviously she's not home.

190
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:30,015
你刚说什么中餐馆来着
What was that about Chinese?

191
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,039
就新开的那家  想今晚去吃

You got Dave at 8.

194
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,098
没约今晚啊
Not tonight.

195
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:45,003
-是今晚  记得吗  -不  约的周四
- Yeah, you do. Remember? - No, that's Thursday.

196
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:49,039
肯定是周四
I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.

197
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,049
还记得最后他们怎么为你改期了吗
Remember how, at the last minute,they changed it around for you?

198
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,095
不去的话会罚款的
They were gonna charge us a penalty.

199
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,025
宝贝  只剩下六次治疗了
Look, baby,you only got six more sessions.

200
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:01,038
我会去的  汉克  我说到做到
And I'm doing them, Hank. I said I would do them, and I'm doing them.

201
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:05,001
只是你要是约错了时间  那我就没办法了
I can't help it if you got your days of the week wrong.

202
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,043
小心
Look out!

203
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,031
对不起  施拉德先生
Sorry, Mr. Schrader!

204
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,063
我只是觉得
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

205
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,061
我觉得戴夫真的对你很有帮助
I think Dave is...really helping you.

206
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,051
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

207
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,078
她有点
She's...

208
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,027
我要打电话
Where's my phone call?

209
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,098
沙地上撂倒两个  树林里再撂倒一双
Hits two in the sand,two in the forest.

210
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,052
-然后他说  再来4个凑凑数  -戈麦斯
- And then he says, "Give me a four." - Gomez.

211
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,073
有什么新线索没有
What do you got for me?

212
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:20,070
拿进来  动作要快
Come on. Chop-chop.

213
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,024
这一大早的  催命鬼似的
Good morning to you, too.

214
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:30,039
本地警方送过来的  大概8到10天前的
APD sent this over.This was about eight or ten days ago.

215
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:33,040
-知道西南面那家苯胺厂吧  -离这25公里那家吗  知道
- You know Southwest Aniline, right? - Yeah, off the 25?

216
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:37,005
-那地方老有股脚臭味儿  -看看他们  仔细看
- Whole place smells like feet. - This is them. Check this out.

217
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:42,027
-该死的  这是什么  -铝热剂
- Holy shit. What was that? - Thermite.

218
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,095
他们是这么说的
So they tell me.

219
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,014
燃烧起来大约有5000度
Burns about 5,000 degrees.

220
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:48,025
詹姆士·邦德经常会用到这招
Kind of stuff you see on a James Bond movie.

221
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,067
不错嘛
Nice!

222
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:52,006
这两个家伙挺懂行的嘛
Guys who know their trade.

223
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,028
等等  我收回刚才的话
Wait. I take that back.

224
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,059
他们就没想过顺手偷个手推车吗
What, they didn't think about stealing a hand truck?

225
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:05,012
可以推着走的  笨蛋  那是个桶
Try rolling it, morons!It's a barrel.

226
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:08,052
可以用滚的  老天
It rolls. Jesus.

227
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,082
-他们偷了什么  -30加仑甲胺[约合113多公升]
- So what'd they get? - Methylamine, 30 gallons.

228
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:15,050
苯基丙酮制毒吗
P2P?

229
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,024
他们在用老式的学院派方式制毒
They're cooking old-school biker meth.

230
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:21,051
到底谁TM还在用这办法
Who the hell still does that?

231
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:24,004
我知道的老家伙们死的死抓的抓
All the old-timers I know are either dead or in prison.

232
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:27,013
最近原料短缺
Pseudo's in short supply,

233
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:30,021
所以这俩家伙想改进配方
So these two make do by changing up the formula.

234
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,071
知道这个还有铝热剂
That and the thermite...

235
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,099
不得不承认他们挺懂行的
I'd say these two know their chemistry.

236
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,077
但说到做贼的水平
But ranking them as burglars?

237
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:41,055
三脚猫都不算  连特奥会都轮不上他们
Shit! I wouldn't trust these two to break into the Special Olympics.

238
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:44,042
空有理论知识  没有实战经验
They got book learnin' but no street skills.

239
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,083
也许他们就是学生
Maybe they're college kids...

240
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:48,093
化学系的  想得个高分
Chem students trying to make a big score.

241
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:53,071
我跟你说  整整30加仑的甲胺
I tell you,30 gallons of Precursor...

242
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,091
这分数高的  他们也不怕被人盯上
That big a score, they're gonna wind up stepping on some toes.

243
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,070
要我说
Tell you what,

244
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,035
他们最好祈祷赶紧让我们逮着
They better pray it's us who catches up to them

245
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,040
别给那帮墨西哥佬盯上咯
And not those boys from Juarez.

246
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:32,041
你女儿迫不及待想出来呢
Your daughter wants out.

247
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,073
你好
Hey, there.

248
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:05,096
这里是沃尔特  斯凯勒  小沃尔特的家
You've reached Walt, Skyler,and Walter Junior.

249
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:07,091
现在没法接听您的电话
We can't come to the phone right now,

250
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,098
有事请留言
So please leave us a message.

251
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:12,051
是我
Hey, it's me.

252
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,034
我想这次该早点打给你
I thought I'd try you earlier this time,

253
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:17,086
趁你们还没出去开始新一天的时候
Before you go out and, you know,face the day.

254
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:19,078
我知道
I'm realizing now

255
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,061
你现在接电话肯定要慢好多了
It probably takes you a little longer to get to the phone,

256
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,015
毕竟挺着个大肚子嘛...
Owing to the extra baby weight...

257
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,041
亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

258
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,012
沃尔特  你整个晚上都站在那吗
Walt, did you spend the entire night out here?

259
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,008
没有  不是一整晚
No, no.Well, not all of it.

260
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:49,081
我确实觉得  胃有点痛
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...my stomach, you know?

261
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:54,024
肯定会翻来覆去睡不着  我只是不想吵醒你
I knew I was gonna be up and down,so I just didn't want to wake you.

262
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:23,063
他怎么会知道我住哪的
How would he know where I live?

263
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,020
-你确定那是屠库  -不是他还能是谁
- You're sure it was Tuco? - Who else could it be?

264
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:31,014
你告诉过他我的名字住址什么的吗
Did you ever tell him my name,where I live or anything...

265
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,089
那怪诞呢  死掉的那个呢
What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

266
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,040
-你跟他们说过我什么吗  -一个字都没说过
- Did you tell them anything about me? - I didn't say jack!

267
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:38,037
屠库肯定是想探探你的底
Tuco must've put out,like, you know, feelers.

268
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,019
他自有他的路子和办法
He's got his ways and means, yo.

269
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,019
他有人脉的好吧  他正步步紧逼
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

270
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:50,000
他要是发现我小舅子是缉毒署的  那怎么办
And what happens when he finds out that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

271
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,075
天哪  那怎么办
Oh, God. What happens then?

272
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,036
听着  这里有5颗子弹
Look, it's got five bullets.

273
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:04,040
我总算搞清楚了怎么
I finally figured out how to...

274
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:06,099
总之  我有数了
Look, I just finally...I figured it out.

275
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:09,086
假设我们再去搞把枪给你
Say we get a second gun,right, for you.

276
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:14,006
我们的胜算不是加倍了吗
I mean, don't we, like,double our chances?

277
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,097
我是说  从数量上来看
I mean, mathematically.

278
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:19,080
我有个更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

279
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,097
谢天谢地
Thank God!

280
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:27,024
是什么  怀特先生  快说快说
All right.What is it, Mr. White?Lay it on me.

281
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:31,007
豆子
Beans.

282
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,068
豆子
Beans?

283
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,070
这是蓖麻豆
They're castor beans.

284
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:39,033
这是用来干什么吃的
So what are we gonna do with them?

285
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:42,018
你以为这是《杰克与魔豆》的故事 是吗
Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk, huh?

286
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,075
顺着豆茎往上爬就能逃出生天
Climb it and escape?

287
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,040
我们要用这提炼出蓖麻毒素
We are going to process them into ricin.

288
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:49,092
棺臃?
Rice and beans?

289
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:53,062
蓖麻毒素
Ricin.

290
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:55,096
是种剧毒物质
It's an extremely effective poison.

291
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:57,087
所需剂量很小
It's toxic in small doses.

292
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,056
尸检的时候也很容易被忽略掉
Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy.

293
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:06,046
-好吧  这么说  -别碰它们
- All right.So... - Don't touch them.

294
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:10,080
等等  说真的  你真的能从豆子里提炼出毒来
Wait. Seriously,you can get poison from beans?

295
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:12,062
上个世纪70年代末
Back in the late'70s,

296
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:15,055
蓖麻毒素曾被用来暗杀一名保加利亚记者
Ricin was used to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

297
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,069
克格勃间谍改造了一下伞尖
The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella

298
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:22,008
用它在那人腿上注入了那么一点
To inject a tiny pellet into the man's leg.

299
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,025
我说的一点  还没有针尖那么大
And we're talking about an amount not much bigger than the head of a pin.

300
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,046
-但能杀死他  -当然
- But it killed him? - Oh yes.

301
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,097
现在我们只要想出怎么给他下毒
Now we just need to figure out a delivery device,

302
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,031
然后  就没屠库这个人了
And then...no more Tuco.

303
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,019
最近怎样
How you doing?

304
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:29,073
我来的不是时候吗
Is this...This a bad time?

305
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:34,016
没事  进来吧
No, come on in.

306
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,047
抱歉  我该先打个电话的
I should've called first.I'm sorry.

307
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:48,043
有什么事吗
What can I do for you?

308
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,027
也许我们该...
Maybe we ought...

309
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,032
你想先坐下聊吗
You want to sit down first?

310
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,049
我不知道  汉克
I don't know, Hank.

311
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:03,006
得看你要聊的是不是玛丽的事
Depends on whether or not this is gonna be about Marie.

312
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,035
她让你来的吗
Did she send you?

313
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:09,066
不是的
Hell, no.

314
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,037
她都不怎么跟我讲话了
She's barely even talking to me.

315
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,068
所以我才来找你  好吗
That's why I'm here, okay?

316
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,057
为求自保
Self-preservation.

317
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,089
刻不容缓
Big time.

318
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:27,032
我知道你们姐妹俩时好时坏的
Look,I know you gals have your ups and downs.

319
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,042
-这点我知道  -姐妹俩
- I get it. - Gals...

320
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:33,031
我搅合进来是因为  我也有生理需要的嘛
And I need to get involved like I need a second hole in my ass.

321
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:36,088
看我的面子上  帮我个忙  给她回个电话吧
But if you could do me this huge favor and just return her phone calls.

322
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,045
我还不
I don't...

323
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,095
还不准备理她
Think I'm quite ready to do that yet.

324
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,024
你知道的  沟通  沟通万岁  对吧
You know, communication.Communication, right?

325
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,011
退一步海阔天空  拜托了
The back, the forth.Come on.

326
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:48,015
斯凯勒  看我的面子上  求你了
Sky, do this for me, please.

327
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:49,081
你可以冲她吼几句
You can yell at her.

328
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,070
就回个电话给她吧
Just call her back.

329
00:32:57,092 --> 00:33:01,045
玛丽她入店行窃了  汉克
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

330
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:03,018
就是这样
That's right.

331
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:07,039
记得婴儿送礼会上她送的那个头饰
That "Baby Shower" she gave me at the shower?

332
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:10,032
那是她在圣扎迦利婴儿用品店偷来的
She stole it from Gertrude Zachary's.

333
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:15,035
我去退货的时候差点被抓起来
I almost got arrested when I went back to return it.

334
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,075
玛丽她倒好  她不肯承认
And Marie won't admit it.

335
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:19,019
更不肯道歉
She won't apologize.

336
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:27,015
如果我知道你会去退货的话  我就不会
If I thought you were gonna return it, I would have never..you know.

337
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:36,046
这些你早就知道了
You knew about this?

338
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,095
我们正在想办法
We're working on it.

339
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:42,061
我是说  她去找了个心理治疗师  戴夫
I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.

340
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,092
-戴夫很在行的  -戴夫很在行
- I mean, Dave is really good. - Dave's good.

341
00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:48,088
但这是个渐进的过程  斯凯勒  
But it's an ongoing process, Sky,

342
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,010
我们该理解她
And we have gotta be understanding.

343
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:55,063
我是说  我们该  我们该
You know? I mean, we've gotta... You know. We've gotta...

344
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,092
帮帮她
Support the shit out of her.

345
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,059
-是吗  -是的
- Do we? - Yeah.

346
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:05,063
需要帮助的人是我
I need support.

347
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,038
是我
Me!

348
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:11,006
将近40岁了  意外怀孕
The almost 40-year-old pregnant woman,

349
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,089
挺着这么个大肚子
With the surprise baby on the way.

350
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:15,064
丈夫又得了肺癌
And the husband with the lung cancer

351
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,051
还整天不知所踪  鬼才知道他去哪了
Who disappears for hours on end,and I don't know where he goes,

352
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:21,001
反正他也不怎么跟我说话了
And he barely even speaks to me anymore.

353
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,080
还有个喜怒无常的儿子  跟他老爸一个德性
With the moody son who does the same thing.

354
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,087
存款账户早就透支了
And the overdrawn checking account.

355
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,056
家里的热水器烧不了热水  还总往下漏锈水
And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty-looking crap

356
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,087
储藏柜的底都快给它烂掉了
And is rotting out the floor of the utility closet

357
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,075
我们甚至连修理费都付不起了
And we can't even afford to fix it.

358
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:37,060
但是  我明白
But, oh, I see!

359
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:40,040
现在我该说的是  汉克  求你了
Now I'm supposed to go,"Hank, please.

360
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:43,021
我能做点什么好呢  怎么才能帮上忙
"What can I possibly do to further benefit

361
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,030
我那妹妹  虽然娇生惯养  偷窃成癖
"My spoiled, kleptomaniac bitch sister

362
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,047
但谁让她到哪都是大家关注的焦点呢
"Who somehow always manages to be the center of attention!

363
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,056
老天明鉴  她才是那个
"'Cause God knows she's the one

364
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:55,039
制造麻烦的人呢
"With the really important problems!"

365
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:13,054
要我帮你看看那个储藏柜吗
Want me to take a look at that utility closet?

366
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:47,094
这样就可以了吗
That's all it takes?

367
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:51,016
这样就可以了
That's all it takes.

368
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:54,058
那么  现在怎么办
So, now what?

369
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,057
现在  我们安排下次交易
Now, we arrange our next meet,

370
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,060
这次要找个公共场所  舒适又安全的地方
In a public place this time.Nice and safe.

371
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:03,030
装得若无其事的样子
Business as usual.

372
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,055
跟往常一样  卖给他4磅货
And, uh, after we sell him our usual four pounds,

373
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,070
然后  我们把这个拿出来
Then we'll pull this out.

374
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,004
还有件事  屠库
"By the way, Tuco,

375
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,047
这是我们研制出来的新配方
"The new meth formula we've been working on.

376
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,037
有没有兴趣一试
"Would you care to try it?"

377
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,014
好  那么  新货在哪里
Okay, well, what's new about it?

378
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,000
我是说  以防万一  他问起的话我们怎么说
I mean just in case he asks. What do we say?

379
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:24,012
我不知道  随便扯点什么
I don't know.Whatever you want.

380
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:26,096
就说抽了会爽到颠
It gets the user insanely high.

381
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:29,095
这又不需要什么销售技巧
I mean, how much salesmanship do we really need?

382
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,070
那变态逮到啥都会往鼻子里面吸的
That degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on.

383
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,086
好吧  说辞我们也暂且不论
Okay, well, we'll just put a pin in that, then.

384
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,047
总之  在接下来的48小时内
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,

385
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:42,049
也许72小时
Maybe 72,

386
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:45,021
他会死得像自然死亡那样
It'll look like natural causes.

387
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,028
怎么死  心脏病那样吗
What, like a heart attack?

388
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,028
或者  禽流感什么的
Or the flu, maybe.

389
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:55,054
他的手下不会发现任何异常
His associates won't know any differently,

390
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:57,083
而我们也不会被怀疑
And we'll be in the clear.

391
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,069
只要屠库不先对我们下手
Not if Tuco kills us first.

392
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,099
别出声
Just keep it down.

393
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:22,075
汉克  有事吗
Hey, Hank. What's up?

394
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,087
老兄
Hey, buddy.

395
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:29,030
你回过家了吗
You been home yet?

396
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,076
还没  怎么了
No.Why?

397
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,073
我把事情搞砸了
'Cause I really screwed up.

398
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:41,026
赶在斯凯勒对你大发牢骚之前  我先跟你道歉
I apologize in advance for the earful you're gonna hear from Skyler.

399
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,049
我本意是想让她和玛丽合好如初
I'm just trying to get her and Marie talking again.

400
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,077
我大错特错了  我就不该卷进去的
Big mistake.I should have just kept out of it.

401
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,051
好的  没事
Yeah, well, okay.

402
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,058
我真是个大嘴巴
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

403
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:55,058
你也不是有意的  没问题的  别担心了
Well, that happens.It's no problem.No worries.

404
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,084
谢谢你  兄弟  我很感激
Well, thanks, man.I appreciate that.

405
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:01,030
真是的  这些女人哪
Jesus, the wives, huh?

406
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:03,022
汉克  很不巧
Hank, unfortunately,

407
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:06,089
-我真的得  -不好意思  我就不耽误你了
- I really... - Oh, yeah, man, don't let me keep you.

408
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:10,002
事实上  我也在忙呢
Actually, I'm at work, so...

409
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:14,073
对了  想开开眼戒吗
You wanna see something really freaky?

410
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:17,080
-我倒是想  只是  -说真的  沃尔特  这简直是
- Well, I would, but... - Seriously, Walt, this is...

411
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,020
我和格米就在这个凶案现场呢  你真该见识一下  等等
You gotta check out this crime scene me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

412
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:32,028
先别挂  照片马上就发过去了
Hang on, hang on.It should be coming through right now.

413
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,080
没你想象得那么糟吧
Guess it could be worse, huh?

414
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:38,082
说不定哪天我们也跟这俩家伙一样了
We could be having a day like these two.

415
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:42,004
两个本地帮派的冲头
A couple of local bulletheads.

416
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:45,016
估计是惹错人了
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

417
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:49,040
沃尔特  你在听吗
Walt, you there?

418
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:02,066
-我得拿着这个  -不行  这是我的枪  我需要它
- I'm taking this. - No! It's my gun! I need it!

419
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,024
不  你逃得远远的就不需要枪了
No, you don't!Not if you leave town.

420
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:05,035
快离开这儿  
Get out of here

421
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:08,001
屠库既然杀了怪诞  下一个肯定会来找我们 
Tuco killing Gonzo means he's coming after us next.

422
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,059
我得先回家  我有家人要顾
I've gotta get home. My family.

423
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,068
无翻译

424
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,069
无翻译

425
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,039
小沃尔特去哪了
Where's Walter Junior?

426
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:06,008
估计是去路易斯家吃晚饭去了
Having dinner at Louis's house.Supposedly.

427
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:11,046
整整一天  我一个人守着这个空房子
All day, I've had the whole house to myself.

428
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,043
这次  你又去哪了
So where have you been this time?

429
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,096
沃尔特  过来跟我说说话好吗
Walt, will you come in here and talk to me please?

430
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:16,098
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

431
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,085
我认得这两个家伙
I recognize these two knobjobs.

432
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:33,055
他们是屠库·塞拉曼加这个变态的手下
Known associates of a psychotic piece of shit named Tuco Salamanca.

433
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,079
-估计他用不着他们俩了  -是的
- Guess he got tired of associating. - Yeah.

434
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:39,064
-介意我过去看看吗  -请便
- Do you mind if I get in there? - No, go ahead.

435
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:48,040
大块头的死亡时间要晚点
The big one smells fresher.

436
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:51,068
找到致命伤了吗
You guys find a death wound?

437
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:58,020
血倒是流了很多  但没看到弹孔
I see lots of blood,but no bullet holes.

438
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:02,029
照片都拍好了吗
You done taking pictures?

439
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:05,062
好的  把他放平了准备尸检吧
All right.Let's lay them out flat.

440
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,044

我们碰上了世上最笨的罪犯

大块头是到这搬这家伙的尸体

448

肯定是动到了上面那堆东西
When the stack must have shifted.

449
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:55,046
砸在他手臂上  把他钉在了这儿
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,

450
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:57,063
他是失血过多挂掉的
And he bled out!

451
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,019
老天有眼啊  我爱死它了
Poetic justice.Oh, I love it.

452

我不知该从何说起
I don't know where to begin.

457
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,039
你TM到这来干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

458
