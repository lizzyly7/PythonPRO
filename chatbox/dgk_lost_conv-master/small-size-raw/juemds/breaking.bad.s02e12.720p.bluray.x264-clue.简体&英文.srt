好啦好啦  啤酒可不能少啊
All right, all right. Had to get a beer.

158
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,085
好了  开始吧
All right, guys. Here we go.

159
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:40,056
有不辣  微辣和超辣的
We got mild, medium and muy caliente.

160
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,088
我要吃胸部的肉
I got dibs on the breast.

161
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,035
洛博罗炸鸡馆 
Los Pollos Hermanos?

162
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,033
是啊  你尝尝
Yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

163
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:49,077
这家店抢了肯德基不少生意
This joint gives KFC a run for their money.

164
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,067
小宝宝饿了哦
That baby's hungry.

165
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:53,064
把宝宝给我
Give me that baby.

166
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,035
来  小甜心
Aw, sweetie, here.

167
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:02,010
拜托  斯凯勒  不要再在餐桌旁吧  吃东西在呢  
Come on. Jeez, Sky. Not at the table. We're eating.

168
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,021
汉克  不就是乳房吗
Hank, it's only a breast.

169
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,053
-是我嫂子的乳房  -你真封建啊你
- It's my sister-in-law's breast. - You are so provincial.

170
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,059
你还记得那天
Remember the day

171
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,029
我们谈论关于孩子防护的问题吗
When you were talking to me about child-proofing?

172
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:16,051
你怎么看   用围栏还是棚子
What are you thinking?  A fence or a cover?

173
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:20,085
我还是觉得用警报系统比较好
Actually, I was thinking more of an alarm system.

174
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:23,075
现在有套新的系统
They've got these new systems out there,

175
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,076
声纳系统可以做到
"sonar systems" that would...

176
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,052
只要有东西进入  警报就会响起
Anything falls into it, it sets the alarm off.

177
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,005
听起来很贵吧
That sounds expensive.

178
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:34,072
嗯  也是  不过  为了宝宝
Well, yeah, but... for the baby, I mean...

179
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,018
为什么不
Why don't...

180
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,059
为什么不让我和玛丽买台送你们呢
Why don't you let Marie and I get that for you guys?

181
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,064
对啊
Absolutely.

182
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:41,064
不用  你的好意心领了
No, no, thank you

183
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,077
不用了  我马上就上班了
No, please. I'll be back at work soon.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,060
我们会想办法的
We'll take care of it.

185
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,026
马上就上班
Back at work soon?

186
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,059
因为你要做手术嘛  所以我想
Since you're scheduled for surgery, I just thought

187
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:56,003
多赚点钱是好事
It might be a good idea to have some money coming in.

188
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:02,060
斯凯勒  我们得为宝宝多考虑一下
Skyler, we need to think about what's best for the baby.

189
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,089
我觉得她妈妈应该
And I think having her mother around

190
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:06,088
前几年都呆在宝宝身边
For at least the first few years...

191
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:12,014
至于钱  我们会想办法  我保证
Money-wise, we'll manage. I promise you that.

192
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,044
怎么
What?

193
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,092
你们在车库里印钞票
You guys got a printing press in the garage churning out 50s?

194
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,037
我希望如此
I wish.

195
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,075
妈妈还说让我找个工作
Mom's even talking about me getting a job.

196
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,039
对  人人参与
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

197
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,050
为什么不吃一次中国菜
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

198
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,065
我来
I'll get her.

199
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,085
我来
I'll get her.

200
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,056
乖宝宝
Good girl.

201
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,000
真是乖宝宝
That's a good girl.

202
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,041
我的小宝贝
My little girl, huh?

203
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,077
想看看什么吗
Do you want to see something?

204
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,076
来
Come here.

205
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,078
我知道我知道
Oh. I know, I know.

206
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:34,051
你想看看爸爸给你准备了什么
You want to see what your daddy did for you?

207
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,018
我带你看看
Let me show you.

208
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,082
这儿  过来
Here. Come here.

209
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:45,012
想看吗
Want to see?

210
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,071
就是这个了
That's right.

211
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,036
爸爸挣得
Daddy did that.

212
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,070
爸爸为你挣得
Daddy did that for you.

213
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,035
这地方看起来没什么变化
This place looks exactly the same.

214
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,069
你为什么不用电脑啥的呢  
Why don't you have computers and shit?

215
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,045
现在又不是20世纪
It's the 20th century.

216
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,091
你来这搞什么鬼
What the hell are you doing here?

217
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,065
是你把东西拿跑了
You took the stash!

218
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,025
我听了所有的电话留言  终于搞明白了
I heard all those phone messages and I figured it out.

219
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,020
你搞明白了  恭喜啊  爱因斯坦
You figured it out?  Congratulations, Einstein.

220
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,046
你让我着急了一整天
You left me to freak out all day long,

221
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:43,038
像是我失职了一样  结果却是你干的好事
Like I dropped the ball!  And you were the one who took it!

222
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:45,005
闭嘴
Shut up.

223
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,086
你小点声
You lower your voice.

224
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,046
"像是"你失职了
"Like" you dropped the ball?

225
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:59,002
你什么时候没失过职  杰西
When have you ever not dropped the ball, Jesse?

226
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:02,007
你脑子里别成天尽想些那什么
Blasted out of your mind on whatever the hell that was.

227
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,044
那什么
What was that?

228
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,023
海洛因
Heroin?

229
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,036
天
Jesus.

230
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,074
我那天休息  我只在休息时吸
I was on my day off. What I do on my day off...

231
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,009
休息  我们可是随时待命  你这瘾君子
Day off?  We were on-call, you junkie.

232
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:16,038
对于这笔大买卖更是要随时待命
On-call for the biggest deal of our lives.

233
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:18,018
而且还是我拼了老命
And I just managed to pull it off by

234
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,070
侥幸才争取来的  并非你的帮助
The skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

235
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,030
你让我错过了我女儿的出生
You made me miss the birth of my daughter.

236
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,099
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

237
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,001
多少
How much?

238
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,044
什么多少
How much what?

239
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,082
这笔你赚了多少
How much did you get for the deal?

240
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,068
120万
1.2 million.

241
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,008
对半分
600,000 each.

242
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,003
你拿48万
480,000.

243
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:49,017
索尔要提百分之二十
Saul's cut is 20%.

244
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,049
那  我的钱呢
So, where's my money?

245
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:00,003
你开玩笑吧
You are joking, right?

246
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,049
要是我给了你那些钱
If I gave you that money,

247
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,044
你一星期内就得死
you would be dead inside of a week.

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,092
听着  我早就不沾海洛因了
Look, I'm off the heroin.

249
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:15,000
瞧都瞧不上眼  看着就恶心
I didn't even like it anyway. It made me sick.

250
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:17,060
还有  还有冰毒
And the... And the meth.

251
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,078
对于我来说可有可无
You know, I can take it or leave it.

252
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,007
我已经不吸了  怀特先生
I'm clean, Mr. White.

253
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,020
真的
For real.

254
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,004
证明给我看
Prove it.

255
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,006
用这个取尿样
Pee in that.

256
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:43,007
-你是幸灾乐祸吗  -快取尿样
- How gay are you?  Seriously. - Pee in it.

257
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,076
现在药店里有卖毒品检测套装
They're selling testing kits at the drug stores.

258
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:49,010
你要是真不吸了  我就给你钱
If you are clean, I will give you every last dime.

259
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:51,080
不干
No, huh?

260
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:54,084
我猜  你以后  
Well, I guess, until then,

261
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,006
得依靠
You'll just have to depend on

262
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:58,092
某个陌生人的怜悯来爽一下了
The kindness of strangers to get high.

263
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,074
包括你的小女友
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

264
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,024
别让她趴着睡  沃特
Not on her tummy, Walt.

265
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,056
我没让她趴着睡
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

266
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,075
我想让她侧着  你扶着她的背吧
I'll put her on her side. Do you want to hold her back?

267
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,052
怕她万一要吐奶
Just in case she decides to do a little spit-up,

268
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:45,066
我来卷一条毛巾垫在下面
I'll roll up a nice clean towel like this and put it under.

269
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,008
哈马克施莱默公司有这类产品
Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those.

270
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,076
是低过敏的
It's hypo-allergenic.

271
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:55,063
我想毛巾就够了
I think a towel will do.

272
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,088
怎么了
What is it?

273
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:02,048
你儿子
Your son.

274
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:05,075
真是不可思议  来看看他的杰作
He's just unbelievable. Come see what he did.

275
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:13,006
跟你说过还没弄好嘛
I told you it's not ready yet.

276
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,013
亲爱的  给他们看看吧
Honey, just show it to them.

277
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,086
天啊  儿子  太棒了
My God, son. That's wonderful.

278
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,079
做的太漂亮了
This is beautiful.

279
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:44,014
SaveWalterWhite.com  [救助沃尔特怀特.com]
SaveWalterWhite.com.

280
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,058
我呢 准备告诉所有人
Well, I, for one, am telling everybody.

281
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,021
等等
Wait a minute.

282
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:54,007
你不会是在要钱吧  儿子
You're not asking for money, are you, son?

283
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:56,005
就是这个意思啊
That's the whole idea.

284
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,039
路易斯帮忙申请了一个贝宝支付账户
Louis helped me set up a PayPal account and everything.

285
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,065
我们不能要钱啊
But we can't ask for money.

286
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,018
我很感动  真的
I appreciate it. I really do.

287
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:20,063
这主意全是他自己想的
This was all his idea.

288
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:22,054
他做的可用心了
He worked so hard on it.

289
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:24,051
就让他帮帮忙吧
Just let him help.

290
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:28,068
你不能让他放弃吧
You can't ask him to take it down.

291
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,043
那对他可是个打击
It'll crush him.

292
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:32,067
这可是施舍
It's charity.

293
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:39,064
你为什么把它说得这么不光彩
Why do you say that like it's some sort of dirty word?

294
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,006
这太荒唐了
This is insane.

295
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,035
我手头有不少现金
I have so much cash on-hand

296
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:57,078
我还得用浴室的秤来称重
That I actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

297
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,020
但是  却花不了  也不能告诉家人有这笔钱
And yet, I can't spend it. I can't tell my family about it.

298
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,008
所有人都觉得我濒临破产
All of whom think that I am right on the edge of bankruptcy.

299
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:07,079
太荒唐了
It's insane.

300
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:11,004
我猜这就是为什么强盗们都养情妇
Well, I guess that's why gangsters had molls.

301
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,060
什么
What?

302
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,038
就是女同伙
Gun molls.

303
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:16,076
你没看过《白热杀机》吗
Haven't you ever seen "White Heat"

304
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:21,034
看过  跟这有什么关系
I've seen "White Heat", but I don't see how that pertains.

305
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,085
或许你更需要一个情妇  而不是一个
Maybe you need a moll more than you need a wife

306
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:26,010
不能分享你秘密的妻子
Who you can't trust with your secrets.

307
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,008
花不出去的钱还能叫钱吗
What good is money that doesn't spend?

308
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:29,094
要是一片叶子落进丛林中
If a tree falls in the forest...

309
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,073
你应该懂了吧
You get the point.

310
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:33,065
沟通是不可行的吗
So communicating is out?

311
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,098
我想想  还有没有别的办法
Well, let's see. What else is there?

312
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:40,064
总是可以说  "我在铁路下面"
There's always, "Hey, I found a big bag of money

313
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,077
"发现一大袋钱"
"Down by the railroad tracks."

314
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:44,064
对我管用
Works for me.

315
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,040
默里叔叔
Uncle Murray.

316
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:52,049
"默里叔叔把我放在膝盖上跳啊跳
"Oh, many is the happy memory

317
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,041
是那么美好的回忆
Of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.

318
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:57,005
"我们过去都忘记了那老家伙
"We lost track of the old pervert years ago,

319
00:21:57,022 --> 00:22:00,067
"但是你知道吗  他不计前嫌  给了我一百万
"But what do you know?  He kicked it and left me millions."

320
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,051
肯定不会是纯粹的运气或者
It cannot be blind luck or some

321
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,028
假想中的亲戚帮忙
Imaginary relative who saves us.

322
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,045
是我赚来的钱
I earned that money, me.

323
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:11,066
现在我儿子建了他自己的网站
And now my son created his own website...

324
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,065
"SaveWalterWhite.com"  四处请求匿名捐赠
"SaveWalterWhite.com..." Soliciting anonymous donations.

325
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,065
你知不知道我是什么感受
Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?

326
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,063
看看  还有贝宝
Yeah, look at that. It's got PayPal and everything.

327
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,058
网络乞讨  我就是这么想的
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

328
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,063
向全世界伸手要钱
Just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world.

329
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:36,042
也没有更深层次的含义
Yeah, there's no deep-seated issues there.

330
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,026
我已经看到答案了  它正在我眼前晃悠呢
I'm looking at the answer here. It's staring me in the face.

331
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,072
-要我一字一句说出来吗  -不用  我知道
- Do I have to spell it out for you?  - No, I know.

332
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:45,022
你想让我把钱
You're thinking that I should be funneling my money

333
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:47,064
全打到我儿子的网站上去  这样绝对不行
Into my son's website, but absolutely not, no.

334
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,075
我可不想让我家人觉得
I am not going to have my family think that some

335
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,014
有一些什么神秘人在资助我们
Mystery benefactor saved us.

336
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:56,027
不是一些神秘人  就一个
Not some mystery benefactor, singular.

337
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,045
那样的话问题就多起来了  
That would raise too many questions.

338
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,035
不管怎样  跟我一起呆着
However... stay with me here...

339
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,015
僵尸  [受他人控制的远程电脑]
Zombies.

340
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,093
我朋友的朋友认识个人  
I got a guy who knows this guy

341
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,058
属于"雨人"类型
who knows this Rain Man type.

342
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:11,015
他在白俄罗斯  跟她妈妈住在地下室里
He lives with his mother in her basement in Belarus.

343
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:14,029
把他引渡回来时大有好处的
So good luck extraditing his fat Russian ass.

344
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:15,042
等等
Wait.

345
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:18,006
他可是个顶级黑客
He's a hacker-cracker extraordinaire.

346
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,098
这人可以操纵世界上任意一台个人电脑
This guy can hijack random desktops

347
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,022
把它们变成僵尸  
All around the world,

348
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,076
然后用来捐款
Turn them into zombies that do his bidding.

349
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,015
比如说
For instance,

350
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:29,051
他可以选择捐20块或者三万块
He can make it so, 20 or 30,000

351
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:32,089
从全美以及加拿大来的小笔捐款
Little donations come in from all over the U.S. and Canada.

352
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,041
10块  20块  50块积少成多
10, 20, 50 bucks a pop,

353
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:38,077
做的干净利落  不留痕迹
All paid in-full, nice and neat, untraceable,

354
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,081
来自全世界的热心人士
From the good-hearted people of the world

355
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:44,026
向沃特先生倾囊相助  帮他与癌症抗争
To Mr. Walter H. White, Cancer Saint.

356
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,079
我想着就振奋人心啊
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling just thinking about it.

357
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:56,054
他是个混蛋  就这样  总是对我指手画脚
He's an asshole, that's what. Always judging me.

358
00:23:58,052 --> 00:23:59,080
不要太多
Not too much.

359
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:02,081
我说  他算什么啊
I mean, like... like, who's he, right?

360
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:05,003
我说  起码是我带他入行的
I mean, first off, I taught him.

361
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,077
他老搞得我像是他的契约仆人一样
He's always acting like I'm his indentured servant.

362
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:20,086
用棉签
Now the cotton.

363
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:28,007
用针
Needle?

364
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:33,049
-我不明白你为什么还需要他  -对
- I don't understand why you need him. - Exactly.

365
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,039
我就这意思
My point exactly.

366
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:51,035
直直的打进去  这样针就不会乱动
Flat against your skin so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

367
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:57,083
他欠你多少
How much does he owe you, anyway?

368
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,030
妈的  要是有人欠我500块我也要气死了
Well, hell, I'd be mad, too, if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

369
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,007
不是不是
No,no...

370
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:10,003
是四十八万
480,000.

371
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,073
什么
What?

372
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,013
什么
What?

373
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,022
万
Thousand.

374
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:23,007
不要仰着睡  怕万一要吐
Not on your back, baby. In case you throw up.

375
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,040
侧着睡  侧着睡
On your side. Sleep on your side.

376
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,084
她就像在说
She's all like,

377
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:39,035
"别唠叨了"  
"Don't preach to me."

378
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:41,082
我就说  "宝贝  我没唠叨啊"
And I'm like, "Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

379
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:44,070
"我在告诉你基本的生存技能  懂吗
"I'm talking about basic survival, you know?

380
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:47,033
"我在教你认识生命与死亡
"I'm conversing about life and death."

381
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:50,056
我是说  我们所要做的就是来这儿
I mean, this here, what we've been doing...

382
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,048
见鬼  贝吉知道
Hell, Becky knows.

383
00:25:58,074 --> 00:25:59,054
老爸
Dad?

384
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,028
我睡过了  马上过来
I overslept. I'm on my way.

385
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,062
老爸
Dad?

386
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:20,084
老爸  等等
Dad, wait.

387
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,040
不是这样的
It's not what it looks like.

388
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:31,022
老爸  等等  我们谈谈行吗
Dad, just wait. Let me talk to you for one second.

389
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,093
别  别碰他  老爸
Stop it! Don't touch him, Dad!

390
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:47,041
-混蛋  -老爸  放手
- Son of a bitch. - Dad, let him go!

391
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:54,042
离我远点  走开
Get away from me, man. Back off.

392
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,017
-后退  -大家冷静一点行吗
- Back off!  - Everybody just calm down!

393
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,087
你搞什么鬼啊你
What's with you, yo?

394
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,066
小心我一棍子砸扁你
'Cause I'll seriously bust you up.

395
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,032
你个恶心的瘾君子
You miserable little smackhead.

396
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,079
-滚出去  -我可是付房租的  贱人
- Get the hell out!  - Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

397
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:06,050
我有公民权利
I got civil rights!

398
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,064
杰西  拜托  别  拜托
Jesse, come on. Please, no. Come on.

399
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,090
我自己付房租
I pay my rent.

400
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:18,004
你回戒毒所去  现在就去
You're going back to rehab. Today. Now.

401
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,065
既然已经这样了  我们就
Look, as it so happens, we were just...

402
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:23,017
好好谈谈吧
We were just talking about that and...

403
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,008
要是你给我机会的话  我是准备告诉你的  
And I was gonna tell you, okay?  If you would just let me.

404
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,040
18个月了
18 months.

405
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:29,044
你都18个月没沾毒品了  珍妮
You have been clean for 18 months, Jane.

406
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:30,099
为什么  你为什么这么做
Why? Why do you do it?

407
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,018
我又堕落了  行吗
I backslid, okay?

408
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,022
这又怎样
Like, what?

409
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:38,068
你觉得我引以为豪吗
What, you think I'm proud of this?

410
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,067
觉得我是故意要这么做吗
Like, I do it on purpose?

411
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:45,033
还跟这种败类同居鬼混
Shacking up and using with this scumbag, this loser!

412
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:47,005
你这副德性也好不到哪里去
It takes one to know one!

413
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:49,093
你不了解他
And you don't know the first thing about him.

414
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:53,003
我们每天晚上都聊戒毒的事  是他的主意
We talk about rehab every night. It's his idea.

415
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,081
你们讨论戒毒  天  真乖啊你们
You talk about rehab?  Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

416
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:00,059
感谢你没有24小时管着我
Thank you for not being judgmental 24 hours a day.

417
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:04,099
因为那就是我需要的  时刻有人关心
'Cause that's exactly what I need, to be judged all the time!

418
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,069
你知道你需要什么吗  我来告诉你
You know what you need?  I'll tell you exactly.

419
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:12,005
你干嘛
What are you doing?

420
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:14,070
-你干嘛啊  -我要报警
- What are you doing?  - I am calling the police.

421
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,046
拜托
Come on!

422
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,059
老爸  别啊
Dad, don't.

423
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,088
我花了十年时间来关爱和理解你
I have tried ten years of love and understanding.

424
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,001
但是最终的结果或许是你在监狱中度过余生
Maybe what it takes is you drying out in a jail cell.

425
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:31,018
我要报告一起吸毒事件  就在我的房子里
I would like to report drug use in a building that I own.

426
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,091
-不对  正在进行  -爸爸
- No. It's on-going. - Daddy.

427
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,060
这是非法活动  我要跟相关人员报告
It's illegal activity. I'd like to talk to somebody.

428
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,048
-你帮我转接一下  -行  行  我去戒毒中心
- Would you connect me, please?  - Fine, we'll go to rehab.

429
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:42,000
他去不去我不管
I could care less about him going to rehab.

430
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:44,066
-我要你去  -行  我明天一大早就去
- I want you in rehab. - Okay. I'll go first thing tomorrow.

431
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,004
明天不行  就今天
Not tomorrow. Today.

432
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:49,076
我要请假  退订报纸
I have to call into work. I have to stop the newspaper.

433
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:52,029
上次我去戒毒中心  家里所有的花草都死了
The last time I went to rehab, all my houseplants died

434
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,066
你又不给它们浇水
Because you didn't water them, so...

435
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,004
求您了
Please?

436
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:05,059
就明天
Tomorrow.

437
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:13,080
对不起  我搞错了 
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

438
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,091
就明天
Tomorrow.

439
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,069
你来真的
You meant all that?

440
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,015
不晓得
I don't know.

441
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,062
我只是觉得要是我们有足够的钱
I just think if we had enough money,

442
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:50,091
没人可以逼我们做任何事
nobody could make us do anything.

443
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,034
别去接了
Just let it ring.

444
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,063
我去看看是谁
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

445
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,038
没事的  霍莉
It's okay, Holly.

446
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:33,058
祝你好运  
Good luck with that.

447
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:36,026
但是我相信他会乐意写的
But I'm sure he'd be glad to, write some...

448
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,005
他现在在旁边  稍等
Actually, here he is right now. So hold on a second.

449
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,023
-怎么了  -是你的
- What?  - It's one of your...

450
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,060
你的一位学生  
One of your old students.

451
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,016
他想让你写一封推荐信
He wants a letter of recommendation.

452
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:55,030
亲爱的  我觉得宝宝好像饿了
Honey, I think the baby is getting hungry.

453
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,082
-沃特·怀特  请讲 -你好 怀特先生
-This is Walter White. -Hello,Walter White

454
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,060
抱歉  我记忆力有点差
I'm sorry. I'm having a little trouble recalling...

455
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,077
是珍妮
It's Jane.

456
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,009
杰西和珍妮
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

457
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,074
杰西的"小女友"
Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."

458
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:16,000
当然了  很久以前的事了
Of course. It really has been a long time.

459
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,055
快找个你能讲话的地方
Get somewhere you can talk.

460
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,086
好的  行
Sure. Yes.

461
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:23,019
我在想办法
I am looking into that as we speak.

462
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,063
你怎么搞到这个号码的  
How the hell did you get this number?

463
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:29,044
杰西给你的吗
Did Jesse give it to you?

464
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:32,050
杰西只要他的那一份
All Jesse wants is what's coming to him.

465
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,034
仅此而已  再无其他
No more, no less.

466
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,006
你说什么
What are you talking about?

467
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,066
四十八万块
480,000.

468
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,039
他告诉你钱的事了
He told you about the money.

469
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:45,011
他全都告诉我了
He told me everything.

470
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,003
那又怎么样
So, what is this?

471
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,069
是勒索还是什么
Some kind of blackmail or something?

472
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,058
我就是告诉你别瞧不起杰西
This is me telling you to do right by

473
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:00,035
然后把你欠他的都给他
Jesse and bring him what you owe him.

474
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:02,019
我不管这叫勒索
I don't call that blackmail.

475
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:03,076
叫作认清你自己的嘴脸
I call that you getting off your ass,

476
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,020
活的像个个人样
And being a decent human being.

477
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,012
我管这叫勒索
Well, I call it blackmail.

478
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:10,039
打我家电话  跟我老婆说话
Dialing my number. Talking to my wife.

479
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,017
你想怎样
And what's your end of this?

480
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:16,012
几十万块可以买多少海洛因
How much heroin does a half a million dollars buy?

481
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,019
我告诉你
For your information,

482
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,007
我是为杰西保管他的钱
I am holding Jesse's money for him,

483
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,096
他一分钱都不会少的
he will receive every last dollar of it.

484
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:26,069
是给他  不是你  要等到时机成熟的时候
He will... not you... at a time when I see fit.

485
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:29,013
我绝不会让他变本加厉的吸毒的
But I will not contribute to his overdose.

486
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,052
你跟他讲  要是他戒了毒
Now, you tell him, if he gets clean...

487
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,045
-是你俩都戒了毒  -告诉你
- If you both get clean... - You know what?

488
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:36,048
我收回刚刚说的  这就是勒索
I take that back. This is blackmail.

489
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:37,085
以我对你的了解
Because what I know about you...

490
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,075
高中教师堕落成毒贩
High school teacher turned drug dealer

491
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,042
妹夫的居然就还在缉毒局
With a brother-in-law in the DEA...

492
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:43,050
这可真有戏剧性啊
That'd make one hell of a story.

493
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,002
我打赌  会成为全国新闻
National news, I'll bet.

494
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,051
今晚就跟杰西两清
Do right by Jesse tonight

495
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,064
要不然我灭了你
Or I will burn you to the ground.

496
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,004
妈的
Shit.

497
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,074
他就是个高中老师  
He's a high school teacher.

498
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:06,028
他能怎么样  给你个B减
What's he gonna do? Give you a B-minus?

499
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:08,085
把你留下来洗黑板擦
Send you outside to clap the erasers?

500
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:14,085
你不会真的去警察那里吧
You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you?

501
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:17,084
不用  他会给钱的  
We won't have to. He'll pay.

502
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,070
要是他不给呢
What if he doesn't?

503
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,048
杰西  这是你该得的钱
Jesse, it's your money.

504
00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:24,062
你是清白的  他才是十恶不赦呢
You're in the right here. He's in the wrong.

505
00:33:24,074 --> 00:33:26,062
他不笨  会给钱的
He's not stupid. He'll pay.

506
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:33,011
怎么回事
What is it, really?

507
00:33:33,065 --> 00:33:36,007
你不想要这么一大笔钱了吗
You don't want your half a million dollars?

508
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,084
你打算看破红尘削发为僧吗
You wanna renounce your earthly possessions and become a monk?

509
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,027
只是  我不是那种趁火打劫的人
It's just, I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

510
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,089
再说  你也不是这样的人
And by extension, neither are you.

511
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,051
我是说  他是我搭档
I mean, he's my partner.

512
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,070
我才是你搭档
I'm your partner.

513
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:22,014
闭上眼睛  睡吧
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

514
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:38,021
要是嘲鸟不歌唱
If that mockingbird won't sing

515
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:41,098
妈妈就给你买钻石指环
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

516
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:45,099
要是钻石指环变成铜
If that diamond ring turns brass.

517
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:49,093
妈妈就给你买小镜子
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass</i>

518
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:53,097
安静安静  宝宝别哭泣
So hush, little baby Don't you cry

519
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,009
爸爸和我都爱你
Daddy loves you and so do I

520
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:17,049
她终于睡着了
She's finally asleep.

521
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:25,027
你在干什么  研究大象吗
What are you doing?  Learning about elephants?

522
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,011
亲爱的  尿布用完了  你能出去买一下吗
Honey, we're out of diapers. Would you mind going out?

523
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,016
给杰西的
Jesse.

524
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,000
不是给你的
Not you.

525
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:38,030
你翅膀硬了啊
Nice job wearing the pants.

526
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:47,091
我怎么知道她会缄口不言
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

527
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:49,069
你不必担心
I guess you don't.

528
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:56,013
你不会再收到到我们的任何消息了
You'll never hear from either of us again.

529
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:01,042
你没看到真相  杰西
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

530
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:04,003
你在犯错误
You are making a mistake.

531
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:22,030
-你知道这是什么吗  -一大堆干酪
- Do you know what this is?  - It's a whole lot of cheddar.

532
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,077
这是自由
This is freedom.

533
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:27,065
这就是说  我们可以想去哪去哪
This is saying, "I can go anywhere I want.

534
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,034
我无所不能
"I can be anybody."

535
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,089
你想成为怎样的人
What do you want to be?

536
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:35,013
你想去哪  南美  欧洲  澳洲
Where do you want to go?  South America? Europe? Australia?

537
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:37,055
新西兰是澳洲的吗  
Is New Zealand part of Australia?

538
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:39,005
新西兰就是新西兰
New Zealand is New Zealand.

539
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:40,012
对啊
Right on.

540
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,065
新西兰  就是"指环王"的拍摄地
New Zealand. That's where they made "Lord of the Rings"

541
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:46,045
我们干脆搬到那里去  你搞你的艺术创作
I say we just move there, yo. I mean, you can do your art.

542
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:49,060
行吗  你可以画当地的城堡之类的
Right?  Like, you can paint the local castles and shit

543
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:51,066
我可以做探险飞行员
And I can be a bush pilot.

544
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,041
新西兰  可以啊
New Zealand. I can get behind that.

545
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:58,043
我觉得只要我俩在一起  去哪里都好
But I guess I'm good anywhere as long as it's the two of us.

546
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,091
我们得先戒毒
But first we gotta get clean.

547
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:10,008
并不是因为有谁逼我们这么做
And not because anybody's telling us to.

548
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,096
是为咱俩好  懂吗
We do this for us, right?

549
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:14,040
当然了
Absolutely.

550
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:16,026
-为咱俩  -所有这些
- For us. - All this here...

551
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:18,049
我们再也不往胳膊里打这些东西了
We're not gonna just shoot this up our arms.

552
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,074
绝不
We're not.

553
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:20,089
不
Hell, no.

554
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,064
我们是好人
We're better than that.

555
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:25,011
我们是大好人了  现在
We're way better than that. I say...

556
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:29,011
我们把剩下的冲走  然后今晚就出发
I say we flush what we've got left and we start tonight.

557
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,003
可以
We can do that.

558
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,033
当然了
Definitely.

559
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,017
抱歉
Excuse me.

560
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,081
需要什么吗
What can I get you?

561
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,068
给我一杯比利时黑啤[新比利时酒厂著名产品]
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

562
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,030
该死
Damn it.

563
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,088
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

564
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,060
真不知道该怎么跟你说
No. I don't know what to tell you.

565
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:14,094
我去了三家商店
Three stores I've been to so far,

566
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:16,094
每家都没货
And not one of them have it in stock.

567
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:21,013
尿布又不是必备商品
Do they have to be diapers for newborns?

568
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:24,009
我们看能否加大个尺码  只是
What if we went up a size and just kind of...

569
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:26,089
行  行  我懂了
All right. No, I understand.

570
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:30,002
行  我再去找找
All right. I'll just... I'll just keep looking.

571
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:33,019
我正在往沃尔玛去
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

572
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:43,032
演得真好
Well played.

573
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:56,020
他们在火星上发现了水
They found water on Mars.

574
00:39:58,024 --> 00:39:59,042
确实是这样
They have indeed.

575
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,087
但是却不知道如何利用这个信息
Don't exactly know what to do with that information,

576
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,002
但是上帝保佑  他们发现了
but God bless them, they found it.

577
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,068
实际上  他们
Actually, they

578
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:13,052
理论上可以从氧气中分离出氢气
Theoretically can separate the hydrogen from the oxygen

579
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:17,055
然后用于飞船的燃料
And process that into providing fuel for man's space flights.

580
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,065
从表面上将火星变成加油站
Ostensibly turning Mars into a giant gas station.

581
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,083
那么
So, it's a...

582
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:28,046
我们生活在一个新奇的时代
We live in an amazing time.

583
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:31,039
为火星上的水干杯
To water on Mars.

584
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,001
为火星上的水干杯
To water on Mars.

585
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,066
你的孩子怎么样
So, what'd you have?

586
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,089
女孩还是男孩
Girl or boy?

587
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:42,081
是个女孩
A little girl.

588
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:44,032
不错啊
That's nice.

589
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:46,003
恭喜了
Congratulations.

590
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:48,005
我有个女儿
I have a daughter.

591
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,030
多大了
How old?

592
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,099
长很大了
Old enough to know better.

593
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,055
下个月就27岁
27 next month.

594
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:59,022
有其他孩子吗
You have other kids?

595
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,018
只有这一个
Just the one.

596
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,084
我还有个16岁的儿子
I've got a 16-year-old boy.

597
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,082
快16岁了
Well, he's almost 16.

598
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:10,057
现在孩子长得快啊
There's a spread.

599
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:14,044
他挺能帮忙的  
But he helps out, though.

600
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:16,081
现在他都可以帮忙换尿布了
He's even changing some diapers now, so...

601
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:20,032
比我那时要能干多了
It's more than I managed to do when I was his age.

602
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:23,079
孩子们如今成长起来可快了  我觉得
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

603
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:26,084
可能是吧
Maybe so.

604
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,070
那么有没有什么建议呢
So, any advice?

605
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,029
养女儿这方面的
Having a daughter.

606
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:34,059
有什么建议
Any advice?

607
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,009
没什么特别的
Not really.

608
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,062
就要爱他们
Just love them.

609
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,022
我是说  他们
I mean, they...

610
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:44,016
他们拥有属于自己的权利
They are who they are.

611
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:52,000
我有个  外甥

这个外甥  我是说  他是成年人了
This nephew who is... I mean, he's an adult.

613
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:03,035
但是你还是不能放任他们
But you can't infantilize them,

614
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:04,081
你也不能掌控他们的生活
you can't live their life for them.

615
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:10,065
但仍会有不愉快的事
But still, I mean, there is that frustration.

616
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:14,091
天  从小到大总有这种不愉快的事
God, that frustration that goes along with,

617
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:17,043
"是的  事实就是  我很了解
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know

618
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:19,073
你该做什么  所以你听好"
What is best for you, so listen."

619
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:23,078
但是当然了  他们可不这么想
But of course, they don't.

620
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,065
你遇到这种情况怎么处理呢
What do you do with someone like that?

621
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:30,037
家人
Family.

622

家人

623
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,016
你绝对不能抛弃你的家人  绝对不能

624
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,052
除此之外  你就身无他物了
I mean, what else is there?

625
00:43:31,038 --> 00:43:32,038
是我
It's me!

626
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:41,035
我只是想谈谈
