怎么了
What's up?

00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,023
要买什么吗
What you need?

9
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,090
是买货还是停下来看我好看啊
Yo, you buying, or are you just stopping to envy?

10
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,034
这帮傻逼

Bounce, little man.

14
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,072
瘦子  我现在在第二大道和黑兹尔坦路交叉口
Yo,Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,

15
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,005
被人盯上了
Getting eyeballed hard.

16
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,062
有点不对劲  兄弟  快来帮我
I got a bad feeling, man.I need some backup.

17
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,025
尽快赶来
Get your ass up here now.

18
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:25,069
你耳朵上那是啥  
What's that thing in your ear?

19
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,062
我怎么跟你说的  闪开
What did I say? Get out of here!

20
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,056
还在瞎磨蹭什么  快走
What are you waiting for? Go!

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,020
绝

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,020
命

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,020

第十一集

27
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,046
治疗已经初见成效
We've made such headway with your treatments

28
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:43,074
是时候讨论下接下来的治疗计划了
That now it's time we talked about sealing the deal.

29
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,002
当然
Absolutely.

30
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,057
你们知道的
As you know,

31
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:50,045
最初的诊断是说你的癌症不适于手术
My initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable.

32
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,099
现在情况不一样了
That may no longer be the case.

33
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:58,081
我们认为目前来说肺叶切除手术是可取之选
We think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option.

34
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,022
也许还是个非常不错的选择
Maybe a pretty good option.

35
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,091
布冯尼克医生是国内为数不多的
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country

36
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:06,057
能实施全剂量放疗后肺叶切除术的医生之一
Performing lobectomies after full-dosage radiation.

37
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,076
且手术成功率很高
He's got a good track record.

38
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,025
成功率颇高
Pretty good.

39
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,075
听上去
It sounds...

40
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,016
很不错
Aggressive.

41
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,042
对  正是这样
Yes. Very much so.

42
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,046
你们要知道  如果不动这个手术
Understand that if you don't have this surgery,

43
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:24,001
就只能眼睁睁等着癌细胞扩散
You're just waiting for the cancer to spread.

44
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,077
这是一定的
And it will.

45
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,072
现在  通过之前的治疗  
Now,through the treatment you've had already,

46
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:30,024
我们给你争取了点时间
We've bought you some time...

47
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:32,097
也许很久  也可能很短
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

48
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,032
但也就如此而已
But that's all.

49
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,037
在我看来
In my opinion,

50
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:40,026
如果你愿意冒险一试
If you're willing to take some risk,

51
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:43,007
那这就是最好的机会了
Then this offers the best chance.

52
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,071
治疗费用要多少
How much would it cost?

53
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,049
我没有医疗保险
I'm not on your insurance.

54
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:56,045
我算下来  总共费用
I'd say between 170,000

55
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,085
大概17万到20万
And 200,000, all in.

56
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,049
我这部分的费用  我当然愿意帮你尽量减免
For my part, I'd be willing to write off what I can,

57
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,073
但最花钱的并不是我这部分
But mine isn't even the biggest expense.

58
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:11,004
当然  这是个重大决定
This is obviously a big decision.

59
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,032
两位应该会想好好商量一下
And you folks are gonna want to take some time to discuss it.

60
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,012
不用了
No.

61
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,008
我接受手术
I'll do it.

62
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:29,048
沃尔特 你不觉得我们至少该先商量商量吗
Walt, don't you think we should at least talk this through first?

63
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,097
我只是觉得这是个办法
I just think it's the way to go.

64
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,079
我不得不说  你做出了正确的选择
I have to say I think It's the right choice.

65
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,039
我建议我们再等上两周  让肺炎痊愈
I recommend we let the pneumonitis heal for couple of weeks,

66
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,070
然后就进行手术
And then we'll have at it.

67
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:53,044
这恐怕不行  我...
That's tricky.I...

68
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,038
-预产期什么时候  -21号
- When's the due date? - It's the 21st.

69
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,068
还有两周就生了
So two weeks and change?

70
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,002
我把手术排在四周之后
I'll book the surgery for four weeks from now.

71
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:04,005
那样的话  
That way,

72
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,016
沃尔特能亲自迎接女儿的降生
Walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter.

73
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,061
但不能再拖下去了
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

74
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,084
14条短信...
14 messag...

75
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,064
天哪
God.

76
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,033
喂
Yeah

77
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,023
是我
It's me.

78
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:42,041
你TM去哪了  我打了不下20个电话找你
Where the hell were you?I called, like, 20 times.

79
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,097
在忙
Working.

80
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,060
什么事
What is it?

81
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:50,026
康宝死了
Combo's dead.

82
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,014
枪杀的
Shot.

83
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,061
他是哪个
Which one is he?

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,086
你不会就来这么一句吧
You did not just say that to me.

85
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:01,023
-杰西  听着  -我就知道会这样
- Jesse, listen... - That figures.

86
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:15,040
外面的人都怎么说
What's the word on the street?

87
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:18,017
没人看到  不知道谁干的
No one's dropping no names.

88
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,043
康宝出事前给我打过电话  
Combo rang me before it went down.

89
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,093
说被人盯上了
Said dudes were mad-dogging him,

90
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:25,012
把他逼到了街角  我就知道这些
Trying to run him up off the corner.That's all I know.

91
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,033
我们为啥得急着扩展地盘  我是说
Why'd we have to go pushing into new turf, yo? I mean,

92
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,070
你到底想做什么
What'd you expect?

93
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,055
我不知道
I don't know.

94
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,018
你不知道
You don't know?

95
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:40,022
你就会说这么一句吗
Is that all you got?

96
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:44,007
我会安置好康宝的家人
I'll do right by Combo's people.

97
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,018
你得记着把你手机砸了扔了
Make sure you bust up your cell and toss it.

98
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:51,023
我们会找到凶手的
We'll figure it out.

99
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,047
我很感激你能这么说
I appreciate what you're saying and all,

100
00:07:55,047 --> 00:08:00,005
但康宝死了  猴子又去了卡利避风头
But with Combo gone and Badger laying low out in Cali...

101
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:03,046
我还在缓刑期呢  伙计
I'm on probation, man.

102
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,056
随时都可能被抓进去
Fast track to Los Lunas.

103
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,036
我们眼看着
We're on the verge

104
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:13,086
就能赚到大笔大笔的银子  瘦子
Of making some serious coin.Skinny.

105
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,026
怎么  你现在想收手不干吗
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

106
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,043
俗话说  
This game we playing,

107
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,082
没有金刚钻别揽瓷器活
We don't got the street cred to survive it.

108
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,032
要是放在以前  大家都以为是你杀了精虫
Back when everyone thought you killed Spooge,

109
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,068
也许我们还有戏
Maybe we were doing okay,

110
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,062
但那件事...
But that whole...

111
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,055
用自动取款机砸人脑袋那事
Thing to the head thing, the ATM?

112
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,056
他那吸毒的婊子都招了
His junkie bitch copped to it.

113
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:37,033
全城的人都知道不是你干的了
The whole town knows it wasn't you.

114
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,078
大家都知道了
Everyone knows?

115
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,090
你为什么不早说  
Why didn't you say something?

116
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,014
我不知道
I don't know, man.

117
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,067
因为我们都喜欢你吧
'Cause we like you and all.

118
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,028
我跟你说  你等着瞧好了
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

119
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,088
我们会没事的
We'll get by.

120
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,017
我们能成的
We'll make it.

121
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,072
杰西  抱歉
Sorry, Jesse.

122
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,093
我不干了
I'm out.

123
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:16,056
我们遇到了点小挫折
We have had a bit of a setback.

124
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,044
抱歉  事实就是如此
Sorry, that's an accurate description.

125
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,065
你还想让我怎么说
What else do you want me to call it?

126
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,037
认个错怎么样  说你做错了  
How about your fault? How about that?

127
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,077
别赖我头上
Don't lay that on me.

128
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,052
负责销售的人是你  
You are in charge of distribution.

129
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,000
是你说要扩张地盘的
You said expand the territory.

130
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,047
-那我也没让你们这么不小心啊  -两位  两位
- That doesn't mean you become careless.- Guys, guys!

131
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,011
你们以为这是上脱口秀呢
Who do I look like, Maury Povich?

132
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,085
我也不是你们的婚姻顾问
I'm not your marriage counselor.

133
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:36,063
你们都是行家  拿点样子出来
Now, you're professionals.Act like it.

134
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,065
遇到点小挫折  继续
Now, setback. Go.

135
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:42,013
我们有个毒贩被杀了
One of our dealers was murdered.

136
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:47,058
就像地盘争夺战一样
It was some kind of turf dispute,

137
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,007
很显然  我们输了
And apparently we lost.

138
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,085
然后我们的人都不干了
And then everyone quit on us.

139
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:55,043
我们的货完全动不了
We have absolutely no distribution.

140
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,034
那这些事有没有可能追查到你们头上
Is there any way any of this can be traced back to you?

141
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,034
我说的是警察
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

142
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,011
这真是不幸中的万幸
There's your silver lining.

143
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:09,008
你呢  健康状况如何
How about you?How's the health situation?

144
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,086
好点了  别抽了行不
It's better.Do you mind?

145
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,088
好点了
Better?

146
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,078
治疗看起来效果不错
It's looking a little more positive.

147
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,010
我剩下的时间比我预想的多
I may have more time than I thought.

148
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,032
非常好
Outstanding.

149
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,000
说起那个死掉的
Now, as to your dead guy,

150
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:32,023
干这行难免的
Occupational hazard.

151
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,026
毒贩挨枪子
Drug dealer getting shot,

152
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,075
我就直说吧  
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

153
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:38,023
这是明摆着的
And say it's been known to happen.

154
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,041
你们手头的货呢  还有多少存货
Now, what about product on hand?How's your inventory?

155
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,082
38多点
38 and change.

156
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,088
38盎司[1KG多点]  还是38克
38 ounces? Grams?

157
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,029
38磅[17KG多]
Pounds.

158
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,000
你说过让我们别坐失良机
You did say make hay while the sun is shining.

159
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,058
两位
Guys!

160
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,011
干嘛还拉长个脸
Why the long faces here?

161
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,050
你们简直坐拥金山啊
You're sitting on a gold mine.

162
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,077
坐拥金山却卖不出去
A gold mine we can't sell.

163
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,070
我们需要严密的组织结构
We need a proper infrastructure.

164
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,002
需要在街头有靠得住的
We need foot soldiers and dealers

165
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,028
毒贩销售网络
On a street level that are rock solid.

166
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:14,015
我们需要实力  需要精兵强将
We need muscle,and we need enforcers.

167
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,031
我们需要的是投资回报率
Payback.That's what we need.

168
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,046
老天
God.

169
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:27,067
我是说  这整个过程简直就是
I mean, this entire process has just been so...

170
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:35,020
总是这么进一步退两步
It's always been one step forward and two steps back.

171
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:37,042
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

172
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:42,032
那我就只能爱之深责之切了  好吗
Let's start with some tough love, all right?

173
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,025
做好心理准备了吗  听听这个
Ready for this?Here goes.

174
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,081
你们俩对兜售毒品实在一窍不通
You two suck at peddling meth.

175
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:47,089
就是这样
Period.

176
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,013
所以  别想着自己干这个了
So give up on trying to do it all yourselves.

177
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,051
见鬼  我都奇怪你们竟能走到这一步
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

178
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,021
我们不想再跟个
Look, we are not going to deal with

179
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,045
高级经销商打交道了
Another high-level distributor.

180
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,071
谢谢了  那条路我们试过了  此路不通
No, thank you.We have been down that road.

181
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,073
什么  你是说那些纹满纹身的瘾君子
What?Some tattooed speed-freak?

182
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:06,099
你们需要的是个如假包换的商人
Now,what you two need is an honest-to-God businessman.

183
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,096
一个把你们的货
Somebody who treats your product

184
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,061
当高利润日用品一样卖的人
Like the simple high-margin commodity that it is.

185
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:16,006
一个能做出口  还只做批发的人
Somebody who ships out of town,deals only in bulk.

186
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,015
一个干这行20年
Someone who's been doing this for 20 years

187
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:21,012
从未失手的人
And never been caught.

188
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:24,056
你认识这样的人
You know someone like that?

189
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,081
我只能说  我能通过认识的人
Let's just say I know a guy

190
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,024
他再通过认识的人
who knows a guy.

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,060
最后才能找上他
Who knows another guy.

192
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,040
容我打几个电话  看看能不能安排你们见见
Let me make some calls,see if I can get you a meeting.

193
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,040
那他叫什么名字
Well, what's his name?

194
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:41,036
无可奉告
I have no idea.

195
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,020
他行事非常低调
He's very low profile.

196
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,097
就是这么小心谨慎
He's careful like that.

197
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,047
据我所知
From what I do hear about him,

198
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,062
他行事跟你很像
He sounds a little like you.

199
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,028
你得离开这儿
I need you to leave.

200
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,089
听着  有些事
Look, there's...

201
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,036
我有些事瞒着你
Some stuff about me you don't know, and...

202
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:32,021
譬如说你是个贩毒的
Like you're a drug dealer?

203
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,053
我大概猜到了点
I kind of got that.

204
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,086
你用现金付账  还用个化名  所以
You pay in cash,and you use an alias, so...

205
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,075
我的一个手下
One of my guys,

206
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,059
帮我做事的一个朋友
A friend who worked for me...

207
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:55,061
被杀了
Got murdered.

208
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,078
是我的错  是我让他去那一带的
It was my fault.I put him on that corner.

209
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,016
我先去吸几口
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

210
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:07,059
我就是觉得你该离开这儿  毕竟你
And I just think you should go, being that you're

211
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,079
已经在戒毒了
In a program and all and...

212
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:15,023
你可以跟我一块去参加戒毒会
You could come with me to a meeting.

213
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,074
不
No

214
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,099
不去戒毒会
No meetings.

215
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,010
或者就这么出去走走也好
We could just get out of here.

216
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:31,061
-吸毒对你没好处  -不  有用的
- It won't help. - Yeah, it will.

217
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:35,041
我不需要你来告诉我这些
And I don't need you telling me that it won't.

218
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,041
我只想
I just...

219
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,085
好吧  我只想让你离开这儿
All right, I really just need you to go.

220
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,040
先生
Sir?

221
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,077
祝您用餐愉快
Enjoy your meal.

222
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,096
谢谢
Thank you

223
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,070
你迟到了
You're late.

224
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,075
是啊  这是历史性的时刻
Yeah,We're in the big time now.

225
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,045
那么  我们的主角呢
So where's the kingpin?

226
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,062
我也不知道
Your guess is as good as mine.

227
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,091
那你知道他名字了吗
So you get the dude's name?

228
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:44,098
不知道
No.

229
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:46,089
这么说是这样的  
So let me get this straight.

230
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,002
他知道我们的名字
He's allowed to know all our names,

231
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,048
知道我们的长相  却没有出现
What we look like,but not the other way around?

232
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,069
你干嘛不去叫点吃的
Why don't you get yourself some food?

233
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,024
这样就不用呆瓜似的  
So we won't both sit here with our Happy Meals,

234
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:02,023
对着开心乐园餐傻坐了吗
Looking like a couple chumps?

235
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:05,003
两位  一切都还满意吧
Gentlemen,is everything to your satisfaction?

236
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,071
很好  谢谢
Fine, thanks.

237
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:11,035
除了那个同性恋就没人来过
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

238
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,026
我不明白  老兄
I don't get you, man.

239
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:18,012
一周前  你说得好像胸有成竹的样子
A week ago you talked like you were all ready to hang it up.

240
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:22,080
我们还有差不多40磅的货得卖出去
We've nearly got 40 pounds we still need to sell.

241
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,083
然后呢
What about after?

242
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,022
然后  你还想变什么戏法吗
After, you gonna make up some new magic number?

243
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:31,026
像什么  "我要钱我要钱我要钱钱钱"
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.I gotta make more."

244
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,059
杰西  你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

245
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,027
-形势有变  -我想起来了
- Things have changed. - Oh, I know.

246
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,064
我们的人被杀了
We got a guy killed.

247
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,070
你知道吗
You know what?

248
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,083
这都是扯淡
This is bullshit.

249
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,014
我先走一步
I'm out of here.

250
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,008
我想她这是小睡初醒呢
I think she's waking up from a nap.

251
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,061
她肯定急着想出来  
She is certainly going to want to get out

252
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,051
好好舒展下手脚了
And stretch those legs soon.

253
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,002
我们得留心着点你的羊水
We'll keep an eye on your fluids.

254
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,086
比正常水平偏低
You're on the low side of normal.

255
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,083
什么  低多少
What? How low?

256
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:21,003
只要没有急剧下降  就不会有问题  
It's not a problem unless we see a growth drop-off,

257
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,010
放心吧
So we're good.

258
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,069
只要下周来做个超声检查  
We'll just have you in for an ultrasound next week

259
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,010
最近行动小心点
And keep an eye on things.

260
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:30,091
老天  你都不知道这一路有多堵
Oh, man, you would not believe the traffic.

261
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,022
所以我提前40分钟出发了
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

262
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:34,015
抱歉
Sorry.

263
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,079
-我错过什么了吗  -给你贴冰箱上
- What did I miss? - For your refrigerator.

264
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,091
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

265
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,047
看看她
Look at her.

266
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,059
快看
Look.

267
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:46,005
老天  面目栩栩如生呢
God. It's like she's here already.

268
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:49,031
我刚在跟斯凯勒说  一切都好
I was just telling Skyler everything looks great.

269
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:52,028
好了  我们商量了几个月了
Okay, we've been talking about it for months now.

270
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,023
该做决定了
It's time to make a decision.

271
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:57,049
-知道我说的是什么吗  -剖腹产的事吗
- You know what I'm going to say? - The C-section?

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,028
如果你们同意的话  我们就排个日程
And if it's a yes,we need to schedule it.

273
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:05,024
上次分娩的经历太痛苦了  所以
My last labor was pretty tough, so...

274
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:09,048
为了宝宝  我同意了
For the baby, I say yes.

275
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,027
考虑到你的羊水偏少  我也赞成
I agree, considering that your fluids are on the low side.

276
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,023
最好的话  还是早点动手术
It's best we take her a little early.

277
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,055
这样的话  我们何不排在
So why don't we schedule it for...

278
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,046
下周五怎么样
A week from Friday?

279
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,016
那天不是黑色星期五吧
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

280
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,027
孩子生日都定好了
We have a birthday.

281
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,027
16号
The 16th.

282
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:33,007
好日子
I like it.

283
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,046
你知道  说起生日
You know, speaking of birthdays,

284
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,009
我还得回公司一趟  那我们晚点见咯
I've got to run back to the office,so I will see you later?

285
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,058
还有一个小时就下班了
It's an hour before closing.

286
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,058
你不该这么赶来赶去的
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

287
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:49,010
我们要为泰德的生日小聚一番
We're having a little get-together for Ted's birthday

288
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,034
我还得去取蛋糕
And I've got to pick up the cake.

289
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,039
为什么让你去取
Why you?

290
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:56,051
因为我说了我去取
Because I said I would.

291
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,060
至少我能做这事吧
It's the least I can do.

292
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:05,032
-再见  -再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

293
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,027
我们出去逛逛吧
Let's get out of here.

294
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,050
做点什么
You know, go do something.

295
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:00,044
说真的
Seriously.

296
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,065
记得你说起过的圣达菲博物馆吗
You know that museum in Santa Fe you talked about?

297
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,091
我们去参观下
Let's take a drive.

298
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,047
没问题
Sure.

299
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:34,057
我不能退还那批原料  都已经钻孔切割了
No I can't return the stock.It's already been drilled and cut

300
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,069
工序都完成一半了
We're halfway through the job.

301
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,029
贝内克先生请到车间来
Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.

302
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,061
行了  让我考虑一下  好吗
All right.Just let me think about it, okay?

303
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,078
我得挂了
I gotta go.

304
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,013
迪安  我得挂电话了
Dean, I gotta go.

305
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:56,028
生日快乐
Happy Birthday!

306
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,093
生日快乐
Happy Birthday!

307
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:02,087
天哪  太漂亮了  谢谢大家
My God. This is beautiful, guys.Thank you very much.

308
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:05,084
快点  这些蜡烛撑不了多久
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna hold out much longer.

309
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,096
等一下
Wait a minute.

310
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,014
你不许愿吗  你得先许愿
Are you making a wish?You gotta make a wish.

311
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:13,092
好吧让我想想  经济一蹶不振
Ok, well, let's see.The economy's in the toilet.

312
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:17,014
中国又处处削价竞争  我不知道说啥好了
China's undercutting us at every turn...I'm at a loss.

313
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,041
等等
Wait.

314
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,048
斯凯勒
Skyler

315
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,077
我想先听你唱歌
I want to hear it first.

316
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:26,039
绝对不行  没门
Absolutely not.No way.

317
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:29,000
你可不能拒绝老板的生日愿望
You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.

318
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,065
-是的我可以  看我这样子  -求你了
- Yes, I can. Watch me. - Please!

319
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:35,094
如果这就是你的生日愿望  我只能说抱歉了
If this is your birthday wish,I feel very, very sorry for you.

320
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:39,033
-来吧  上次你唱得多好  -那都是陈年往事了
- Come on. It was so good last time. - It was ages ago.

321
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:42,045
我现在挺着个大肚子
And I'm enormous now.

322
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:44,083
跟以前判若两人了
And I don't look anything like her anymore.

323
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:47,034
就是以前也不行啊  拜托
Not that I ever did.I mean, come on.

324
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:49,096
各位  蜡烛都快燃尽  蜡烛油滴得到处都是了
You guys, these candles are getting wax all over the place.

325
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,050
-答应他吧  -来吧  斯凯勒
- Seriously. - Yes, come on, Skyler.

326
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,059
斯凯勒
Skyler

327
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,079
太难为情了
It's obscene.

328
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:15,070
祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday to you

329
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:22,018
祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday to you

330
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,084
祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday

331
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,036
贝内克制造公司的老总
Mr. President Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated

332
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:42,074
祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday to you

333
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:49,067
唱得太好了
That was fantastic.

334
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,066
唱得很棒  对吧
Isn't she great, huh?

335
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,095
好了  吹蜡烛了
Okay, here we go.

336
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,092
-他根本没出现  -他已经在那了
- He wasn't there.- He was there all right.

337
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,059
你在说什么  
What are you talking about?

338
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,025
我坐那等了两个小时  没人来过
I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.

339
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:15,091
我只知道我的线人说他就在那
All I know is my contact says he was there.

340
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:18,050
你确定你没走错餐厅吗
Are you sure you were at the right restaurant?

341
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,035
是的  我非常确定
Yes, I'm positive.

342
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:22,022
-他到底在哪  -谁知道
- Where was he? - Who knows?

343
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:23,099
也许他一直呆在外面停车场里
Maybe he stayed out in the parking lot,

344
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:25,062
透过长焦镜头观察着你
Checked you out with a telephoto lens.

345
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,013
又不喜欢你样子
Didn't like the cut of your jib.

346
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:28,024
话说回来
Anyway,

347
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:32,018
也无所谓了  我的线人说交易的事黄了
It doesn't matter now because my contact says it's a no go.

348
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,059
什么  你什么意思
What?What do you mean?

349
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,024
黄了  没成
No deal. No dice.

350
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:38,000
错失良机  不干了
Shot at and missed, shit on and hit.

351
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,068
等一下  
Wait a minute.

352
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,043
他怎么能见都不见我们就决定了
How can he make that decision without even meeting me?

353
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:45,070
我跟你说过  他对选择交易对象非常谨慎
I told you he's very cautious who he does business with.

354
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,033
好吗  他就像鹿一样小心翼翼
All right?He's skittish, like a deer.

355
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:53,034
把他叫回来
Call him back.

356
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,064
抱歉  我不能这么做
I'm sorry.I can't do that.

357
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,035
你可以的  索尔  打电话给他
Yes, you can.Call him, Saul.

358
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:01,054
首先  我从没给他打过电话  好吗
First of all,I never called him, all right?

359
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:03,061
我都是经过好几层才联络上他的
I called a guy who called a guy who called a guy.

360
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:05,056
其次  这事没戏了
Second of all, it's over.

361
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:08,013
明白吗  对每个人来说
Understand? With this particular individual,

362
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:10,043
机会只有一次
All you get is the one shot.

363
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:16,010
听着  我会想想其他办法
Look,I'll see if I can scrape something else together,

364
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,019
但别抱太大希望
But don't get your hopes up.

365
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,028
没人能像他那样拿下这么大一票货
No one else handles that kind of bulk.

366
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,070
妈的
Damn it.

367
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,057
露西  记得
Lucy, you must remember to

368
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,032
盐瓶 胡椒瓶一定要擦
Have the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

369
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,022
需要什么吗  先生
Can I help you, sir?

370
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:18,062
健怡可乐  谢谢
Diet Coke, please.

371
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:24,002
再借用你5分钟时间
And five minutes of your time.

372
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:36,054
需要效劳吗
What can I do for you?

373
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,056
坐吧
Have a seat.

374
00:27:39,052 --> 00:27:40,037
请坐
Please.

375
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:56,002
我想知道你昨天为什么不见我
I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

376
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,043
抱歉  我听不懂
I'm sorry.I'm not following.

377
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:04,076
我昨天就坐在这儿  等着见一个人
I sat here yesterday,waiting to meet with someone.

378
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,009
我相信那个人就是你
I believe that person was you.

379
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:12,033
我想你认错人了
I think that you're confusing me for someone else.

380
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:15,081
我不这么认为
I don't think I am.

381
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,058
先生  如果您有任何不满
Sir, if you have a complaint,

382
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:23,092
建议您通过电子邮件提交
I suggest you submit it through our e-mail system.

383
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,056
我很乐意帮您上传到我们的网站
I would be happy to refer you to our website.

384
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:31,016
有人告诉我  我要见的这个人
I was told that the man I would be meeting with

385
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,058
行事非常小心
Is very careful.

386
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:34,094
是个谨慎的人
A cautious man.

387
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,002
我相信这点上我们很像
I believe we're alike in that way.

388
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:44,057
如果我猜得没错
If you are who I think you are,

389
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,055
你就该再给我一次机会
You should give me another chance.

390
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,048
我不认为我们有什么像的  怀特先生
I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White.

391
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,073
你根本就不是个谨慎的人
You are not a cautious man at all.

392
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,024
你的搭档迟到了  他还吸毒
Your partner was late, and he was high.

393
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,060
是的
Yes, he was.

394
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,076
他毒瘾很重  是吗
He's high often, isn't he?

395
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:16,067
你判断力太差
You have poor judgment.

396
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,030
我不能跟判断力这么差的人共事
I can't work with someone with poor judgment.

397
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:23,044
你对我生产的货了解吗
Are you familiar with my product?

398
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,054
据说非常赞
I've been told it's excellent.

399
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:28,016
那是毋庸置疑的
It is impeccable.

400
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:30,038
绝对是最纯的
It is the purest,

401
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:33,091
放到市面上绝对供不应求
Most chemically-sound product on the market anywhere.

402
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:36,048
我可以找其他人要货
That is not the only factor.

403
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,089
以我目前的定价
You could charge twice

404
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,052
你还可以翻一番卖  
The current rate for what I provide,

405
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:43,002
他们照样会买
And your customers would pay it.

406
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,095
易如反掌
Hands down.

407
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:50,013
我选谁跟我一起做买卖
Now, who I choose to do business with on my end

408
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:52,006
那不关你的事
Is not your problem.

409
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,012
你不用见他
You won't see him.

410
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,021
不用跟他联系
You won't interact with him.

411
00:29:58,051 --> 00:29:59,098
就当他不存在
Forget he exists.

412
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,010
我不得不问一句
I have to ask.

413
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,048
为什么
Why?

414
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,047
因为他对我言听计从
Because he does what I say.

415
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:17,085
因为我能信任他
Because I can trust him.

416
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:21,074
你们手头有多少货
How much product do you have on hand?

417
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,090
38磅
38 pounds.

418
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,094
准备一次出清
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

419
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,010
我怎么听你的答复
Will I hear from you?

420
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,028
我有你的号码
I have your numbers.

421
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,067
永远不要信任吸毒的人
You can never trust a drug addict.

422
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:05,087
看  都是各种名目的零星支出
Look, I mean, it's all kind of little dribs and drabs,

423
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,010
但是这里  以凯勒公司为例
But right here,take Keller, for instance.

424
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:12,038
这边几百  那边几千的
A couple hundred dollars here,a few thousand there.

425
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:14,022
都是零星支出
Dribs and drabs.

426
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,085
一旦加起来  单单凯勒公司一项
Once you add it all up, though,and with Keller,

427
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:20,037
就比应缴税额少交了将近10%
The revenues are almost 10% less than was actually received.

428
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:24,068
过去两年每个季度都是这样
And this is every quarter,for the last two years.

429
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,000
我看到之后  觉得很担心
When I saw that, I got worried

430
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,050
所以我查了下其他客户的应收账款
So I checked Accounts Receivable on other customers.

431
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:38,089
发现还有其他六家的账款短报了
I found six other instances of revenues being under-reported.

432
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,095
而这只是刚刚开始查
And I've only just started to look into it.

433
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:46,051
我们跟很多这样的公司订立了需求合约
We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies.

434
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:48,096
他们会预估下一季的需求给我们
They anticipate their needs for the next quarter.

435
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,013
多数时候  他们会高估一点
Most of the time, they overestimate.

436
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,078
所以我就把高估的部分  滚动计入下张订单
So I just let them roll their overages into the next order

437
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,006
不然的话  客户就会流失
And if I don't,they'll go elsewhere.

438
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,074
很明显  我们疏忽了
Obviously, we forgot

439
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,035
没回溯过去调整收入记录
And didn't go back and adjust the revenue entries.

440
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:05,053
我知道站在会计的角度  
I know it's wrong from an accounting standpoint,

441
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,021
这是不对的
But as you can see,

442
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:09,021
但你可以看到  最终钱还是进账了
The money's coming in ventually.As you can see.

443
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,008
对
Right.

444
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,025
是的  但是
Right, but...

445
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:17,037
我在储藏室拿了以前的销售单据和订购单
I got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage,

446
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:20,013
想分一下类
To try and sort this out.

447
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:23,008
多数时候
And most of the time,

448
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,000
根本就没有收入记录的备份
There's no backup for the reported revenues at all.

449
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:29,011
有些文件中
In a few cases,

450
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,097
我发现了数据涂改过的影印件
I found Xeroxed copies with the dates changed.

451
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,010
泰德
Ted

452
00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:50,025
好吧
All right.

453
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,075
被你逮到了
You got me.

454
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:58,073
这可是将近一百万美金的未申报收入
We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue.

455
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,057
-你到底在想些什么  -我想的是
- What are you thinking? - I'm thinking

456
