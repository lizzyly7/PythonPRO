1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,059
最后  我要说的是我们会严肃处理此事
In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously.

2
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,030
无论是本地警方还是药品管理局
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:12,024
阻止冰毒的生产和销售
Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:14,017
仍是当务之急
Remains one of our highest priorities.

5
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:16,028
贵校失窃的实验室仪器
And the theft of lab equipment from your school

6
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:18,055
也将是我们的工作重心
Is also receiving our highest attention.

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,047
请放心  我们会不遗余力地
Rest assured, no stone will go unturned

8
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:24,024
寻找这些事情的相关负责人员
In our search for the person or persons responsible for this.

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:27,025
如果你们还有什么疑问  现在就提出来
If you have any questions, now would be the time.

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,013
你说话的口气好像你们还没有抓到人
You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet.

11
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:33,076
那个在学校里交易毒品的看门人呢
What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school?

12
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:37,058
没有任何迹象表明此人在出售毒品
There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs.

13
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:38,087
他被捕的原因是
He was arrested for having

14
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:41,052
在其车中找到少量大麻
a small amount of marijuana in his car.

15
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,012
并不是在学校里
Not in the school.

16
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:44,038
而且他因此被开除了
And he's since been fired.

17
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,028
我听说他有前科
I heard he had a record.

18
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:48,074
我想知道当初他是怎么会被聘用
I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place.

19
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,050
没错  为什么没有调查背景  
Exactly. Why wasn't there a background check?

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,090
有过
There was one.

21
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:55,017
我们正在复查聘用政策
We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.

22
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:56,080
你们还要做得更好
You better be doing more than that.

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,010
那人是在我女儿面前被逮捕的
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,032
那个人在偷实验室仪器  对吗
This guy was stealing the lab equipment, right?

25
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:03,037
现在  我们并不这么认为
That's not our thinking at this time.

26
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:05,065
而是在寻找同样能有接触途径的人
We are looking at others who also had access,

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,025
但不局限于维修职工
But not limited to the maintenance staff.

28
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,088
你是说有人非法闯入吗
Are you saying there was a break-in?

29
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:10,073
我们知道具体发生时间吗
Do we know exactly when this happened?

30
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:13,000
我想知道  是不是在上课时间
I mean, could it have been during school hours?

31
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,026
我们无法确定具体日期和时间
We haven't been able to establish a date or time,

32
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:17,039
不过没有任何闯入的迹象
But there is no sign of breaking or entering.

33
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,087
那么  那个人有钥匙
So...whoever took it had a key?

34
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:22,078
我们说的是监守自盗
We're talking inside job?

35
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:23,098
是学校内部人员吗
Someone who's still at the school?

36
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,089
目前  我无法跟你讨论细节问题
At this time I'm not able to discuss the details with you,

37
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,082
但是我可以告诉你的是
But we can tell you is that

38
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,098
我们有一批优秀的探员
We have some very good people

39
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:31,047
在调查这个案子
working very hard on this case.

40
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,014
对不起  长官  你的回答太含糊其词
I'm sorry, officer. But that sounds like double-talk.

41
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:35,092
我们在试图保护我们的孩子
We're trying to protect our children.

42
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,018
你们要和我们在同一条战线
You have to level with us.

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,010
实际上  我们提供了手头所有的信息
Really, we are giving you all the information we have.

44
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,026
你知道我喜欢怎样的学校吗
You know what I'd like to see in this school?

45
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,061
没有毒品
Drug never does.

46
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:45,095
没错  不能有缉毒犬  金属探测器
Yeah, dogs, and metal detectors,

47
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:48,006
还有不能搜查储物柜和连环漫画
And locker searches, and strip searches.

48
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,068
我们区有严格的政策
Our district has strict policies...

49
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,047
我在加拿大时听说一家学校
I heard about this school in Canada.

50
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:54,034
逮捕了一位携带毒品的场地管理员
They arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs.

51
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:56,020
第二天发现
And the next day they found out over

52
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,010
超过半数的学生服过大量迷幻药
Half of the students were high on LSD.

53
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:01,003
迷幻药  你打算什么时候告诉我们迷幻药的事情
LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD?

54
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:04,053
没有  没人说迷幻药
No. please. No one said anything about LSD.

55
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,097
被偷的仪器怎么样
What about the equipment that was stolen?

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,032
仪器是从我们的化学实验室被偷
The equipment was taken from our chemistry department.

57
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,056
我希望有人能说下详细情况
And I would like someone to give us some specifics.

58
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,054
沃尔特
Walt?

59
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:23,079
我在
Yeah.

60
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:28,003
怀特先生正在休病假
Mr. White is currently on medical leave.

61
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,087
但是他负责科学部的事务
But as he's chair of the science department,

62
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:34,015
他作出了很多特殊贡献
He's made a very special effort to be with us here.

63
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:38,014
首先我要感谢他
And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that.

64
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,094
您能不能跟我们说下
Could you please tell us more

65
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,064
被偷的实验仪器情况吗
About the equipment that was taken?

66
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,081
-有请  -好的
- Please. - Yes.

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,014
谢谢大家

Where... did that come from?

76

为什么TMD这么爽
And why was it so damn good?

77
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,082
因为这是非法行为
Because it was illegal.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,050
绝

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,050

但是看下这些空间
But just look at all this space.

你可以把这里想成是娱乐室  媒体室

想象一下你能在这里做的所有事情
Just imagine all the things you could do down here.

97

请记住  你们是因为优美的环境才买这个房子

离乡村俱乐部只有步行的距离

小修了一下  不过这幢房子框架很好
Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones.

看完这个  我还有很多

和你看到的一样好
About as good as you look.

Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

113
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,048
我到医院看望过你  不过你在昏迷
Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep.

114
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,075
没错  瘦子彼得说你想要屠库的地址
Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address.

115
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:01,082
好像要去报复人家
Acting like you were all out for blood.

116
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:05,071
你还活着  很明显你没去是明智的
You are alive, so obviously you wised up.

117
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,037
-不  我真的去见他了  -胡说

Are you selling your house?

119

放厕所里冲走
And flushed down my toilet.

00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,095
我都没法打扫卫生
I can't even take a proper dump in there.

122
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:20,004
整幢该死的房子现在一定在闹鬼
The whole damn house has got to be haunted by now.

123
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:24,032
你不会真的去见屠库吧
You didn't actually go see Tuco?

124
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,053
给你
Here.

125

正好是35000的一半

另外还有15000  也都归你了

是你赚来了
You've earned it.

129

你从屠库那里拿的
You got this money from Tuco.

130
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,062
你想说的就是屠库给你钱
So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.

131
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,066
-我们做了个交易  -你们做交易
- We made a deal. - You made a deal?

132
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,009
-没错  -等等
- That's right. - Wait.

133
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:52,065
你为什么要和那个小人做交易
Why would you make a deal with that scumbag?

134
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,097
你看到他是怎么对我的吗
You see what he did to me?

135
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:57,000
因为我觉得我们可以合伙做生意
Because I think that we can do business together.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,020
我们达成了共识
We came to an understanding.

137
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:01,063
没门  知道吗  你们之间没有共识
No way, man! Okay? No understanding.

138
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:03,076
看看你手上的钱
Take a look at the money in your hand.

139
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:07,035
想想每周都能赚这么多
Now just imagine making that every week.

140
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,091
没错
That's right.

141
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,028
每周2磅  每磅卖35000
Two pounds a week. 35,000 a pound.

142
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,012
你都没跟我打声招呼  你告诉
Without even talking to me, you told...

143
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:18,029
这个有病的傻瓜
This insane ass clown

144
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,058
瞎眼的杀手
Dead-eyed killer that, uh...

145
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,080
我们每周给他2磅
That we would give him two pounds a week?

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,050
我们是指适当扩大我们的运营
We'll just scale up our operation.

147
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,027
我们可以增加几小时
We'll add a few more hours...

148
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,076
别跟我说时间
Don't talk to me about hours.

149
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:32,028
如果他在骗你呢  我们怎么拿到钱
What about pseudo, man? How are we gonna get that?

150
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,094
你以为冰毒小精灵会拿给我们吗
You think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us?

151
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:39,002
我花了一周时间去弄这些原料
It takes me a week to get this stuff.

152
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,056
我在拉斯·克鲁塞斯奔来跑去
I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces.

153
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:44,066
来回200英里去跟马甲接头
200 miles each way to meet up with my smurfs...

154
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:48,011
-马甲  -去杂货店的那家伙
- Smurfs?  - The dudes who go to the drugstores,

155
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,097
一次拿上几盒再卖给我
And get a couple boxes at a time and sell them to me.

156
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,068
那估计就只有
And that's maybe only good for,

157
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:54,035
大概半磅重
Like, maybe a half pound worth.

158
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:58,042
看见了么  这就是你绝妙商业计划中的瓶颈
See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan.

159
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,019
好了
All right.

160
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,017
当然  你要是事先问我
Of course you would have known that

161
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:02,097
你早就知道了
If you would have just asked me.

162
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:06,053
嗯  我们又见面了
Well, here we are again.

163
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,027
是啊又见面了
Here we are.

164
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,040
-斯凯勒  你气色不错  -谢谢
- Skyler, you look great. - Thank you.

165
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,093
你这应该差不多有六  七个月了吧
You must be, what, six, seven months?

166
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,066
感觉怎样
How goes it?

167
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,002
还不错
It's great...

168
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:19,010
就是每五分钟就要蹒跚着去厕所
Other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.

169
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,080
下周要开宝宝派对  所以
The baby shower's next week. It'll be good to...

170
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,080
最好能让斯凯勒享受一次
It'll be good to have a day that's...

171
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,059
属于她自己的一天
Just about Skyler.

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,076
挺体贴
Very nice.

173
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,068
谢谢
Thank you.

174
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,045
沃尔特  我看你好像适应了掉发
Well, Walt, I see you've committed to the hair loss.

175
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,044
是啊
Yeah.

176
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,050
-你感觉怎样呢  -还行
- How do you feel? - Oh, okay.

177
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,021
其实很有形象
You know, pretty decent actually.

178
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,042
他气色好多了  你看
His color is better. You know, his energy.

179
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:47,086
他体力方面也
And he's even more...

180
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,015
好多了
Physical.

181
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:51,060
体力方面
More physical?

182
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,023
呃  性方面
Well... sexual.

183
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,013
活分一些
Frisky, actually.

184
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,084
我是说  这是个好兆头吧  对吗
I mean, that's got to be a good sign, right?

185
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,036
当然  我也这么认为
Sure, I'll take that.

186
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,066
对吗  沃尔特
Right, Walt?

187
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,007
那是不是意味着化疗起作用了
Couldn't that mean that the Chemo is working?

188
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,068
可能只表明
It may just mean that we've got

189
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:13,026
止吐药的药效到了
The anti-emetics tuned right.

190
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:16,066
说实话  要等到沃尔特完成这一阶段的化疗
Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of Chemo.

191
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,092
再做个正子扫描  现在还不能下定论
And we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure.

192
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:21,091
我们还要不要做其它什么呢
Isn't there anything else we could be doing?

193
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:24,016
我一直再考虑关于
I've been wondering about...

194
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,065
辅助药物
Alternative medicine.

195
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,018
就是  中医一类的
I mean, Eastern Healing.

196
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,020
疗效全面一些
You know, holistic.

197
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,074
这个  我不好说它功效如何
Well, I can't speak to its efficacy.

198
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:36,092
但是只要它不影响我们的疗法
But as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment,

199
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,077
一切能够带给病人希望
Anything that helps my patient have a better outlook,

200
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:43,005
带给他们健康的东西  我都欢迎
A better comfort, is fine by me.

201
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:47,014
那么你是指其实是心理作用
So you're saying it's all psychological.

202
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,033
不会有什么效果
It doesn't make any real difference.

203
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:54,004
只要有希望  结果也许大不相同
Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference.

204
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,091
调整自我的期望值也很重要
But it's also important that we manage our expectations.

205
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:19,064
怎么
What?

206
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,013
垃圾场
A junkyard?

207
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:29,043
我来猜猜  是你选的地方
Let me guess, you picked this place?

208
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,004
这里怎么了  够私密
What's wrong with it? It's private.

209
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:38,004
这就像  良民想出来的交货地点
This is like... a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet.

210
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,069
就像  "哇  我在电影里见过  哇  看着我"
This is like, "Oh, I saw this in a movie. Oh, look at me."

211
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:44,083
那么你在哪儿做交易  教教我
So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.

212
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,032
不晓得  塔克卡贝萨餐厅怎么样
I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza?

213
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:51,006
我有一半交易都是在那里完成的
Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza.

214
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:52,073
舒服  公开
Nice and public.

215
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,003
24小时营业
Open 24 hours.

216
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,047
从没有人在那儿被捉到过
Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.

217
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,060
妈的  为什么不去商店街呢
Hell, why not the mall?

218
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,048
在过道等着  "喂  见面时间到了"
You know, wait at the gap. "Hey!  It's time for the meet."

219
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:08,094
我先放下无褶卡其裤
You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis,

220
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:11,038
头转过去  拿一杯柳橙汁
Head on over, grab an orange julius.

221
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:14,086
跳过疯子屠库哪个部分
Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco

222
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,079
偷了我的药  
You know, comes and steals my drugs

223
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,065
还把我打得血流不止
and leaves me bleeding to death.

224
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,095
听着  你不必呆在这里
Look, you don't have to be here for this.

225
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,022
知道吗  我认真的
Okay? I mean, seriously.

226
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:34,059
我没事
I'm okay.

227
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,031
切  我又不是懦夫
Nah, I'm no pussy.

228
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,012
我好得很
I'm good.

229
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,085
洁癖先生和他的伙计
Mr. Clean and his boy.

230
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:06,000
抱歉我要先跟你们磨合一下
I'm sorry that I had to tune you up.

231
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:09,001
相互尊重  你们要先付出才能得到
Respect, ese. You gotta give it to get it.

232
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,067
我们在这做什么
Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here?

233
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:18,039
怎么  他们把购物街关了
What, they close the mall or something?

234
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,057
海森堡  拜托  直截了当一点
Heisenberg, come on, break it out.

235
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,065
就这些  你就只有这么多
That's it? That's all you got?

236
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,069
我们制作方面出了点问题
We had some production problems.

237
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,002
0.53磅
Point five-three.

238
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,020
我觉得你玩了我们
I thought you was a player.

239
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,055
你告诉过我两磅的
You told me two pounds.

240
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:41,069
现在你用这些口香糖似的东西浪费我时间
And now you waste my time with these Chiclets?

241
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,018
一万七千五
Seventeen and a half..

242
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,061
减掉的五百是赔我耗的时间
Minus the half for wasting my time.

243
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:58,062
拜托
Hey, come on.

244
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,037
怎么你还想讨价还价  
What, you're gonna argue?

245
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,019
你还有什么可说吗
You got something to say?

246
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,025
你们做事就像俩小婊子
You're doing business like a couple little bitches.

247
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,048
把钱给足了
I want all of it.

248
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:15,041
七万块
70 grand.

249
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,099
你说什么
What did you say?

250
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:20,012
你中意这批货  还想要更多
You like this product, and you want more.

251
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,074
当做投资吧
Consider it a capital investment.

252
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,029
草你妈的  你个秃子
Loco bald motherfucker.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,068
五万二再加五百  二十五点的周利
Fifty-two and a half. 25 points vig.

254
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,037
周利
Vig?

255
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,041
利息  按周计算
Interest. Weekly.

256
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,002
行
Okay.

257
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,039
那应该是
That's...

258
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:52,017
本息一共65,625美元  
$65,625 with interest.

259
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,012
-1.875磅  -不行
- 1.875 pounds. - No.

260
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:57,041
两磅  下周五拿
2 pounds. Next friday.

261
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,055
别给我出乱子
And no production problems.

262
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,013
你想不想要四磅
Can you handle 4 pounds?

263
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:11,013
听着  老头  说归说
Listen, old man. Talk is talk.

264
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:13,066
要是欠我钱的话
But owing me money...

265
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,066
后果很严重的
That's bad.

266
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:40,089
你刚刚干了什么
What did you just do?

267
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,027
四磅
4 pounds.

268
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:49,053
四磅  两磅还不够折腾啊
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds wasn't bad enough.

269
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:53,092
那相当于二三百盒的鼻窦炎药片
We're talking 200-300 boxes of sinus pills.

270
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,048
世界上可没那么多马甲
There ain't that many smurfs in the world.

271
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,088
我们这次不用假麻黄素
We're not going to need Pseudo-ephedrine.

272
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:01,063
我们要在管式炉里合成苯丙酮
We're going to make phenylacetone in a tube furnace,

273
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:04,002
再利用还原性氨化反应
Then we're gonna use Reductive Amination

274
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,037
来生成甲基苯丙胺[即冰毒]
to yield Methamphetamine.

275
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,068
-不用假麻黄素  -不用
- So no Pseudo? - No Pseudo.

276
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,005
你还是有个计划啊
So you do have a plan.

277
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:13,013
太好了  怀特先生
Yeah, Mr. White!

278
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,009
科学真伟大
Yeah, science!

279
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:16,075
好了
Okay.

280
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:23,078
-这是什么  -购物清单
- What's this?  - That is a shopping list.

281
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:28,010
要搞到其中一些可能有点挑战性
Getting some of those items may be challenging.

282
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:32,037
"一台自耦变压器  六升的
"One autotransformer, 6 liters an...

283
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:36,035
水  水合甲  甲胺
Hy... Hydrous Methyl... Methylamine,

284
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:39,056
两台35m和m的口径管式炉"
Two 35 m&m tube furnaces..."

285
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,092
m和m是指毫米
It's mm, millimeter.

286
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:43,008
一个70毫米的最好
One 70-millimeter would be fine,

287
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,075
但是它们组合起来很难
But they're hard to combine.

288
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:47,027
"40克硝酸钍"
"40 grams Thorium Nitrate"?

289
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,082
喂  怀特先生  这些屁东西我读都读不清楚
Yo, Mr. white, I can't even pronounce half this shit.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,059
告诉你  我不玩了
You know what?  Count me out.

291
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,000
我要离开镇子
I'm leaving town.

292
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,012
我要搬去  俄勒冈州之类的
I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something...

293
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,005
杰西  杰西  听我说
Jesse, Jesse, listen to me.

294
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,051
今天只是你未来生活的开始
Today is the first day of the rest of your life.

295
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,069
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

296
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,084
这是你余生的伊始
This is the first day of the rest of your life,

297
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,086
而你的余生会是怎样的
But what kind of life will it be?

298
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,060
是充满恐惧的余生  
Will be be a life of fear,

299
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,069
尽想着"不  不  我做不了"的生活  
Of "oh, no, no, no, "I can't do this,"

300
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,039
从不相信自己的生活吗
Of never once believing in yourself?

301

现在  你肯定已经知道我了
Now, of course you already know that because

308
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,081
因为20年后你看这录像时
When you watch this twenty years from now

309
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:45,067
我还会和现在一模一样

我知道这挺不可思议
I know it is amazing.

311
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,067
岁月对我不起作用  不是吗
I have aged shockingly well, haven't I?

312
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,038
总之
Anyway,

321
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,037
别  转回来对着我
Not... back to me.

别疯了
Easy.

328
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,093
不管你信不信  梅拉达
Believe it or not, Esmeralda,

329
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,080
庆祝完后  你的名字要改成霍莉
Right after the party, your name was changed to Holly.

330
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,016
而且我相信  汉克  那也是
And I believe, Hank, that was around the time

331
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,060
把你姨妈送进精神病院的时候
That we took aunt Marie to the insane asylum.

332
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,016
对  对  我把她扔在路边
Yeah, yeah. I dropped her off at the curb.

333
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:45,022
然后我就和仙妮娅·特恩结婚  
Then I married Shania Twain

334
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,060
并从此过上幸福的生活
And lived happily ever after.

跟你女儿打个招呼

339
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,069
无论你去哪
Wherever you go,

这是
It's a...

359
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,070
头饰

00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:22,002
玛丽  这是不是

361
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:26,060
白金嵌着几克拉锆石
White gold and several carats' worth of zircons.

362
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,006
玛丽  你太破费了
Oh, Marie, you spent too much on this.

363
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:32,044
你不该这样的  真的
You shouldn't have. You really, really shouldn't.

364
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,014
不过这个  真的
But it's so... it's really...

365
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:38,010
很耀眼
It's... sparkly.

366

闪闪发光  谢谢你
Sparkly! Like wow! Thank you.

367
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,091
沃尔特  听着
Hey, listen, Walt...

368
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,010
有比啤酒烈的吗
You got anything stronger than beer?

369
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,020
这是太棒了
It's just gor... oh, it's great.

370
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,031
我很喜欢  谢谢你
I love it. Thank you.

371
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,045
谢谢你  亲爱的  谢谢
Thank you, sweetie, thank you.

372
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,025
抱歉  伙计
Sorry, man.

373
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,012
看了200份礼物之后  有点无趣
You know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old.

374
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,056
-真是好酒  -可不是吗
- That's nice stuff. - It is, isn't it?

375
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,052
我这正好有配好酒的东西
I got just the thing to go with that.

376
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:17,022
对不起  我刚没想到
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

377
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,017
不  不  不  没事
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

378
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,032
我能来一支吗
You mind if I have one?

379
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:24,052
你觉得这样好吗
You think it's a good idea?

380
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,098
汉克  我已经得了肺癌了
Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

381
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:31,028
好吧  有道理
Okay. You got me there.

382
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,064
谢谢
Thanks.

383
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,009
我帮了个联邦探员的忙
I did a little favor for an FBI guy.

384
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,088
我有种感觉
Now, I was under the impression...

385
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:55,055
这雪茄不合法  是吧
That these were illegal, hmm?

386
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,041
对  可有时候
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit

387
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,080
禁果才最甜  不是吗
Tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

388
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,040
很可笑  不是吗
It's funny, isn't it?

389
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,090
我们怎么划定界限
How we draw that line.

390
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:12,003
什么
Yeah?

391
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:14,065
什么界限
What line is that?

392
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,089
就是  什么合法  什么不合法
Well, what's legal, what's illegal,

393
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,095
古巴雪茄  酒
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

394
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:26,004
你知道  如果是在1930年喝酒
You know, if we were drinking this in 1930,

395
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,039
我们就违法了
We'd be breaking the law.

396
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:31,002
换个时间  又合法了
Another year, we'd be okay.

397
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,018
谁知道明年又有什么会变合法
Who knows what will be legal next year?

398
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:39,061
你是说像大麻
You mean like pot?

399
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,032
像大麻  或者
Like pot. Or...

400
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,037
之类的
Whatever.

401
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,024
可卡因  海洛因
Cocaine? Heroin?

402
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:55,097
我就是随口一说
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

403
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,034
那你该去监狱看看
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

404
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,000
那里有很多人这么说
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.

405
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:05,098
伙计  你就为14包大麻抓我啊
"hey, man, why'd you bust me with these 14 bales of ganja?

406
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,005
等明年威利·纳尔逊当总统时
"It's all gonna be legal next year

407
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,098
这可就不犯法了
When Willie Nelson be the president"

408
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,085
老兄  这话也能反过来说
Shit, buddy, it doesn't only go one way, either.

409
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:17,086
有时候  所谓合法的东西并不该合法化
Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be.

410
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,082
我是指  那混账的冰毒曾经合法
I mean, friggin' meth used to be legal.

411
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:24,060
曾经在美国的任何一家
Used to sell it over every counter

412
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,056
药房的柜台里都有出售
At every pharmacy across America

413
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:30,016
感谢上帝  他们知道该禁毒了
Thank god they came to their senses on that one, huh?

414
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,064
对
Yeah.

415
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,020
聚会很棒
Nice party.

416
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,040
一个头冠
A tiara.

417
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,092
给一个新生儿送白金头冠
A white gold tiara for a newborn baby.

418
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,009
是啊
Yeah.

419
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,062
我觉得她是在
You know, I think she got that at

420
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,046
格特鲁德·扎克瑞里买的
Gertrude Zachary produced, yes

421
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,075
我是说  这东西肯定得
I mean, that thing must have cost, like, what,

422
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:11,003
500还是600吧
$500 or $600.

423
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,075
我觉得我该退掉它
You know what? I think I'm going to return it.

424
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,002
你想好了吗
You sure?

425
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:20,009
她肯定会发现的
She's bound to find out.

426
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,090
也许我能跟她解释说
Well, maybe I can explain to her that

427
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,057
比起白金的婴儿头饰
We need a diaper than

428
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:27,096
我们更需要尿布
A white gold baby tiara.

429
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,073
我在想
You know, I've been thinking about

430
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:34,059
你对戴尔克沃利医生说的话
What you said Dr. Delcavoli

431
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,093
关于辅助的疗法
About alternative medicine.

432
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:39,035
不  别担心  我再不会提那事了
No. Don't worry. I'm not going to mention that anymore.

433
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:44,010
不是  我是想说  也许这可行呢
No. What I mean is that maybe there is something to it.

434
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,018
看  这个
Here. look.

435
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:50,098
在法明顿有这种印第安人的净汗屋
They do this navajo sweat lodge up by farmington.

436
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:53,083
治疗仪式

437
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:55,096
据说对肺有好处
It's supposed to be good for your lungs.

438
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:58,066
不是说我真的信  只是
I'm not saying that I believe in it, but...

439
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,073
你看  或许有有益处
You know, it might be an experience.

440
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,031
你说真的
Really?

441
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,010
你
You?

442
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:09,058
去汗屋
In a sweat lodge?

443
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:12,080
我打算周五开车过去  周日回来
I was thinking about driving up on Friday,

如果你同意的话

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
死贵
It was expensive.

455
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:56,017
甲胺呢  甲胺在哪里
Methylamine. Where's the methylamine?

456
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,006
怎么没看到甲胺
I don't see the methylamine.

457
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:00,052
那个  有点儿麻烦
Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.

458
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:02,072
什么麻烦
What kind of trouble?

459
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:05,074
这里一半破烂是可以直接买
Well, half this crap I could just buy, right?

460
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,093
但是这个甲胺
But this methylamine...

461
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,048
就不容易搞
Not so easy.

462
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,057
都在仓库里锁着呢
They got it locked down tight.

463
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:16,006
有几个行家愿意去搞
But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.

464
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:18,062
他们开价1万块
But they want 10 grand.

465
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:20,088
那有什么问题  你钱够的
So what's the problem? You have the money.

466
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:24,006
原来是够  都差不多花光了
No, had. I already spent almost the whole wad.

467
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:25,082
我手头剩下两千
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.

468
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:28,005
跟你说了  这些破烂贵着呢
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

469
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:31,009
那么  那些贼有没有说过
So these thieves, did they say where

470
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,070
他们打算从哪儿偷
They would be stealing it from?

471
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,050
城南一个化学品仓库
Yeah, a chemical supply place south of town.

472
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:37,093
有警卫  监视录像
They got guards and security cameras,

473
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,068
高门大锁
Big ass steel doors.

474
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:42,026
所以他们才狮子大开口
That's why these dudes are charging so much.

475
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:44,029
看什么呢
What?

476
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,055
我们何不自己动手
So why don't we just steal it ourselves?

477
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,060
说真的
Yeah?

478
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:07,039
我们怎么动手
How are we going to do that?

479
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,040
用这个
With this.

480
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,065
这玩意叫啥来着
So what's this stuff called again?

481
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,089
铝热剂
Thermite.

482
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,082
这东西能破锁吗
And that will cut through a lock?

483
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:37,041
那锁头可是大家伙
Because this is supposed to be one big ass lock.

484
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,042
二战时期
In World War II,

485
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,019
德国人造了一门超级大炮
The Germans had an artillery piece,

486
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,002
它是世界上最大的炮
It's the biggest in the world.

487
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,014
称作"古斯塔夫巨炮"
Called the Gustav Gun,

488
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,093
有一千吨重
And it weighed a thousand tons.

489
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:53,041
古斯塔夫巨炮的炮弹重7吨
And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7-ton shell

490
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:57,067
能精确集中23英里外的目标
And hitting a target accurately 23 miles away.

491
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,087
要是用炸弹去炸
I mean, you could drop bombs on it

492
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:06,014
连续炸上一个月也无济于事
Every day for a month without ever disabling it.

493
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,077
但如果派突击队
But you drop a commando,

494
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:11,082
只需一个人
One man,

495
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,017
一袋这个
With just a bag of this...

496
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:20,003
就能熔化4英寸的钢铁
And he could melt right through 4 inches of solid steel

497
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:22,003
让那门炮彻底完蛋
And destroy that gun forever.

498
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,074
神哪
Jeez!

499
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:31,053
所以说
So yes.

500
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,009
什么样的锁都能破
I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.

501
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,095
你要把这个退掉
You'd like to return this?

502
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:41,059
它很漂亮  但我要退
It's very nice, but yes.

503
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,068
它是你们店的  没错吧
Well, it is from the store, isn't it?

504
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:47,004
没错  真是本店的
Oh, yes. It's from this store.

505
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,060
你有发票吗
Do you happen to have a receipt?

506
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:52,074
没有  别人送的
No. I don't. It was a gift.

507
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,055
送的
A gift.

508
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:57,032
威尔逊先生  麻烦过来下
Mr. Wilson, could you step over here, please?

509
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:01,067
威尔逊先生  请你看住这位女士
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady

510
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,068
我去报警
While I find the police.

511
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,049
你说什么
Excuse me?

512
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,080
女士  这是件被盗的赃物  我相信你也了解
Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know.

513
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,046
请跟我来
Come with me, please.

514
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:16,049
是的  我要起诉
Oh, yes. I intend to press charges.

515
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,067
好的
Please do.

516
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,034
我们在这等
We'll be here.

517
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,009
听我说  我
Look, I...

518
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:28,097
我这辈子从没偷过东西
I've never stolen anything in my life, all right?

519
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:30,054
我说了
I told you.

520
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,052
这头饰是别人送的  新生儿派对礼物
That tiara was a gift. A baby shower gift.

521
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:36,069
那是谁送的呢
So who gave it to you, then?

522
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,036
我有权不告诉你
I don't think I have to tell you that.

523
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:42,003
你有权什么都不告诉我
You don't have to tell me anything.

524
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,083
你跟警察讲
You can talk to the police,

525
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,067
而我要告诉他们  我儿媳清楚地记得
And I can tell them how my daughter-in-law remembers

526
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:50,009
她把头饰拿给一位高个金发女士看
Showing this particular item to a tall blonde woman who,

527
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:53,014
可是她刚一转身  那女士就拿着它走掉了
When her back was turned, walked right out the door with it.

528
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,017
这就是证据
So there.

529
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:55,090
是嘛
Oh, yeah?

530
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,006
那我就对3套新闻台说去
Then I can talk to the channel 3 news.

531
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,024
我要告诉他们  你们这些人
Yeah. I can tell them how you people,

532
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,026
在没有一丝一毫证据的情况下
Without a shred, without a modicum of evidence,

533
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:09,017
非法将一名无辜孕妇拘留
Illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman

534
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,010
在黑暗的储藏室里
In a dank storeroom.

535
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,022
-这是我的办公室  -我认为这是绑架
- This is my office. - I feel I'm being held hostage.

536
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:19,032
而且  这里空气不够
Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here.

537
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:21,040
我喘不过气
I don't think I can breathe.

538
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,099
哦  上帝呀
Oh, my God.

539
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:26,000
哦不  我要生了
Oh, no. I'm going into labor.

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,031
我要
Yes, I...

541
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:41,032

我要马上跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you immediately.

544
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:52,095
警卫呢  他该过来了
Where's the guard? He's supposed to be coming by.

545
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:56,029
-他是不是已经过去了  -我不知道
- You think he already passed? - I don't know.

546
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,058
-他来了  -我看见他了
- There he is. - Yeah, I see him.

547
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:02,037
等他过去
Wait till he passes.

548
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,010
安全了
Okay, it's clear.

549
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:14,075
-这是什么玩意儿  -店里只有这个
- What the hell is this? - It's all they had.

550
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,039
那就去别的店
Then you go to another store.

551
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,042
-只有这个说明你去错店了  -戴上
- If this is all they had, wrong place. - Just put it on.

552
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:21,014
你真应该
Of course you can...

553
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:32,048
成了  我们开始
Okay. This is it.

554
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,012
老天
Oh, God.

555
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,006
-该死  躲起来  -怎么回事
- Dawm. Where... duck. Duck. - What?

556
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:01,023
他不该回来的  他在做什么
He's not supposed to come back. What's he doing?

557
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,098
老天
Oh, God.

558
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:07,031
他要去茅厕
He's going to the crapper.

559
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,040
老天
Oh, God.

560
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,091
-背上兜子  -你要干嘛

561
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,055
好了  就是这
Okay, there is it.

562
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,036
声音大不大
Is this going to be loud?

563
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,074
马上就知道了
We'll find out in about ten seconds.

564
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,025
往后站
Stand back.

565
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:00,060
我的神
Jesus!

566
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,058

00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:24,091
-哪有加仑装的  -我不知道

569
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:30,045
我们拿这个走  快点  快
Let's just take this. Come on. Come on.

570
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:42,037
你开大门干什么
What the hell are you doing opening the door?

571
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:45,005
不然这东西怎么出去
How are we going to take this thing out?

572
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,069
需要听译

573
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,020
-你开我开有什么区别  -让我试试不行吗
- How is it going to be any different? - Can I just try it?

574
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,077
-行  行  你去吧  -我的神
- Fine, fine, go ahead. - Jesus. Okay.

575
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:40,070
成了宝贝儿  看看  怎么样
Yeah, baby. See? Eat it, okay?

576
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,073
我无敌了  我无敌了
I'm the king. I'm the king.

577
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,068
不不不  情况不妙
No, no, no. That didn't sound good.

578
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,032
好吧  这事没戏了
Well, this thing's not going anywhere.

579
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,004
事先说下  可不能在我车道上制毒啊  
We're not cooking in my damn driveway. I tell you that.

580
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,017
跟你说了慢点  听不懂人话吗
What part of slow it down did you not understand?

581
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:13,049
你说的太多了  太重了  伙计  你得等我
You talk too much. It's heavy, man. You got to wait for me.

582
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,078
好了
Okay.

583
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:18,084
就这样  就这样  现在竖起来
That's good, that's good. Now just bring it up.

584
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:21,040
慢点  慢点  慢点
Easy, easy, easy.

585
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,001
好了
Okay.

586
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,053
你的房产经纪人  啥时候回来
Your real estate agent, when is she supposed to come back?

587
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:28,007
糟糕
Shit.

588
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:30,038
我不清楚
Yo, I don't know.

589
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,087
我会确保她不回来
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

590
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,035
好主意
Good call, yo.

591
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:40,069
好吧
All right.

592
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:15,053
将温度保持在425华摄氏度
Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees.

593
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,064
我们需要制作两个多小时
We'll need to run it two more hours

594
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,098
保证有4.5磅的产量
Try to have enough to make 4.5 Pounds.

595
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,051
4.5  不是4吗
4.5? Not 4?

596
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,081
2磅用来还屠库
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

597
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:31,000
4.5磅能为我们带来可观的收入
4.5 pounds puts us $44,000 ahead...

598
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,024
每磅44000美元
Each.

599
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,090
太对了  伙计
Right on, man.

600
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,002
对极了
Right on.

601
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:38,086
再加上昨晚我们弄来的那些甲胺
With the amount of methylamine that we got last night,

602
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,068
不久的将来
We could make 4.5 pounds a week for...

603
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,048
我们每周能制出个4.5磅来
Well, for the foreseeable future.

604

只是
It just wasn't...

629

玛丽  你怎么了
Marie, what is wrong with you?

能告诉我你这么做的原因吗
Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing?

我只是想看看地下室  有什么大不了的
I just want to see the basement. What's the big deal?

当然
Yeah.

654
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,044
绝对算是一种体验吗
It was definitely an experience.

655
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:49,089
什么味道
What's that smell?

656
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,014
是一种

我被捕了还把皇冠还了回去
I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store.

666
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,048
天哪
Oh, my god.

667
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:43,041
她拒绝承认  拒绝道歉
She refuses to admit it. She refuses to apologize.

668
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,048
我都无所适从了
I don't know what to do.

669
00:41:50,014 --> 00:41:51,021
好吧
Oh, well.

这么说  偷东西还有理了
And, what, that justifies stealing?

673
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,070
算是吧
Yeah.

674
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,099
那儿肯定有些蒸汗室
That must have been some sweat lodge.

675
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:14,004
你会听信
Are you gonna listening to the

676
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:16,076
她说的话吗
Words coming out of her mouth?

677
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:22,019
如果是我你会怎么办
What would you do if it were me?

678
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:26,085
什么意思
What do you mean if it were you?

如果偷东西的是我  你会怎么办

还是把我揭发去警局
Would you turn me in to the police?

00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:46,059
你不会想知道的
You don't want to find out.

00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:00,056
想吃点什么吗
Do you want something to eat?

不用  谢谢
No, thanks.

685
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:24,069
这玩意是什么  居然是蓝色的
What is this shit? This is blue.

686
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,099

00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:30,058
但从没这么纯过
But it is ever been that's pure

688
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:33,013

我说啥来着  这家伙能制毒
And what did I say, man? This guy can cook!

695
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:10,031
你说得对  说得对
You're all right, man. You're all right.

696
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:13,013
我们合作能赚好多钱

我只是说说  他们得清楚
I'm just saying they got to know

700
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:24,081
是为你在卖命
That they're work for you

701
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:27,055
难道他们不清楚这点吗
Like they don't already know that?

702
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:30,043
说得好像他们很笨似的
Are you saying that they're stupid?

703
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,010
不  我只是  说说而已
No, I'm just... I'm just saying.

704
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:37,012
是吗  所以你并没说他们笨
Oh, yeah. So you're not saying that they're stupid.

705
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:40,027
我不明白了  你是在说我笨吗
So I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm stupid?

706

708
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,006
就像我不能说话似的
Like I ain't got the damn sense to speak for myself!

709
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:52,042
是这样吗  你是这个目的吧
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

710
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,062
屠库
Tuco.

711
00:44:58,006 --> 00:45:01,066
我们为啥不放轻松点呢
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

712
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:11,036
海森堡说放轻松
