不过在你打开进气阀之前

83
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,066

你来真的啊  这全是你做的
You're for real. This is all you?

93
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,015
独自做的
All me.

94

一边制毒  一边留意时局
I can cook, and I can watch.

108

别了  我觉得你可以了

真是太爽了  杰西
That is awesome, Jesse.

119
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:34,080
感觉就像有人把我的大脑拿走
I feel like somebody took my brain out

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,063
然后放在沸水中去煮一样
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot--

121
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,047
说真的  老兄  这简直太棒了
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

122
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,044
简直就像是炭疽

很好
Good.

124

那...你们想谈点生意了吗

00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:53,062
你是说  这不只是在消遣吗
You mean, this is not, like, just... recreational?

126
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:59,059
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

127
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:02,099
相信我  不会再和以前一样了

128
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,073
好吗  永远都不会和以前一样了
All right, never gonna be like it was.

129
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,074
那怎么可能
How's that?

130
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:08,016

We sell it safe.

131
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,067
好吗  我们聪明点去卖掉它
All right? We sell it smart.

132
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,000
我们不要像之前那样贪婪了
We don't get greedy... like before.

133
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,077
我不知道  老兄

大家都得生存
Man's gotta make his living.

137
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:33,062
如果能像杰西说的那样
If it's like Jesse says

138
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,036
我们不再贪婪
and we're not greedy...

139
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,013
我是说  我想是能成功的
I mean, I guess I can see it.

140
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,053
在我们开始碰运气之前
Had a good thing going

141
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,076
好事情就已经发生了
before we started pushing our luck.

142
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,060
是的
Yeah.

143
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,026
如果能做到那样个子的话
If it can go back to being like that and all--

144
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,000
嘿 肯定会的
Hey, it will be.

145
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:49,084
首先  我们编制一个存货清单

把房车开到隐蔽的地方
Get the RV in shape,

148
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,018
整修一下  润滑油
tune up, oil change,

149
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,098
刹车灯  之类的东西
brake lights, and whatnot.

150
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,018
警察总是因为刹车灯让你靠边停下
Cops always pull you over for brake lights.

151
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:59,091
不能是我们
Not us.

152
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,005
谨慎小心
Cautious.

153
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,035

154
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,092
好了  你知道那个警报器吧
All right, you know that buzzer thing.

155
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,000
在点火时拔掉钥匙
Leave the key in the ignition,

156
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,006
它就会响  无所谓了
and it buzzes, whatever.

157
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,046
-是的  -让他给也装上一个那东西
- Yeah. - Just have him put in one of those, too.

158
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,076
瘦子你来负责供给
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,013
我会给你列个清单
I'll get you a list.

160
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,077
听你差遣
Right on.

161
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,090
行吗
Yeah?

162
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,010
-行  -那这事定了
- Yeah. - All right.

163
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:26,007
那么  我们说好了
So, uh... we good?

164
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,014
-嗯  -没问题吧
- Yeah. - We good?

165
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,031
-挺你  伙计  -那就定了
- Right on, man. - All right.

166
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:31,045
我们干它一票
Let's do this thing.

167
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:47,046
布兰登·梅休
Brandon Mayhew.

168
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,020
我知道你的好事
I know you.

169
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:53,007
阿尔布开克真小啊
Small world, Albuquerque.

170
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,012
想要谈一下吗
Want to talk about it?

171
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,064
有什么好谈的  我没有发言权
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

172
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,006
你知道吗  讽刺得很
You know, ironically,

173
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,060
我想  从今往后  你会更加更加了解我这个人
I think you're going to see much more of me from now on.

174
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:13,047
-当然  -至少可以看到我真实的一面
- Sure. - Well, just as much of me at least.

175
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:16,034
我送你去学校  接你回来  以后天天如此
I'm taking you to the school, to and from, every day.

176
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,094
怎么  这事我也没发言权吗
What, I don't get a vote in this, either?

177
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,075
就因为你心存愧疚
I gotta stop going with Louis

178
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,012
我就不能跟路易斯上下学了吗
just because you're feeling guilty?

179
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,045
我是心存愧疚
I do feel guilty.

180
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:35,083
我就是这么一个人  孩子
I am the man that I am, son,

181
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:38,086
有许多地方我会改进  但是
and there's plenty I would change about that, but...

182
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:43,014
事已至此
here we are

183
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:46,010
你要接受现实
and this is just what it is.

184
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,064
知道么
You know what?

185
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,048
当我疯了吧
Call me crazy,

186
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:58,042
但我打心里觉得未来非常美好
but I'm actually feeling very good about the future.

187
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,062
早啊
Morning.

188
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:38,062
他们又回来了
They're back.

189
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,019
我就是在想
Uh, I'm just wondering

190
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,069
我们是否应该报警之类的
if we should maybe call the police or something.

191
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,066
为什么
Why?

192
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,077
他们又没干坏事
They're doing nothing wrong.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,047
好了  把这个摆到三十三号桌  行吗
Okay, let's put this on table 33, okay?

194
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:21,023
你好  这位先生
Hello, there.

195
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:25,023
你是怀特先生  对吗
Uh, Mr. White, I presume?

196
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,077
噢  是的  你好  真是...对不起
Oh, yes. Hi. I am-- Sorry.

197
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,037
我马上下来
I'll-- I'll be right down.

198
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:43,015
你好  我是盖尔·伯蒂彻
Hi. Gale Boetticher.

199
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,082
你好
Hi.

200
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,032
你是我新的实验助手  我猜想
You're my new lab assistant, I take it.

201
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,079
是的  我是
Yes, I am.

202
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:52,052
我觉得你会想要了解一下我的资质
I suppose you'll want to hear my qualifications.

203
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:55,019
我带来了我的简历  在这儿
I have my, uh-- my resume here for you.

204
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,037
我在新墨西哥大学拿到学士学位
I received my bachelor's degree from UNM,

205
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,010
研究生学位是在科罗拉多州大学
my master's from the University of Colorado.

206
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:07,004
有机化学系  专攻...
Organic chemistry with a specialty in--

207
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,067
都写在上面
It's all right there.

208
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:11,094
X射线结晶学
"X-ray crystallography."

209
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:13,059
是真的么
Really?

210
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,035
这玩意儿我可以连续说上好几个小时
I could talk about that for hours.

211
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,085
我愿意听你讲
I would love to.

212
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,052
但是  首先  我好奇这是什么
But, first, I'm curious about this.

213
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,086
这是我最喜爱的一个小项目
That's a little pet project of mine.

214
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,080
你看  我认为
See, in my opinion,

215
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,067
这全在于奎宁酸含量
it's all about the quinic acid level.

216
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,074
假设只想要每升提取四千八百毫克
You want just north of 4,800 milligrams per liter,

217
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,071
但是如果烧煮过度
but if you over-boil to get there,

218
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:42,037
丹宁酸会被滤掉
you're going to leach your tannins.

219
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,098
苦味跑了  难喝
Bitterness. Yuck.

220
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,028
所以  我给它抽了真空
So I pull a mild vacuum.

221
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,015
这样  我就可以把温度
That way, I can keep the temperature

222
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:52,018
控制在九十二摄氏度以内  还有...
no higher than 92 C, and uh...

223
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,006
我给你弄点儿
let's see.

224
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,099
由你自个儿来评判
Judge for yourself.

225
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:14,021
天哪
Oh, my God.

226
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,008
这是我喝过的最美味的咖啡
My God, that is the best coffee I've ever tasted.

227
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,085
苏门答腊岛的咖啡豆
Sumatran beans,

228
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,089
研磨的功夫也了得
and I also have to give credit to the grind,

229
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:34,086
总之  谢谢夸奖  怀特先生
but, uh, thank you, Mr. White.

230
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,066
沃尔特
Walt, please.

231
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,023
请叫我沃尔特
Call me Walt.

232
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:41,013
我们干吗还用得着制毒呢
Huh, why the hell are we making meth?

233
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:57,048
告诉我  用苯乙酸溶液
Tell me, with the phenylacetic acid solution,

234
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:02,001
你说过前十分钟是每分钟一百五十滴
you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes,

235
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:04,015
然后剩下的每分钟九十滴
and then 90 for the remainder.

236
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:05,098
这是为什么呢
Why is that?

237
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:09,025
我的想法是
Well, my thinking is,

238
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,034
通过逐渐减少苯基
by tapering the phenyl,

239
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:15,026
得到的涵水层更具油性  于是
you get an oilier aqueous layer, and hence--

240
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,070
苯的萃取物会更好
Better benzene extraction.

241
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:19,060
说得很对
Exactly.

242
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:21,093
不过我其实更倾向于乙醚
But actually I prefer ether.

243
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,090
噢  我明天用它试试
Oh. I'll have it for tomorrow.

244
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:34,075
盖尔  我在想  你是怎么...
Gale, I'm wondering how you--

245
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:36,085
沦落至此的
Ended up here.

246
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:39,075
尽管实际上  我还没想出来
Well, actually, I'm still wondering

247
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,039
我到底是怎么沦落到这儿的  但是  你呢
how I ended up here, but, yes.

248
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,049
我是说  我无法想象
I mean, I can't imagine

249
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,083
我俩锒铛入狱互殴的景象
we strike each other as criminals.

250
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:53,042
因为犯罪  所以犯罪
Well, there's crime, and then there's crime,

251
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,073
我这么认为
I suppose.

252
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:58,077
我是个绝对的自由意志论者
I'm definitely a libertarian.

253
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,057
赞成成年人的观点  想他们所想
Consenting adults want what they want,

254
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,007
况且即便我不提供帮助
and if I'm not supplying it,

255
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,048
他们也能找到别人
they will get it somewhere else.

256
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,091
可至少在我这里
At least with me,

257
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,031
他们肯定会物超所值
they're getting exactly what they pay for.

258
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:11,082
无杂质  不掺假
No added toxins or adulterants.

259
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,049
我曾经过着与自己身份相配的生活
Yeah, I was doing it the way you are supposed to,

260
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,032
在科大攻读博士学位
pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,

261
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,079
参与美国国家卫生基金会项目
NSF research grant.

262
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,016
我也曾得意一时
I was on my way,

263
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,020
做得比别人多  也受人器重
jumping through hoops, kissing the proper behinds,

264
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:29,057
专注于所有非化学的事情
attending to all the non-chemistry

265
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,094
搞得自己焦头烂额
that one finds oneself occupied with.

266
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:33,071
你了解那个圈子
You know that world.

267
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:36,061
那才不是我要的生活
That is not what I signed on for.

268
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:43,078
我喜欢实验室
I love the lab.

269
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:46,088
因为这里充满魔力
Because it's all still magic.

270
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:48,039
你明白吗
You know?

271
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:53,036
化学
Chemistry?

272
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,070
我的意思是  一旦失去那种...
I mean, once you lose that...

273
00:21:57,073 --> 00:22:01,067
确实是  这里是有魔力的地方
It is. It is magic.

274
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,027
现在依然如此
It still is.

275
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,067
从始至终我脑子里不断回想着
And all the while I kept thinking

276
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,067
那个伟大的老诗人惠特曼
about that great, old Whitman poem.

277
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,018
"当我聆听那位博学的天文学家讲座时"
"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."

278
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,075
沃尔特·惠特曼
Walt Whitman.

279
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:16,028
我,,,我不知道这首诗
I-- I don't know it.

280
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,005
那算了吧
Uh, anyway...

281
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:19,045
你能朗诵它吗
Well, can you recite it?

282
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:25,096
可悲得很  我能
Pathetically enough I could.

283
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:28,019
好呀  那你念来听听吧
All right, well...

284
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,073
别不好意思  念吧  念吧
No, no, come on. Come on.

285
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,000
我真念了
Yeah?

286
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,084
"当我聆听那位博学的天文学家讲座时
When I heard the learn'd astronomer;

287
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,013
当那些证明  数据一栏栏地
When the proofs, the figures,

288
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:45,090
排列在我眼前时
were ranged in columns before me;

289
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,058
当那些表格  图解展现在我眼前
When I was shown the charts and the diagrams,

290
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:51,055
要我去加  去减  去测定时
to add, divide, and measure them;

291
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:55,024
当我端坐聆听那位天文学家的演说
When I, sitting, heard the astronomer,

292
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:58,089
听着演说室里此起彼伏的掌声时
where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,

293
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:04,083
我竟莫名其妙的厌倦起来
How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick;

294
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:07,033
于是我起身悄悄地溜了出去
Till rising and gliding out,

295
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,060
在神秘而潮湿的夜风中
I wander'd off by myself,

296
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:13,071
踯躅前行
In the mystical moist night-air,

297
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,037
一遍又一遍
and from time to time,

298
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:19,098
在姣彻的寂静中仰望星空"
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

299
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,052
我承认  我是个书呆子
Yes, I am a nerd.

300
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,099
-太精彩了  -谢谢你
- Bravo. - Thank you.

301
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:40,080
来呀  平克曼
Come on, Pinkman.

302
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,000
你个鼠辈混球
You little rat busters.

303
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,054
别懒在屋子里  出来犯犯法
Get off your lazy ass and go break the law.

304
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:23,004
嘿  亲爱的
Hey, baby.

305
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:24,084
你还要不要回家了
Are you ever coming home?

306
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,054
玛丽  我在工作  行吗
Marie, I'm working. All right?

307
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:28,025
找到那辆房车了吗
Did you find it? The RV?

308
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:31,098
没  还在找
Nope. Working on it, so...

309
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,062
为什么不能直接逮捕他
Why can't you just arrest him,

310
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:34,085
逼他招呢
make him tell you?

311
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:37,016
宝贝儿  这事没那么简单
It's not that simple, baby.

312
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,089
有个东西叫宪法的
There's a little thing called The Constitution.

313
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,099
宪法...
The Constitution...

314
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:47,033
我对天发誓  我真想把这小崽子...
This kid, I swear to God, I wish I just could...

315
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:51,064
是那个叫平克曼的吗
This is that Pinkman character?

316
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:53,030
就是他
That's the one.

317
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,031
我能肯定那辆房车是他的
Positive the little bastard has got an RV,

318
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:57,084
只是不知道他藏在哪里
and I just don't know where he keeps it.

319
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,071
只能等他自己露出马脚
Until he actually leads me to where...

320
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:02,085
我陷在这儿了  玛丽
or does something, I'm stuck here, Marie,

321
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:05,058
对不起
so... sorry.

322
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:09,055
那...不是旧事重提
Well, um... not to bring up ancient history,

323
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,046
我只是想到一个人  他可能会了解
but I for one can think of someone who might know something...

324
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,083
一点情况
possibly.

325
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:18,033
值得一试
It's worth a shot.

326
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,057
是吗
Yeah?

327
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:23,027
谁
Who?

328
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:25,033
《草叶集》  沃尔特·惠特曼 著

329
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:28,034
喂
Hello.

330
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,007
喂  老兄  你好  最近怎么样
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey, how you doing?

331
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,028
汉克  什么事
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

332
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,064
我不想打扰你
Listen, I hate to bother you.

333
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,095
只是...只问你一个问题
I just... I just, uh... I just have a quick question.

334
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,058
说吧
Oh, shoot.

335
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:39,075
我现在实在是  走投无路了
Now, I'm only asking you this because I'm at a, you know,

336
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,065
所以才求救于你
dead-end here potentially.

337
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,096
我在查一个案子
I'm working a case, and, uh...

338
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:49,036
听我说  你要知道  我是最不愿意
Listen, you gotta know that I would never put you on the spot

339
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,086
让你尴尬为难的
or make you uncomfortable.

340
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,063
汉克  有话直说吧
Hank, you could just cut to the chase.

341
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:56,070
当年你失踪了
Back when we lost you

342
00:25:56,074 --> 00:25:58,047
我到处找你的时候
and I was trying to track you down

343
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,084
找到你以前的一个学生  杰西·平克曼
through a former student of yours, Jesse Pinkman,

344
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:03,088
向你交个底  我知道
now, you know that I know

345
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:06,048
当初你可能跟他买过大麻
that once upon a time he may have dealt you a little weed.

346
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,025
汉克
Hank...

347
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,042
一点点而已  我不介意
Just a little, and I so do not care about that.

348
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,085
据我所知  你从没吸过  好吧
As far as I'm concerned, you never inhaled, okay?

349
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,062
照你的意思  我们有话直说
Like you said, cut to the chase.

350
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:20,046
你记不记得平克曼这小子有辆房车
Do you remember if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?

351
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,043
就是休闲车
You know, a recreational vehicle,

352
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,077
温尼贝戈那种款式
you know, like a Winnebago-type deal,

353
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,077
棕黄条纹的
brown and beige?

354
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,094
问这干嘛
Uh, why?

355
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,077
这可说来话长
Well, it's a long story,

356
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:38,024
总之据我分析
but I'm personally of the opinion

357
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:39,031
他现在不贩大麻
that he's moved on from weed

358
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,086
直接卖晶体冰毒了
and graduated to selling crystal meth,

359
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:44,032
那房车就是他的移动实验室
using it as a rolling lab.

360
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,083
沃尔特
Walt?

361
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,010
唷
Yo.

362
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,077
说话呀  怀特老师
What? Mr. White.

363
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:35,013
喂  我的大天才忙什么呢
Hey, how's my favorite genius?

364
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,053
这电话安全吗
Is this a secure line?

365
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,050
这电话安全吗
Is this a secure...

366
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:39,076
自然  你怎么...
Yes, what's with the...

367
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,012
你也好啊
Hey, hello to you, too.

368
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:43,097
我们有麻烦了  毒管局找上门了
Listen, we've got a problem, a DEA problem.

369
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:47,087
我连襟  他知道房车的事了
My brother-in-law, he knows about the RV.

370
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,021
什么房车
What RV?

371
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,068
我们的房车
Our RV,

372
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:52,084
制冰毒的那个
the one which contains a meth lab,

373
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,011
里面到处都是我的指纹
which is covered with my fingerprints.

374
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:55,045
想起来没
Ring a bell?

375
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,035
想起来了  他知道多少
Okay, what exactly does "Knows about" Mean?

376
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,005
他找到车了吗  搜查了吗
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

377
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:01,079
没有  但他知道有这回事  他正在找
No, he knows it exists, and he's trying to find it.

378
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:03,002
他已经查到杰西了
He has linked it to Jesse,

379
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:05,010
找到房车只是时间问题
and it's only a matter of time before he tracks it down,

380
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,055
-所以  -所以赶紧把它处理掉
- So -So get rid of it.

381
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,043
你还不动手跟我说什么呢
What are you doing sitting here talking to me for?

382
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:10,021
最好就是  让平克曼去处理
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.

383
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,094
懂吗  你最好别沾边
Right? You don't go near it.

384
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,031
不  听我说  我连襟他
No, no, listen, my brother-in-law,

385
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:15,057
正在监视杰西的房子  你明白吗
he is surveying Jesse's house. Do you understand?

386
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:18,068
就是说他可能已经监听电话并装了窃听器
So he might've tapped the phones or bugged his house.

387
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,022
那就实施计划A
Plan A, then.

388
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:22,002
出发  在调查局之前找到那车
Go. Get to it before the Feds do.

389
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:25,035
具体怎么处理
And do what exactly?

390
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,052
怎么...
I mean, what...

391
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:31,046
怎么...把房车那么大个的东西
The thing... The thing is the size of a...

392
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,096
处理掉
it's RV size.

393
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,070
我哪有本事让房车消失
I mean, where do I go to make an RV disappear?

394
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,023
我又不是大卫·科波菲尔
I'm not David Copperfield.

395
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:40,024
你问我我问谁  我又不是处理房车的
What do I look like, the RV disposal people?

396
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:43,037
-你没计划过这种情况怎么处理  -没
- Did you not plan for this contingency? - No.

397
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,024
那你下次先计划好
Well, next time, plan for it, would you?

398
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:47,068
星舰进取号还有自毁键呢
The Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button.

399
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:50,045
-我的意思是  -够了  闭嘴
- I'm just saying. - Oh, Goss... shut up.

400
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,028
我的意思是  你看
I'm just saying, you know,

401
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,088
你摆弄工具这么在行
you're good with tools and all.

402
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:58,091
为什么不发明个水动力车呢
Why don't you invent a water-powered car, you know?

403
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:01,032
那样的话  就可以开着跑了
If you did that, you would be rolling in it.

404
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,099
套筒扳手递我
Socket wrench.

405
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,026
大号的
The big one.

406
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,038
怎么了
What?

407
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,010
你怕那些阿拉伯人
You scared of the Arabs?

408
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:20,011
你们疯啦  这车怎么能开出来
Are you out of your mind? Why is this out in the open?

409
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,038
你是谁啊
Who the hell are you?

410
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,051
他...他是海森堡
He's... He's Heisenberg.

411
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:23,065
能开吗  能开走吗
Is this drivable? Does it run?

412
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,095
能  我只是换个机油
Yeah, I was just changing the oil.

413
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,038
快换好
Well, finish it, quickly.

414
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,065
我们得把它擦干净开到沙漠里去
We'll wipe it clean and take it out to the desert.

415
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,095
过来帮忙
Come here and help me.

416
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,032
等等  为什么
Hold up. What's this about?

417
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,029
毒管局
The DEA,

418
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:35,089
毒品管制局
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

419
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:37,009
听说过吧
You've heard of them, haven't you?

420
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:38,016
我知道你听过
I know you have.

421
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,090
他们知道这辆房车的事了
They know all about this RV,

422
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,080
现在正在找它
and they're trying to find it right now.

423
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,013
我要它马上离开我的地盘
I want this off my property now.

424
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,074
不不不  我们得毁掉证据
No, no, no, no, no, we have got to destroy the evidence.

425
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,087
把它拆了烧掉  懂吗
We've got to rig this thing to burn. Do you understand?

426
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,084
不能在这  把这鬼东西弄走
Not here you don't. Just get it the hell out of here.

427
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:54,004
听我说  我需要你帮助
Now, listen to me. I need your help, okay?

428
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:55,091
要是我完了  我们全完蛋
If I go down, we all go down.

429
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:57,038
明白吗
Do you understand?

430
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:01,078
明白  我有更好的办法
All right, just... I know a better way.

431
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,081
我认识个人
I know a guy that'll wipe

432
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,084
能让它从此消失  不问来由
this off the planet, no questions asked.

433
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,008
打电话给他
Call him.

434
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:13,083
那杰西怎么办
Hey, what about Jesse?

435
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:15,009
凉拌
What about him?

436

00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:30,051
听我说
Now, listen to me.

439

搞到地址  猴子  不管用什么手段
You get that address. Now, Badger, I don't care how!

440
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:35,061
一定要知道他把车弄到哪儿去
You find out where he's taking it!

441
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,012
这就对了
Oh, yeah.

442
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:02,047
打扰一下  你们吃好了吗
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:19,028
先生们  打扰一下
Excuse me, gentlemen.

444

座位是给消费的客人准备的
This booth is for paying customers.

445
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:23,045
辛西娅  没有关系
Cynthia, it's okay.

00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,095
我来处理
I'll handle this.

447
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:31,087
有什么能效劳的吗

448
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,096
你心里清楚

449
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:41,010
等到日落

450
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:05,050
96  97  98  99  100
96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

451
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,022
要无法修复  明白吗
Beyond recovery, right?

452
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:09,030
-无法修复就是...  -我知道
- Now, beyond recovery means... - I get it.

453
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,094
无法修复
Beyond recovery.

454
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,067
-完全消失  没有证据  -别担心
- Obliterated, no evidence. - Hey, don't worry.

455
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,047
我们处理过之后
When we're through with it,

456
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,076
整个车就这么大一块了  怎样
it's going to be about yea big, okay?

457
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:18,068
然后用平板车运到长滩上
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,

458
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,068
再船运到太平洋对岸
ship it across the Pacific.

459
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,022
中国人会用它来做庭院里的家具
Chinese turn it into patio furniture,

460
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,069
你就放心吧
so... mind at ease.

461
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:28,029
你能再帮我个忙吗
Listen, can you do me a favor?

462
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:30,036
车没了我不太方便
I'm obviously going to need a ride.

463
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,049
能帮我叫辆车吗
Could you call a cab?

464
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,053
没问题  合作愉快
You got it. Pleasure doing business.

465
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:35,013
谢谢  我马上就来
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.

466
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,037
我只是...
I just need to...

467
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,081
-你在这里干什么  -你问我
- The hell you think you're doing? - Me?

468
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:19,071
它对我们两个来说都很重要
No, this is mine just as much as yours!

469
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,068
-你休想...  -糟了
- You don't get to just--  - Oh, God. Oh, God.

470
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,008
又怎么了
What?

471
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:27,068
他们来了
God, they're out--

472
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,007
怎么回事
What?

473
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,065
他在这里
He's here.

474
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,046
你说谁
Who's here?

475
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:41,013
别这样
Oh, no.

476
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,010
完了  这下完了
Oh, God. Oh, God.

477
00:33:48,014 --> 00:33:49,057
是你引他过来的
You led him right to us.

478
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,040
该死
Shit.

479
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:16,049
平克曼先生  你还想加条拒捕的罪名吗
Mr. Pinkman, you want to add resisting arrest?

480
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:18,090
你没意见我一定照做  我可不在乎
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

481
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,027
给你最后一次主动认罪的机会
Last chance to do it the easy way.

482
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:05,001
有搜查令吗
Got a warrant?

483
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,091
你是谁
Who are you?

484
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:09,048
你是谁啊  知道这辆房车的事吗
Who are you? What do you know about this RV?

485
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:11,088
我是这个场子的主人
Well, I'm the owner of this lot,

486
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:15,045
也就是说  你正非法入侵私人财产
which means you're trespassing on private property.

487
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,049
说到那辆旅行房车  我看它是被锁上了
As far as the RV goes, seems to me it's locked,

488
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,012
你却想破门而入
which means you're trying to break and enter,

489
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:23,033
所以我再问一遍  你是有搜查令还是怎么的
so I say again, you got a warrant?

490
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:27,006
如果我惹了麻烦  那才需要搜查令
Well, I don't need one if I've got probable cause,

491
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,008
"问题"先生
counselor.

492
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:31,026
无论车子停着或在干嘛
Probable cause usually relates to vehicles,

493
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,050
都很容易受损
is my understanding, you know,

494
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,061
这是我的理解  所以它才在这里
traffic stops and whatnot.

495
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:37,041
看到这些圆形塑胶的东西吗
See these round rubber things?

496
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,034
轮胎
Wheels.

497
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,074
这是一辆车
This is a vehicle.

498
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,016
这是一处住宅  一个居所
This is a domicile, a residence,

499
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,043
根据第四修正法案
and thus protected by the Fourth Amendment

500
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:49,064
可以拒绝非法搜查
from unlawful search and seizure.

501
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:51,027
朋友  你何不离开一下...
Look buddy, why don't you just go out and--

502
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,038
你有看到它开进这里吗
Did you see this drive in here?

503
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,068
你怎么知道它没坏
How do you know it runs?

504
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:57,075
你亲眼看到什么失德行为吗
Did you actually witness any wrongdoing?

505
00:36:57,078 --> 00:37:00,003
在我看来  你出现在这里是为了...
It seems to me you're just out here...

506
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:05,075
就是到法庭上也没人会赞同这种行为
Don't see that holding up in a court of law.

507
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:11,003
是嘛
Oh, yeah?

508
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,043
过来看看
Well, look at these.

509
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,033
你觉得这像什么
What do those look like to you?

510
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:20,030
我觉得像是子弹干的
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

511
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:24,097
这个"住宅"曾经发生过交火事件
There was a firearm discharged inside of this "Domicile."

512
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,081
要打赌有几个法官会认为
Willing to bet there's a judge or two out there

513
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:28,094
这是意外  听好了
who'd see that as probable cause, but I'll tell you what.

514
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,078
你应该向阿尔伯克基市警方报案...
Why don't you call the Albuquerque police--

515
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,002
在你撕开胶布前
How could you have known that they were there

516
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:36,012
你怎么知道那里有弹孔
before you took off the tape?

517
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:37,052
你说什么
What?

518
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,009
在你撕开胶布前
How could you have known that they were there

519
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:42,014
你怎么知道那里有弹孔
before you took off the tape?

520
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:45,039
就这么说
Say it. Say it.

521
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,040
在你撕开胶布前
How could you have known that

522
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,023
你怎么知道那里有弹孔
they were there before you took off the tape?

523
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:52,053
里面说的没错
That's right.

524
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:56,020
显而易见  这种情况有很多种可能
Probable cause needs to be readily apparent.

525
00:37:57,097 --> 00:38:00,007
里面有人
There's somebody in there.

526
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,037
...这里是私人住宅  我不想被骚扰
...private domicile and I won't be harassed.

527
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,064
听好了  平克曼
Yeah, I'll tell you what, Pinkman.

528
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:05,064
管它是不是意外  我给你三秒钟时间
Probable cause or no, I'll give you three seconds

529
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:07,078
滚出来
to get your ass out here.

530
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,058
1  2...
1, 2--

531
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:13,062
这里是我的私人住宅  别骚扰我
This is my own private domicile, and I will not be harassed.

532
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:15,055
衰人
Bitch.

533
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:27,060
你要搜查令嘛  简单
Fine. You want your warrant?

534
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:31,029
我会让弟兄们送来
I'll have my guys bring it out here

535
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:33,020
连同牢房一起送给你
and deliver it to you on a little satin pillow.

536
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:34,041
怎么样
How's that?

537
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:39,034
我已经等了很久了  再等会也无妨
I waited this long. Wait a little longer.

538
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,069
维姬
Hey, Vicky.

539
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:01,073
对  施拉德
Yeah, Schrader.

540
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,013
我找Merkert  谢谢
Give me Merkert, will you?

541
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:16,088
我想...
You know, I say--

542
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:20,028
直接撞他  怎么样
I say we just ram him. All right?

543
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,049
我们...
I mean, we, uh--

544
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:24,099
发动车子
we-- we start her up

545
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:27,039
直接撞烂他的破车
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

546
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:29,053
我们就能逃跑了
We make our escape. Right?

547
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,010
当然了  他会...
Yeah, he'd, uh--

548
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,047
他会一枪崩了我
he'd shoot me in the head.

549
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,074
他会崩了我
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

550
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:47,014
我们该怎么办
So what do we do, man, huh?

551
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,038
我们...
What do we--

552
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,058
你想到什么了
What?

553
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:55,092
你是不是有办法了
Please tell me you got something.

554
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:03,013
对  是有个点子
Yeah, I got something.

555
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:17,091
是我
It's me.

556
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:19,068
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

557
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,050
是亨利·R·施拉德先生吗
Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?

558
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:48,021
对  你是哪位
Yeah. Who's this?

559
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:51,078
我是阿尔伯克基市警署的伊莲·坦纳警官
Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner with the Albuquerque Police.

560
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,051
玛丽·施拉德是你的妻子吗
Is your wife Marie Schrader?

561
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:55,085
是的  怎么了
Yes, why?

562
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:57,017
我很遗憾地通知你
I'm sorry to inform you that

563
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:59,015
你妻子发生了汽车事故
your wife's been in an automobile accident.

564
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:01,079
她正被送往Los Ranchos医疗中心
She's being airlifted to Los Ranchos Medical Center

565
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:06,006
即将抵达
and should be arriving there shortly.

566
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,083
她怎么样  情况如何
How is she? What's her condition?

567
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:09,073
我并不是...
I don't, um...

568
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:11,070
我不知道她的最新情况
have the most current information, sir,

569
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:14,013
希望你尽快前往那里
but I think you might want to get there as soon as possible.

570
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,087
你得给我加钱了
You're going to have to start paying me more.

571
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,006
-玛丽  -我刚到家
- Marie? - I'm just checking in.

572
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:19,031
我打来问问
I'd love to have some idea

573
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:21,034
要不要我准备晚餐
of whether I should cook dinner or not.

574
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,086
你没事吧
Are you okay?

575
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,057
我很好  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

576
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:33,047
汉克  发生什么了
Hank? What's up?

577
00:44:58,053 --> 00:45:00,023
我早就告诉过你们

578
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:03,073
你们不能杀沃尔特·怀特

579
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:07,098
除非我跟他的交易结束了

580
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,063
我们等很久了

581
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:13,023
失去耐性了

582
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:16,073
你们不得不继续等着

583
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,053
这是命令

584
00:45:19,003 --> 00:45:20,093
由不得你们

585
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:28,083
告诉我  为什么急着要杀怀特

586
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:35,033
他确实背叛了你们的堂兄屠库

587
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:39,053
但他不是杀人凶手

588
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,059
扣动扳机的

589
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:45,023
会不会另有其人

590
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:47,088
毒管局的探员

591
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:51,003
波尔沙说毒管局是禁区

592
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:55,033
北部边境是我的领地

593
00:45:55,073 --> 00:45:57,041
那是我说的

594
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:01,072
而出于对波尔沙的尊敬...

595
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:04,008
这次我同意对毒管局动手

596
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:17,026
那位探员名叫

597
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,033
汉克·施拉德

598
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:26,073
希望他的死能慰藉你们
