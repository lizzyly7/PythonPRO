1
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
绝

2
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
命

3
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
毒

4
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
师

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
第三季

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:46,000
第十集

7
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:04,075
他居然没要求我们打卡  真令人惊讶
Surprised he doesn't make us do that.

8
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:10,052
狼群有严格的等级
The pack totally has a pecking order.

9
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:14,056
土狼头领  就是老大
And the head Hyena, he's the man.

10
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,099
其它土狼都得  舔它的屁股
All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass.

11
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,053
不是夸张  是真的  太恶心了
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

12
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:23,000
它们都得去舔
They have to lick his jerk.

13
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:26,034
电视上竟然还演这个  我都没法相信
I-I-I can't believe they even showed it on TV.

14
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:34,060
要是咱们这真想搞成职业联盟那样的
Yo, if this is supposed to be all, like, Major League and all,

15
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:38,014
就该有专人来维护设备
we should have equipment maintainer guys.

16
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:45,051
还得有送水的  知道吗
And water boys. You know?

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,078
贱人  来瓶佳得乐
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

18
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,021
再找两个狗腿子
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

19
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,075
把咱们服侍好
Treat us right.

20
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:08,033
好了  定时为15个小时
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

21
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:11,099
你没意见的话我就开工了
I'm going to hit it, if that's cool with you.

22
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:14,001
我不明白
I don't understand.

23
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,034
明白什么
What?

24
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,021
这些数字  怎么算都对不上
These numbers, they just don't add up.

25
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,091
早跟你说了  那家伙压榨我们
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

26
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:22,078
不  不是那事
No, it's not that.

27
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:24,041
是我们的产量  少了
It's our output. We're off.

28
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:27,082
少了百分之0.14
We're 0.14% off.

29
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:33,062
百分之0.14...  到底什么意思
Point one-four, that's what, like... What does that mean?

30
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:37,046
意思是我们的产量少于应有的
It means we should be netting more than we're netting.

31
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,059
少了多少
So how far off are we?

32
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,029
少到不能忽略不计了
It's not negligible.

33
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,070
粗略算了下  大概少了0.25到0.5磅
Ball-parking it, I'd say we're quarter to a half a pound shy.

34
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,087
真奇怪
That's weird.

35
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,047
溢出量算了吗
What about spillage?

36
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,081
溢出量
Spillage?

37
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:02,004
就是  不小心溅出来那些
Yeah, you know, like, just stuff gets spilled.

38
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,093
没溅出过任何东西
Nothing gets spilled.

39
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,064
或许有一点点呢
A little maybe.

40
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,041
没溅出过任何东西
Nothing gets spilled.

41
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,092
那蒸发了呢
What about evaporation?

42
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:12,028
蒸发量不会有这么大
It wouldn't account for this much.

43
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,052
原料暴露时间又没那么长
The materials aren't out that long.

44
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:19,039
那么  水滴呢  就像...
What about the other one? The drops, like on...

45
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:21,063
冰啤酒瓶上的那种
on that, like, cold beer.

46
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,096
冷凝吗
Condensation?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,020
对
Yeah.

48
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,083
不可能
No.

49
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,066
会不会是剩下的那些渣滓
What about the crap that gets left behind,

50
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,044
就是  我们从桶里抠出来的粘糊糊的东西
you know, all the gunk we scrape out of the vats?

51
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,094
我算了  每个桶差不多有一加仑
I add up, like, a gallon each.

52
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:39,054
你算进去了吗
Did you work that in?

53
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,044
残留
Vestiges?

54
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,034
对  残留
Yeah. Vestiges.

55
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,015
肯定是这个
Bet that's it.

56
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,058
肯定就是这个了
Bet that's totally it.

57
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,092
怀特老师
Hey, Mr. White.

58
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,002
-怀特老师  -说
- Mr. White. - Huh?

59
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,043
你还好吧
Are you okay?

60
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,030
很好  怎么了
Yeah... Yeah, why?

61
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,087
没事
Nothing.

62
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:23,024
你不走吗
Are you coming?

63
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,021
好  马上
Yeah, in a minute.

64
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,045
好吧  明天见
All right, see you tomorrow.

65
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,037
该死
Shit.

66
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,060
你个杂种
You bastard.

67
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:56,068
狗娘养...
Son of a...

68
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,006
来呀
Come on, you...

69
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,083
来呀  来呀
Come on, come on.

70
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,010
狗娘养...
Son of a...

71
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,031
好
Okay.

72
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,019
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

73
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,044
太好了
That's great.

74
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,051
小杂种
You little bastard.

75
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,051
关上门
Shut the door!

76
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,007
我耳朵要炸了
My ears are popping.

77
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,041
关上门  快
Shut the door. Move.

78
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,054
这感觉像在飞机似的
It's like I'm on an airplane, yo.

79
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:52,061
什么鬼东西搞的
What the hell's doing that?

80
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,071
正压力
Positive pressure.

81
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,052
正什么
Positive what?

82
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,066
老天  真要人命
God, friggin' kills, yo.

83
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,062
动动下巴  来回活动
Well, just move your jaw around. Move it around.

84
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,026
我动着呢  不管用
I am moving it around. It's not working.

85
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,088
那就打个呵欠什么的  别大惊小怪
Then just yawn or something. Stop acting like such a baby.

86
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,030
该死
Damn.

87
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,080
那什么正  正什么
W-W-What positive? Positive what?

88
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,077
压力  我调高了通风设备的阀值
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up

89
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,030
使这里与外界产生压力差
to keep the outside out.

90
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,067
这里出现了"污染物"
There's been a contamination.

91
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:21,034
等下  什么
Wait. What?

92
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,051
喂  等一下
Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up.

93
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,085
实验室里进了东西
Something got into the lab.

94
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:28,048
我们怎么办
So what do we do?

95
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,082
我是说  我们
I mean, do we...

96
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:33,029
等等  等等  我们不该戴面罩吗
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't we be wearing masks?

97
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:36,056
不不  不是...那种"污染物"
No, no, it's not that... that kind of contaminant.

98
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,040
那是什么  不危险吗
So it's, like, not dangerous?

99
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:43,007
怀特老师  我跟你说话呢
Mr. White, talk to me here.

100
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,030
对我们无害
Not to us particularly. No.

101
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:49,044
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell is that?

102
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:54,008
这个...  是我做的
This is, uh... I made it.

103
00:11:55,043 --> 00:12:00,005
那这啥"污染物"到底是什么
So exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here?

104
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,047
一只苍蝇
A fly.

105
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,098
什么意思
What do you mean?

106
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:13,034
一只...  什么苍蝇
A fly, like... like what do you mean?

107
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:16,041
我说的就是苍蝇  家蝇
I mean a fly, a house fly.

108
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,075
就是  一只苍蝇
Like, uh, one fly?

109
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,055
就一只  它干了什么
Singular? What did it do?

110
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,089
它飞进了实验室  我要打死它
It got into the lab, and I'm trying to get it out.

111
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,059
行了吗  懂不懂
Okay? Understand?

112
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,096
没懂  哥们
No, man, not really.

113
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:36,016
我想我还是没跟上你思路
I can't say that I'm really following you here.

114
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,011
伙计  你把我魂都吓飞了
Dude, you scared the shit out of me.

115
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,030
你说污染物的时候
I mean, when you say it's contamination,

116
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,096
我还以为是  埃博拉病毒什么的呢
I mean, I'm thinking, like an Ebola leak or something.

117
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,009
埃博拉病毒
Ebola?

118
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,077
对  探索频道播的一种病
Yeah, it's a disease on The Discovery Channel,

119
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:50,081
能让你把肠子都拉出来
where all your intestines sort of just slip right out of your butt.

120
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:53,027
谢谢  我知道埃博拉病毒是什么
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.

121
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:55,098
你倒说说看  西非病毒怎么会
Now, tell me. What would a West-African virus

122
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,054
跑到我们实验室里
be doing in our lab?

123
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,092
你自己满屋撵苍蝇
So you're chasing around a fly,

124
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:05,092
还说我是白痴
and in your world I'm the idiot.

125
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,062
杰西  听着
Jesse, listen.

126
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,026
这只苍蝇...  任何苍蝇
This fly... any fly...

127
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,083
都不可以出现在我们实验室
cannot be in our lab.

128
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,029
它是个问题
It's... It's a problem.

129
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,076
它是污染物
It's a contamination,

130
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,009
我绝对没有用错词
and that is in no way a misuse of the word.

131
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:20,023
懂了吗
Okay?

132
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,087
为保证我们制毒环境的清洁
So in terms of keeping our cook clean

133
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,013
和产品的纯正
and our product unadulterated,

134
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,070
我们必须严肃对待
we need to take this very seriously.

135
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,024
现在懂了吗
Now do you understand?

136
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,047
那这个就是你的砍蝇刀了
So is that your fly saber?

137
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,068
这是苍蝇拍
This is a swatter.

138
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,095
而且非常好用  谢谢
It happens to work quite well, thank you.

139
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:45,095
你的头怎么了
Uh-huh. Hey, what happened to your head?

140
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,076
没怎么  我很好
Nothing. I'm fine.

141
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,013
不是撞的吗  而且撞得很严重
You didn't hit it, like really... really hard?

142
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,092
我的头不是问题  杰西
My head is not the problem, Jesse.

143
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:55,013
苍蝇才是
The fly is the problem.

144
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:03,023
你不会是...试了我们的产品吧
You didn't happen to maybe... try our product, did you?

145
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:07,077
杰西  我知道对你这样的门外汉来说
Jess I know this seems unusual to you, a layman.

146
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,057
一只苍蝇...是无关紧要的  对吗
A fly... I get it... seems insignificant, right?

147
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,090
但是相信我
But trust me.

148
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:14,037
在实验室这种高度受控环境中
In a highly controlled environment such as this...

149
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,091
任何污染物
...any pollutant..

150
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:24,058
不管多么微小
...no matter how small...

151
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,019
都有可能彻底...
...could completely...

152
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,080
喂
Hello.

153
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,064
干嘛
What?

154
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:55,014
你整晚都在这吗
Were you here all night?

155
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,091
你睡过觉了吗
Have you even slept?

156
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,095
没  杰西  听着  我没事
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine. Okay

157
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,005
你能不能专心...
Will you just please focus...

158
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,002
好了  我们已经晚点了  赶紧开工
Okay, look. We're running late, so let's just get started.

159
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:12,056
好不好  早死早超生
Shall we? The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done.

160
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,066
他妈的  终于正常了
Frickin' finally.

161
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,004
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

162
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:24,034
该加碱了
It's time to alkaline.

163
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:27,031
我说的你没听进去
Have you not heard a word I said?

164
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:30,071
没把这苍蝇搞死前  不制毒
No cooking until this fly is dealt with.

165
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:33,045
你当我刚才自言自语吗
Have I been speaking to myself?

166
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,092
喂  时间可不多了
The timer went off, yo.

167
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:38,075
你觉得这批货多久才能好  一两小时吗
How long is this batch going to be good for? An hour? Two?

168
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,022
除非清掉污染物  否则这批货是不会好的
The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant.

169
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,019
清掉污染物
Clear the contaminant?

170
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:47,003
我们制的是冰毒
We're making meth here,

171
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,046
又不是航天飞机
not space shuttles.

172
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,073
逮住那苍蝇之前  什么也不制
We're making nothing until we catch this fly.

173
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,000
什么苍蝇嘛
What fly?

174
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:56,020
这他妈哪有什么苍蝇嘛
Where the hell is this fly?

175
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,070
我看都没看见
Not like I've even seen the thing.

176
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:00,050
说不定你那啥正压力把它吹出门去了呢
Maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something.

177
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:04,007
不会的  它就在这附近  明白吗
No, no. It is here. It is around. Okay?

178
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,055
就在这  我不会允许这批货暴露在外
He's around, and am not going to expose this batch

179
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,080
被污染物影响  完毕
to the open air and contamination. Period.

180
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,072
你可以选择现在出去  让我自己搞定
Now, you can leave me to deal with this myself,

181
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,067
或者来帮我
or you can help me,

182
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,062
不过你说对了
but you are right.

183
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:16,009
我们的确快没时间了
We are running out of time,

184
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:17,092
请你现在就回答我
so I need your answer right now.

185
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,096
好吧
Okay.

186
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:40,080
你这是在浪费时间
Hey, tick-tock. Yo.

187
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:51,045
虽然我的确喜欢制纯正货  但现实点
Look, I like making cherry products, but let's keep it real.

188
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:55,095
瘾君子根本不在乎是否纯正
All right, we make poison for people who don't care.

189
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,085
他们可能是世上最不挑剔的顾客
We probably have the most unpicky customers in the world.

190
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:01,049
不  你少找借口
No, no, no, no, no. No rationalizing.

191
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,099
它随时可能出现  别放弃
We'll find it any minute now. Don't give up.

192
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,054
你知不知道...
Did you--

193
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:22,057
糖果制造的生产标准里有一条
Did you know that there's an acceptable level of rat turds

194
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:26,048
即可接受的老鼠粪便的程度
that can go into candy bars?

195
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:29,048
还是政府出台的  老兄
That's the government, Jack.

196
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:35,005
政府都不怎么关心产品质量
Even the government doesn't care that much about quality.

197
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:42,049
你知道热狗里都放些什么吗
You know what is okay to put in hotdogs? Huh?

198
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:46,000
猪唇跟猪屁眼
Pig lips and assholes,

199
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,043
要我说  混蛋  随便放
but I say, hey, have at it, bitchs,

200
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,094
老子就喜欢吃热狗
because I love hotdogs,

201
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:55,064
你看  我...
and, you know, see what I'm--

202
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,091
你在干什么
What are you doing?

203
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:58,088
没什么
Oh. Hey.

204
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,061
让我先把活干完
Look, let me just top it off,

205
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,032
很快就好  行不行
all right, really quick.

206
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,065
加点氢氧化钠[碱]  盖上盖子
A little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid,

207
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,025
没有污染  就完事了
no harm done. Then we're golden.

208
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:17,053
别动它  这是命令
It stays closed. That's an order.

209
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,089
你命令个屁  希特勒
You can't order shit, Adolf.

210
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:23,060
我们是平等的合伙人  还记得不
We're 50-50 partners. Remember?

211
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,011
天  你到底哪根筋不对
God, what is your problem, bro?

212
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,068
你他妈神经病
Freakin' psycho.

213
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,041
杰西
Jesse.

214
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:42,022
上帝  好像伤到骨头了
Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.

215
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,058
杰西
Jesse.

216
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:45,035
杰西
Jesse.

217
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,016
看到没有
You see it, right?

218
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,002
看到没
You see it?

219
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,033
看到了
Yeah.

220
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,003
干掉它
Get it.

221
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,040
你想让我去打它
You want me to get it?

222
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,017
没错
Yes.

223
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:10,054
等等  悠着点
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow.

224
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,061
缓慢移动
Move slowly.

225
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,081
我知道
I know.

226
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,081
我正缓慢移动
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

227
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:19,001
没错  苍蝇拍给我
Absolutely. I'm just going to need your swatter thing.

228
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:25,029
好的  给我
Yeah. Come on.

229
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:28,002
就这样  给我
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

230
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,053
拜托  稳住了
Come on. Make it count.

231
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,073
好  不不  我要...
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna--

232
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:36,050
我手头有准儿  放心
I'm going to make it count, all right.

233
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:39,000
好的  现在
Ok. Now.

234
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,053
我数到三
On three.

235
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:42,013
好的
Okay.

236
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:43,044
一
One--

237
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,030
爽了吗
Yeah. You like that?

238
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,071
疼吧
Hurts, huh?

239
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,092
你打到它没
Did you get it?

240
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:57,056
-我想是的  -它在哪里
- I think so, yeah. - Where is it?

241
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:59,056
我不知道  那无关紧要
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

242
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,056
谁在乎  我干掉它了
Who cares? I got it.

243
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,023
上帝  开什么玩笑吗
Oh, Jesus, seriously?

244
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:05,066
它在哪里
Where is it?

245
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,023
就在那里  看那里
It's, uh, right there. Look.

246
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:12,067
看到没  我就说我成功了
Look. See? I told you I got it.

247
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,088
这是葡萄干
This is a raisin.

248
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,059
我肯定打到它了
Look, I definitely got it, man.

249
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:29,019
好吧...
All right--

250
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:33,013
伙计
Oh, man.

251
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,046
它还挺厉害
He's got some skills, yo.

252
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,053
你把它练出来了
you give him that.

253
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:41,060
听着
Look...

254
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:46,001
尽管我觉得你不会明白
I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you,

255
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:49,064
但我还想再说明一次
but once more I shall try.

256
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:53,065
这只苍蝇是当前头等大事
This fly is a major problem for us.

257
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:56,032
它会毁掉整批货物
It will ruin our batch.

258
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,036
只有灭了它
Now, we need to destroy it

259
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,049
把它留下的痕迹弄干净  才能继续制毒
and every trace of it so we can cook.

260
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,036
要是失败了...
Failing that...

261
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,083
我们就完蛋了
we're dead.

262
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,091
我们不能出差错
There is no more room for error.

263
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,061
这帮人是容不得差错的
Not with these people.

264
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,045
出去透透气怎么样
All right, how about we go get some air?

265
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:27,039
出去透透气
Get some air?

266
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:31,029
这就是你对"我们问题大条了"的反应吗
Your answer to "We're sliding head-first into a massive crap--"

267
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,099
怀特老师
Mister-- Mr. White,

268
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:36,033
我明白那只苍蝇的重要性
I understand that the fly is a serious thing.

269
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,083
我是完全赞同你的
Now, all right? I'm on board.

270
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:41,020
我是说  出去透透气
I'm just saying maybe if we went and got some air,

271
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:44,074
或许能想到办法抓住它
it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.

272
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,037
然后再回来
Then come back down here

273
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,057
干掉它
and subtract his ass.

274
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,055
等等  你带钥匙了吗
Oh, wait, do you have your keys?

275
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:13,011
-带了  -你确定吗
- Yeah. - You're sure?

276
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:15,005
要被锁外面就惨了
Last thing we need is to get locked out.

277
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,035
带了
Yeah.

278
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:21,006
如果你不肯帮我  就滚远点
If you're not going to help me, stay out of my way!

279
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:31,053
有人有斧头吗
Yo. Yo, does somebody have an ax I can use?

280
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,007
斧头之类的
El ax-o!

281
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,077
危险的斧头
Peligroso! El ax-o!

282
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,044
主断电器  危险  440伏特电压

283
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,052
终于找到你了
There we go.

284
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:14,090
晚安吧
Say good night.

285
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:18,080
我操
Son of a bitch!

286
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,054
操
Son of a...

287
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:29,011
妈的  见鬼
Shit! Damn it!

288
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,008
他妈的怎么回事...
Where in the hell is that...

289
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:51,093
怎么回事
What the hell?

290
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,087
要来杯饮料吗
Need some juice maybe?

291
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,070
不客气
Knock yourself out.

292
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:09,029
这才是真的  你那个不管用
It's a real one. Yeah, like yours was working.

293
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,025
不  不
No, no...

294
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,009
没用  听着  我们是要净化实验室
No, no-- Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

295
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:17,099
越弄越脏可不是净化
You don't decontaminate by contaminating further.

296
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,046
这都是些什么破玩意儿
What the hell is all this?

297
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:24,070
这个怎么样
Here, how about this?

298
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,060
无毒胶水带
"Nontoxic glue strips."

299
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,064
它能散发信息素
Yeah, baby, it's got pheromones, all right.

300
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,080
我买了很多  可以把这地方挂满
I got a buttload. We hang them up all over the place.

301
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,067
它插翅难飞
It won't be able to resist.

302
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,061
希望贴的够多
I sure hope we have enough.

303
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:45,032
我敢打包票  绝对够多了
I'm going to go out on a limb and say yeah.

304
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,049
你看到它没
Do you see him?

305
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:53,029
你有多久没睡觉了
How long do you think you've been awake?

306
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,033
干嘛一直问我这个
Why do you keep asking me that?

307
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,016
我寻思着你可以喝点咖啡
Just figure you could use some coffee, is all.

308
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,013
我得来点
I know I could.

309
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:02,023
怎么样
How about it?

310
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,027
好的
Yeah.

311
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:09,041
要牛奶和方糖吗
You take cream and sugar?

312
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,061
清咖啡就好
Black is fine.

313
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:26,029
随它去吧
Why don't you just leave him be?

314
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:28,069
让它自投罗网
Let the traps do the work.

315
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:32,033
信息素会管用的
These pheromones are supposed to kick ass.

316
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,087
随时都可能逮住这小杂种
I bet we catch this mo-fo any second.

317
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,058
谢谢
Thank you.

318
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:59,019
你有没有在家中与野生动物纠缠的经历
You ever have, like, a wild animal trapped in your house?

319
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,016
印象中没有
Not that I can recall, no.

320
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,050
我遇到过一次
We did, this one time,

321
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:11,037
在我姨妈家的时候
back when it was my aunt's house,

322
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,067
在她死于癌症之前
back before she died of cancer.

323
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:20,047
负鼠  又大又丑
Possum. Big, freaky-looking bitch.

324
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:21,092
从什么时候起
Hey, since when did they

325
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:24,051
它们更名为袋鼫  原名有什么问题
change it to "Opossum"? What's up with that?

326
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,088
在我小时候
I mean, when I was coming up,

327
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:27,088
它就叫负鼠
it was just "Possum."

328
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:31,076
袋鼫听起来像是爱尔兰那边的
"Opossum" makes it sound like he's Irish or something.

329
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,003
为什么把一切改来改去的
Why they gotta go changing everything?

330
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:37,093
不管怎样  只是肥老鼠罢了
Whatever. They're just big rats anyways,

331
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:41,096
长着粉红色尾巴和脸的老鼠
giant pink-tailed rats with their pink rat faces,

332
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,083
丑的要死
totally freaky,

333
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,013
像外星鼠
like alien rats.

334
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:52,007
实际上  它不是困在房子里
Actually, it's not so much that he got trapped,

335
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:56,045
它就住在房子底下
but he was living there, you know, under the house.

336
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:59,082
你能听到它到各房间串门
You could hear him going from, like, room to room,

337
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:03,005
跑的飞快
always scurrying around.

338
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,022
有时晚上还能看到它们出来
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night,

339
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:08,049
它就假装一动不动
and he would just, you know, freeze.

340
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:12,003
好像这样你就看不到它了
And it's like you're not looking right at it. Right?

341
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,000
它感觉自己能愚弄你
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

342
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:18,073
它们就这点花招  喜欢装死
That's what they do, honestly. They play dead or whatever.

343
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:21,040
太傻了
It's just so lame.

344
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,062
这故事有重点吗
Is there a discernible point to this story,

345
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:32,071
或是你在不久的将来才表达的出来的重点
a point that you'll be arriving at sometime in the near future?

346
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:36,065
就是让我记忆深刻  忘不掉
It was just a total bitch to get out. It took forever.

347
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:41,025
叫了个人来  布置好陷阱
A guy came, set all these traps and all,

348
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:43,042
最后抓到了它
and he finally got it,

349
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:48,096
但我姨妈根本不信
but my aunt, she didn't believe it.

350
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,030
她坚持说还能听到它跑动的声音
She kept insisting she could still hear the thing.

351
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:56,050
抓没抓到根本没区别
I mean, you could not tell her any different.

352
00:27:56,054 --> 00:28:00,094
她开始在椅子边上放了把旧伞
She started keeping an old umbrella by her chair.

353
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:04,001
她开始戳地板  冲它喊话
Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it,

354
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:06,075
还给它起了个名字
even gave it a name.

355
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,085
好像是...
It was, uh, Sc--

356
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,075
斯克莱博
Scrabble.

357
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:12,015
没错  就这么叫的
Yeah, that was it.

358
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:14,099
斯克莱博  别吵了  咚咚咚
"Scrabble, just knock it off." Bang, bang, bang.

359
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:21,063
直到去世  她一直这样
She got like that toward the end.

360
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:26,020
像入了迷似的
Got obsessive about stuff,

361
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:30,024
简直走火入魔了
just got mad about stuff.

362
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:33,014
我们不知道是怎么回事
We didn't know what was up.

363
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:36,074
根本不像她的处事作风
It wasn't like her to be that way.

364
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,015
结果是...
But it turned out that the--

365
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:46,055
她的癌细胞扩散到了脑部
the cancer had spread to her brain,

366
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,059
这才是原因
and that was why.

367
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,042
病灶转移了
It metastasized.

368
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,046
但幸好
But it was good that that

369
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:59,040
我们当时决定带她去看医生
was when we decided to take her to the doctor

370
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:03,002
然后了解到了她的情况
because then we knew what was up

371
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:07,031
并且让她接受了治疗
and got her some treatment

372
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:09,094
服了些药  让她不至于整天神经兮兮的
and meds so she wasn't stressing all the time.

373
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:18,048
之后她就好多了
It was a lot better after that.

374
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:21,019
她自己也开心多了
She was a lot happier.

375
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,006
那只该死的苍蝇跑哪儿去了
Where the hell is he?

376
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:45,018
我上礼拜才和我的肿瘤医生见了面
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse, just last week.

377
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,035
我的病情依然在缓解
I'm still in remission.

378
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:53,068
很健康
I'm healthy.

379
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:57,075
那很好
Okay, so good. Great.

380
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:04,013
是啊  没完没了的
Well, no end in sight.

381
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,057
也很好啊
That's great.

382
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,010
我找不着那苍蝇了
Well, I missed it.

383
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:24,068
曾经有些完美的时刻
There was some perfect moment,

384
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,068
都与我擦肩而过
and it passed me right by.

385
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:33,096
我当时得留下足够的钱给他们
Yeah, I had to have enough to leave them.

386
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:37,003
这才是最重要的
That was the whole point.

387
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:43,077
如果我当时没钱的话  这一切无意义了
None of this makes any sense if I didn't have enough.

388
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,067
但那得是在斯凯勒发现之前
But it had to be before she found out... Skyler.

389
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,098
一定得在那之前
It had to be before that.

390
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:56,035
那个完美的时刻
Perfect moment...

391
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,025
什么的时刻
For what?

392
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:01,025
死亡时刻吗
To drop dead?

393
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,002
你是说你想死吗
What, are you saying you want to die?

394
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:11,030
我是说我活得太长了
I'm saying I've lived too long.

395
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:18,020
我想让他们想念我
You want them to actually miss you.

396
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:20,064
你明白吗
You know?

397
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,007
想让他们对我的回忆
You want their memories of you

398
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,094
就好像...
to be--

399
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:31,022
但她就是不...
But she just won't

400
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:33,022
她就是不明白
She just won't understand.

401
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:38,016
不管我的解释有多么合情合理
No matter how well I explain it,

402
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,030
那段时间她就是...
these days she just has this--

403
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,000
就是...
this--

404
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:49,051
我真的觉得  有那么一些话...
I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words.

405
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,071
肯定有...
There must exist

406
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,088
那么些话
certain words

407
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:57,092
特殊而又明确的话  来解释这一切
in a certain, specific order that would explain all of this,

408
00:31:57,095 --> 00:32:04,086
但在她面前  我就怎么也想不出来
but with her I just-- I just can't ever seem to find them.

409
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,033
怀特老师  要不您先坐会儿
Mr. White, how about you just sit down?

410
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:10,033
我觉得是在我那次神游之前...
I was thinking maybe before the fugue state,

411
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:12,050
但在那之前
but before the fugue state

412
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,087
我的钱还没有凑够
they didn't have enough money,

413
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,034
所以不是那时候
so no, not then.

414
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:30,022
而且那会儿我女儿还没出世
And plus my daughter wasn't born yet.

415
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:33,005
所以一定得在霍莉出生之后才行
It had to be after Holly was born.

416
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,072
怀特老师
Mr. White--

417
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,092
肯定也得在我做手术之前
Definitely before the surgery.

418
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,016
天啊
Oh, Christ.

419
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,027
该死的手机二号
That damn second cell phone.

420
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,017
我怎么可能会...
I mean how could I possibly...

421
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:59,011
我知道了
Ah, I know the moment.

422
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:06,055
应该是珍妮死的那个晚上
It was the night Jane died.

423
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:21,001
我当时在家  家里尿布用完了
I was at home and we needed diapers,

424
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,060
所以我说我去买
and so I said I'd go,

425
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:25,040
但那只是个借口
but it was just an excuse.

426
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:27,020
实际上  那晚
Actually, that was the night I--

427
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:30,003
我去给你送钱去了  记得吗
I brought you your money, remember?

428
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:33,060
恩  记得
Yeah, I remember.

429
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:37,093
但那之后  我去了家酒吧
But afterward I stopped at a bar.

430
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:42,093
太奇怪了  我从没一个人去过酒吧
It was odd. I never do that, go to a bar alone.

431
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:45,070
我走了进去  坐了下来
I just walked in, sat down.

432
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,041
我一直没跟你提过
I never told you.

433
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,034
提什么  你去了间酒吧吗
That you went to a bar?

434
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,075
我坐下后  有个男人  一个陌生人
I sit down, and this man, this stranger,

435
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:08,058
他过来我和搭话
he engages me in conversation.

436
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,025
完全是个陌生人
He's a complete stranger.

437
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:16,053
但后来我发现  他是珍妮的父亲
But he turns out to be Jane's father,

438
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,070
唐纳德·马戈利斯
Donald Margolis.

439
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,033
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

440
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:24,017
我当时并不认识他
Of course I didn't know it at the time.

441
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,030
我以为只是个在酒吧喝酒的人
I mean, it was just some guy in a bar.

442
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:30,027
直到坠机事件之后  新闻里到处
Didn't put it together until after the crash

443
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,054
都在报道他的时候  我才想起来
when he was all over the news.

444
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:34,021
珍妮的父亲
Jane's dad.

445
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:37,058
你想下这几率有多小
I mean, think of the odds.

446
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:39,018
我试着去算了下
Once I tried to calculate them,

447
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,045
但是太复杂了
but they're astronomical.

448
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:44,006
想想看这几率
I mean, think of the odds

449
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,099
恰好是我  恰好是那晚  恰好那酒吧
of me going in, sitting down

450
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:49,092
恰好坐那男人的旁边
that night in that bar next to that man.

451
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:55,002
你们聊什么了
What did you talk about?

452
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:02,050
火星上的水源
Oh, water on Mars.

453
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,060
家庭
Family.

454
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:11,077
关于家庭的都聊了什么
What about family?

455
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,031
我告诉他我有个女儿
I told him that I had a daughter,

456
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:21,021
他说他也有一个
and he told me he had one, too.

457
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:25,061
然后他说  永远不要放弃家人
Then he said, "Never give up on family."

458
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:34,062
所以我听他的了  没有放弃家人
And I didn't. I-- I took his advice.

459
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,049
宇宙是随机的
The universe is random.

460
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,043
可变的
It's not inevitable.

461
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:56,046
是混乱的
It's simple chaos.

462
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,047
是无休止的  无序的  亚原子粒子间的碰撞
It's subatomic particles in endless, aimless collision.

463
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:03,097
这是科学教予我们的
That's what science teaches us,

464
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,070
但这又是什么意思呢
but what is this saying?

465
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:10,027
就恰巧在那一晚
What is it telling us,

466
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:16,018
和我喝酒的那个人的女儿死了
when on the very night that this man's daughter dies,

467
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:19,088
这是想告诉我们什么呢
it's me who's having a drink with him?

468
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,042
这怎么会是随机的呢
How can that be random?

469
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,036
坐下来吧
Hey, sit down.

470
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,083
不  不
No-- No.

471
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:34,043
不坐
No, it's--

472
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:46,031
不  就是那个时刻
No, that-- that was the moment.

473
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:50,012
那天晚上
That night.

474
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:55,059
我不该离开家
I should never have left home.

475
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,093
不该去你家
Never gone to your house.

476
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,017
这样事情也许会...
Maybe things would have--

477
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,065
我以为我...
Oh, thought I was--

478
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:22,069
在家看电视
I was at home watching TV.

479
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:27,023
看些
Some--

480
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:31,027
看些关于大象的自然节目
Some nature program about elephants.

481
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:36,052
斯凯勒和霍莉在另外一间房
Skyler and Holly were in another room.

482
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,023
我可以从婴儿监视器里听到她们的声音
I could hear them on the baby monitor.

483
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:48,024
我听到她在唱摇篮曲
She was singing a lullaby.

484
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:01,097
如果能停在那一刻
If had just lived right up to that moment

485
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,092
就在那一刻
and not one second more--

486
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:20,074
...将是多么完美
...that would've been perfect.

487
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,027
它不会下来了
He's not coming down.

488
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:41,008
上面肯定跟泰国一样热
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

489
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:44,041
所以它喜欢那
That's why he likes it.

490
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:48,052
泰国很热对吧
Thailand's hot, right?

491
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,079
嗯
Yeah.

492
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:53,039
我就知道
See? That's why.

493
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:54,083
天
Oh, Jesus.

494
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:56,027
等等
Hey, wait.

495
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,030
坐这儿
Here.

496
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,068
它不会下来了
He's not coming down.

497
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:18,089
它要在那儿待一辈子
He's staying up there forever.

498
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,059
你在  你在干嘛
What are you-- What are you doing?

499
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:49,059
你以为呢  我要去干了它
What do you think? I'm going to get that bitch.

500
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,049
不行  你会摔断脖子的
No, you're going to break your neck.

501
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:59,050
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah. Just--

502
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:04,050
我说真的呢  这可不是个好主意
No, seriously, you're-- This is a bad idea.

503
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:07,074
该死
Damn it.

504
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:10,026
杰西
Jesse.

505
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,060
帮我扶稳就好了
Just hold onto it.

506
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:13,073
扶稳了吗
Hold it still?

507
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,058
杰西
Jesse.

508
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:35,088
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,062
抱什么歉
Sorry for what?

510
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,079
因为你突然发疯吗
Being a lunatic?

511
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:44,083
珍妮的事  我很抱歉
I'm sorry about Jane.

512
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,060
我也很抱歉
Yeah. Me, too.

513
00:40:57,064 --> 00:41:00,064
不  我是说...
No, I mean, uh--

514
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:06,045
我非常抱歉
I'm very sorry.

515
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,026
那不是你的错
It's not your fault.

516
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,053
也不是我的错
But it's not mine either.

517
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:22,060
更不是她的错  谁都没错
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

518
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:38,000
本性难移你知道吗  怀特老师
We are who we are, Mr. White.

519
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:43,077
我俩就是瘾君子  有了钱又怎样
You know, just two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash.

520
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:47,038
还不是像你说的  活不过一个礼拜
Like you said, we both would've been dead within a week.

521
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:50,088
但我还是很想念她
But I miss her, though.

522
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:57,002
真的很想她
God, I do.

523
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:09,020
杰西  下来吧
Jesse, come down.

524
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,053
等等  就差那么一点点
Wait, I am so close.

525
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:18,000
别管它了
Let it go.

526
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,054
我们得开始制毒了
We need to cook.

527
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:22,040
那这"污染物"怎么办
What about the contamination?

528
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:25,097
反正都已经污染了
It's all contaminated.

529
00:42:35,005 --> 00:42:36,069
我应该是吓到它了
I definitely scared him.

530
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,032
它应该不会再回来了
Probably stay out of our way--

531
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:17,016
死  终于干死你了
Zap! Somebody got got, yo!

532
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,023
你看到了吗
You see that, Mister--

533
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,098
都包好了吗
Bins are packed?

534
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:10,005
包好了
Bins are packed.

535
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:13,036
产量如何
How's the yield?

536
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,066
202磅  有点零头
Two-oh-two and change.

537
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,033
你一个人回家没事吧
You okay getting home?

538
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,076
嗯  我好多了
Yeah. Better.

539
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,093
谢谢
Thanks.

540
00:44:21,096 --> 00:44:23,063
那么  日安
Ma?ana, then.

541
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:41,052
杰西  过来一下
Jesse, come here.

542
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,079
我刚在里面不好说
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

543
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:50,002
因为里面可能被监视着
For all I know, the lab's wired for sound.

544
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:56,057
我们之前提到的那半磅
That half a pound that I said we're off by--

545
00:44:57,016 --> 00:45:00,056
我不是想责怪你什么  但如果...
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

546
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,077
你明白的
You understand?

547
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,087
如果他们发现了...
And if they ever found out--

548
00:45:08,054 --> 00:45:10,091
我才不鸟他们
I didn't take shit.

549
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,045
我只是说  我可能就没法保护你了
I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you.

550
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:23,012
谁让你保护了
Who's asking you to?
