00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,066
这些人
These people.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,088
太可悲了
Pathetic.

9
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,002
我早就看过这个了
I already read that one anyway.

10
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:37,022
克兰曼的杂志比这里好多了
Kleinman has better magazines.

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,069
其实你们不用都来的
You know, you guys really don't need to hang around.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,037
下周才会出检查结果
We won't even get the results till next week.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,024
兄弟  我们当然要来  别开玩笑了
Buddy, we're going to be here. You kidding me?

14
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,098
是全套的正电子电脑断层扫描吗
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

15
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:53,015
确实是全套的  不只是正电子发射断层扫描
You definitely want the PET/CT and not just the PET.

16
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:56,057
是正电子电脑断层扫描
It's a PET/CT.

17
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,033
很好  你要的就是那个
Good. That's what you want.

18
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,043
因为有些地方会偷工减料
Some places skimp,

19
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,021
有时候他们只做正电子发射断层扫描
And they only do the PET.

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,000
我不会点名道姓  但是
I'm not naming any names, but...

21
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,055
我只是搞不懂你们为什么不去克兰曼
I just still don't understand why you don't go to Kleinman.

22
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,047
可是沃尔特的主治医生在这里
This is where Walt's doctor is.

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,059
但是在我们医院做  你们就不用
With us, you wouldn't have to wait

24
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,058
等到下星期才拿报告
until next week to get the results.

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,069
对不起  但是这些扫描图并不难解读
I'm sorry, but these scans are not that difficult to read.

26
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:22,049
我只要看一眼沃尔特的扫描图
I could take one look at Walt's

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,070
就能立刻知道他的情况
And tell you immediately how he's doing.

28
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:25,069
真的不用了
Really.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,003
医生总喜欢让人觉得  他们比技术人员聪明
Doctors like people to think that they're so much smarter

30
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:33,005
但他们录入病人信息的时候
Than the technicians, but you would be surprised

31
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,003
不知道要问我们多少问题
How much they come to us for input.

32
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:43,025
我得去上个厕所
Never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom, huh?

33
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,083
不好意思
Excuse me.

34
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,046
你没事吧
You all right in there?

35
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:06,036
你还好吗
You okay?

36
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,051
很好  谢谢
I'm fine, thank you.

37
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,058
先生  你可以去更衣室换衣服了
Sir, you can go back to your changing room and get dressed.

38
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,020
我做得怎么样
So, how'd we do?

39
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,013
你做得很好
You did fine.

40
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:51,014
-看见什么了吗  -我只是个技术员  怀特老师
- See anything? - I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

41
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:54,026
戴尔克沃利医生下周会通知你检查的结果
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results with you next week.

42
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:55,026
抱歉
Sorry.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
绝

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
命

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
毒

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
师

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
第二季

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,020
第九集

49
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,061
事实上  洗钱还是挺容易的
Actually, the money laundering aspect is fairly straightforward.

50
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:41,030
但是要记住一点  不要告诉你妻子
But I gotta tell ya, the not-telling-your-wife aspect...

51
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:44,026
一下子变得有钱  多数人都会有怀疑
Most people want to know why they suddenly got rich.

52
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,058
她要发现的话  也是在我死后了
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

53
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:50,070
他们说你还有多少时间
How much time they giving you?

54
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,049
几星期吧
Weeks.

55
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,030
可能
Maybe.

56
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,057
太遗憾了
Sorry to hear it.

57
00:03:56,086 --> 00:04:00,055
我还希望我们能合作赚大钱
I was hoping we could make some real money together.

58
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,069
我们来算算帐
Oh, well. Let's crunch some numbers.

59
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,096
我们要洗多少钱
How much money are we laundering?

60
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:11,002
这次16000美元
At this time, $16,000.

61
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,069
你干这个有多久了
How long have you been doing this?

62
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,089
我们刚刚出了状况
We've had some extenuating circumstances.

63
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,030
当然
Apparently.

64
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,054
好的  16000
All right, 16,000

65
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,060
洗钱要打75折
Laundered at 75 cents on the dollar,

66
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,037
减去我的劳务费
Minus my fee,

67
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,059
17%
Which is 17%,

68
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:33,035
一共是9960美元  恭喜你
Comes to $9,960. Congratulations.

69
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,043
你给家人留下了一辆二手速霸路车
You just left your family a secondhand Subaru.

70
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:39,071
我们会制更多毒  很多很多
We'll just have to cook more, a lot more.

71
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,048
那正是我的律师意见
That's my legal opinion.

72
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,026
趁热打铁  抓紧时间
Make hay while the sun is still shining.

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,075
我们这个周末应该安排点节目
You know, we should do something this weekend.

74
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,010
好让我们别去想检查结果
Get our minds off the test results?

75
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,046
事实上  我
Actually, I...

76
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:08,010
我在想该去看看妈妈
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

77
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,077
我从来没给她打过电话
You know, I never did call her.

78
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,076
你觉得
You're expecting the...

79
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,036
扫描的结果会不好
The news from the scan to be bad.

80
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,092
天哪  沃尔特
God. Walt.

81
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,069
我需要你跟我一起积极乐观面对
I need you to stay positive with me here.

82
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,090
我是的
I am.

83
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,088
乐观积极很好
Positive is good.

84
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:45,046
我很乐观  但是乐观不能改变事实
I'm all for positive, but positive doesn't change facts.

85
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,099
懂吗
All right?

86
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:52,026
不改变我们需要做好准备的事实
It doesn't change the need to be prepared.

87
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:53,019
我知道
I know.

88
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,071
我只是想给自己希望
I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay?

89
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,000
原谅我
You know? Forgive me.

90
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,002
听着
Look,

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,008
我想知道妈妈是否会留给你点东西  如果
I need to know Mom's going to leave you something if...

92
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,001
如果我不在了
If I'm no longer around.

93
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:15,008
我只是想去直接问问她  仅此而已
I just need to get that straight. That's all.

94
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,061
相信我  我会竭尽全力为你争取的
And believe me, I'm going to earn every penny of it, too.

95
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,033
整天抱怨服侍她的护士
Complaining about her nurses the entire time.

96
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,011
"胡妮安塔把我的烟灰缸藏起来了"
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

97
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:36,024
然后发表30分钟的
A 30-minute discourse about

98
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:40,058
关于糖袋子的突然失踪的长篇大论
How the sugar packets are suddenly disappearing.

99
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,085
她一天到晚在唠叨那些东西
And, oh, she's counting every one of them. You know?

100
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,084
要是我能插上嘴就不错了
I'll be lucky if I get a word in edgewise.

101
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,014
我反而觉得扫描的结果会很好
I actually think the news from the scan is going to be good.

102
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,043
可能你也该有个心理准备
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

103
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,075
我们得干点什么
We should do something.

104
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,042
没错
Yeah, we should.

105
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,086
不是  干点别的
No, something else.

106
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:35,043
我们应该出去玩

107

你去过乔治娅·欧基夫博物馆吗
Have you been to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

108
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,017
展览原子弹的地方吗
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

109
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,011
乔治娅·欧基夫
Georgia O'Keeffe.

110
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,058
她是个画家

你从没听说过乔治娅·欧基夫吗
You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?

112
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,035
谁
Who is it?

113
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,006
你该上点课了

You want to go all the way to Santa Fe for a museum?

117

没错  我们要出发了  快起来
Yep, we're going. Get up.

118
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:15,045
不能看场电影  或者玩玩碰碰车吗
Why can't we just go to the movies or putt-putt?

119
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,032
博物馆太无聊了
It's the shit.

120
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,040
让你熏陶点文化又不会死
A little culture won't kill you.

121
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,036

Besides, you might like it.

很多她的画都像是阴道

123
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,060

如果我认识你  就留个言

我一直在打你电话  你手机上呢

141
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,048
去你的  伙计
Screw you and your book, man.

我要去圣达菲的博物馆  不用告诉你

All you need to know is

154
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:58,003
我今天不会制毒  买东西或干类似的事
I ain't cooking, shopping or whatever.

155
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:59,082
我来解释给你听
Let me explain something to you.

156
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:03,012
你和我必须要一直制毒到下周二
You and I need to cook through to next Tuesday.

157
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,019
周二  连着四天
Tuesday? Four days straight?

158
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:07,071
不管你喜不喜欢  我们别无选择
Like it or not, we have no choice.

159
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,019
那到底为什么
And why, exactly, is that?

160
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:15,021
我们的甲胺  快变质了
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

161
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,081
-什么  -会慢慢失去化学反应能力
- What? - It's losing its chemical potency.

162
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:21,045
除非你想再去偷一桶
Now, unless stealing another barrel sounds good to you...

163
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,052
见鬼的  当然不
Hell, no.

164
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:25,035
那我们就必须在它变质前抓紧制毒
We have to act fast before it goes to waste.

165
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,053
有笔和纸吗
You have a paper and pencil?

166
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:33,003
-快点  -好了  说吧
- Come on. - All right, all right. Go.

167
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,098
我还是希望你别去了  
I wish you didn't have to do this.

168
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,074
我也不想去啊
Me, too.

169
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:46,004
我会尽快回来
But I'll be back before you know it,

170
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,041
如果需要我  就打电话
And you can always call if you need me.

171
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:50,079
还要冒险和你妈妈讲话吗
And risk talking to your mother?

172
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:53,006
那可要是紧急事件了
That'd have to be some emergency.

173
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:04,056
爱你
Love you.

174
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,046
路上小心
Fly safe, okay?

175
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,032
你居然把制毒室开到机场来
You brought a meth lab to the airport?

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,066
怎么  你说要快点  这不省了一趟路
What? You said we were in a hurry. I saved us a trip.

177
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,094
所有东西都买好了吗  六样东西
Did you get everything? All six?

178
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,017
带回流冷凝器的吗
With reflux condensers?

179
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,083
没错
Yes, like I said.

180
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,057
那快走  开车啊
Just go. Drive. Go, go.

181
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,032
你也早上好  伙计
Good morning to you, too, man.

182
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,041
-太傻了  -三大袋洋葱圈
- Stupid... - Three entire bags of Funyuns?

183
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,003
怎么  洋葱圈很好吃
What? Funyuns are awesome.

184
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,056
-天哪  -没有给我的吗
- God. - More for me.

185
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:34,078
没有含蛋白质的吗
How about something with some protein, maybe?

186
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,070
健康食品
Something green, huh?

187
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,005
天哪  我手机没信号
Man, I'm getting no service.

188
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:44,089
你是怎么活着的
How are you even alive?

189
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,036
唷  看看你手机
Yo, check your phone.

190
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,095
有信号吗
You get any bars?

191
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,072
有一格
I've got a signal.

192
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,039
让我用下你手机吧
Let me use yours, would ya?

193
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,085
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

194
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,017
我得考虑到斯凯勒会查我的通讯记录
I have to assume Skyler checks my phone records. You know that.

195
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,005
-不是生意上的事  私人电话  -私人
- It's not business. It's personal. - Oh, personal.

196
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:07,023
-女的吗  -有可能
- What, female? - Maybe.

197
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:10,023
当然是  我猜就是
Absolutely, that's all I need.

198
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,084
斯凯勒重播号码  然后发现是脱衣舞女
Skyler hits "redial" and some stripper answers.

199
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:16,013
听着  她才不是脱衣舞娘  好吗  伙计
Look, she's not a stripper. Okay, dickwad?

200
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:19,046
我妻子会检查的
My wife checks.

201
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,076
饮用水吗
Drinking water?

202
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,047
就这些吗
Is that all we've got?

203
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,081
10加仑
Ten gallons?

204
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,064
怎么  你还打算在里面洗澡吗
What, you planning on taking a bath in it?

205
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,069
天哪
Oh, God.

206
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:46,055
别放那里  那是我们的工作台
Not there. That is our work station.

207
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:50,004
-工作台  -没错
- Our work station.  - That's right.

208
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:54,049
你干嘛不找个不会掉的地方放好
Why don't you try to find a place where it won't get lost?

209
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:56,064
考虑到这是我们唯一的一串钥匙
Considering this is our only set

210
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:59,032
我们现在还身处荒野
And we are a million miles from nowhere.

211
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:08,047
你怎么不把钥匙粘在你的屁股旁边
Why don't you try sticking them up your ass sideways?

212
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,016
2.35磅
2.35 pounds.

213
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,008
2.35
2.35.

214
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,053
这是最后一包了
That's the last of it.

215
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,027
总共多少
How many total?

216
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,073
19包
19.

217
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:27,007
按钱算呢
Dollar-wise?

218
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,097
多少
How much?

219
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,012
重量中间数  是2.2磅
Well, median weight... 2.2 pounds.

220
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:35,059
一共41.8磅
That's 41.8,

221
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:39,053
算是42磅  我们最近卖多少钱
Call it 42 pounds at... What are we selling it for these days?

222
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,038
-4万一磅  -四万美元吗
- 40 a pound. - $40,000?

223
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:43,045
是你说要涨价的
You said raise the prices.

224
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:46,047
好的  40乘以42
All right, that's 40 times 42,

225
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,094
减掉分成的钱
Minus distribution charges.

226
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,069
多少
What?

227
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,042
多少
What?

228
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,009
67200美元
$672,000.

229
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,022
总共吗
All that?

230
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,016
每人
Each?

231
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,037
每人
Each.

232
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:13,035
-每人六十  - 七万两千美元
- Six hundred and... - Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

233
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,039
太好了
Hell, yeah!

234
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,089
高兴点  宝贝  快来
Come high, baby! Come on!

235
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:31,073
发电机的声音
Well, there goes the generator.

236
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,033
我猜是没汽油了
I think that's it for the gas.

237
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,035
时间正好  唷
Perfect timing, yo.

238
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,039
你怎么知道
How do you figure that?

239
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,029
你什么意思  我们已经弄完了
What do you mean? We're done cooking.

240
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,062
要到甲胺用完为止
I am not done until this barrel is empty.

241
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,011
我来看一下
Look at that.

242
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:49,034
我们还有10或者12加仑的甲胺
I'd say we still got 10, 12 gallons of methylamine.

243
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:50,088
别这样  你的野心到哪里去了  
Come on, where's your ambition?

244
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,020
上帝啊  你是认真的吗
Jesus. Seriously?

245
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,060
我们已经超额完成了
We are way ahead of schedule.

246
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,011
而且发电机也没汽油了  丙烷也快没了
Plus, the genny needs gas, we're almost out of propane,

247
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,001
而且在这破地方呆得我背快痛死了
And my back is killing me from that piece-of-crap cot.

248
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:04,029
我们能不能至少休息一个晚上
Come on, can we at least just take the night off.

249
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:06,037
星期二之前你也不用回去  对吗
Look, I don't have to take you back till Tuesday, right?

250
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,078
我们明天再来
So we come back tomorrow,

251
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:11,026
再继续搞这些玻璃东西
Strap on the sizzle and glass up the rest.

252
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,039
就这样吧
Come on!

253
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,047
周围总会有个小旅馆什么的
There's got to be a Denny's out there someplace.

254
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:16,082
看看篮球
Grand Slam?

255
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,007
洗个热水澡
A hot shower?

256
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,005
分开住
Separate rooms.

257
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,036
那是条件
That's a given.

258
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,085
没电了
The battery's dead.

259
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:45,042
我叫你把钥匙放在安全的地方
Back when I asked you to put the keys in a safe place,

260
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,094
你放哪里了
Where did you put them?

261
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:49,075
我插在了点火器上
I left them right here in the ignition.

262
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:52,014
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

263
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:55,051
这不是我的错  警报器坏了
This is not my fault. The buzzer didn't buzz.

264
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,098
-什么  -警报器
- The what? - The buzzer.

265
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,039
你把钥匙插进去的时候
It buzzes when you put the keys in

266
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,019
警报器会响  提醒你电池开着
To let you know that the battery's on.

267
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,009
我知道  但是没报警
I know that. It didn't buzz.

268
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:05,080
听着  我没有转钥匙  我不笨
Look, I didn't turn the key or anything. I'm not stupid.

269
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,011
你听到报警了吗
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

270
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,040
这是机械故障
It's faulty. It's a faulty mechanism.

271
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:13,026
这毛病是遗传的  还是你天生的
Is this a genetic thing with you? Is it congenital?

272
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,080
婴儿的时候  你妈是不是打过你的头
Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby?

273
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,015
警报器坏了
The buzzer did not buzz,

274
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,047
而且是你一开始让我把钥匙放好的
And you made me move the keys in the first place,

275
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:21,049
-记得吗  -我明白你的意思了
- Remember? - I see your point.

276
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:24,056
你低能到  我必须要告诉你
Your imbecility being what it is, I should have known to say,

277
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:27,048
别让钥匙插在点火器里整整两天
"Don't leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days!"

278
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:30,027
我原来是要放在柜子上的  白痴
I wanted to leave them on the counter, bitch!

279
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:32,082
对不起  应该是工作台
Oh, I'm sorry. The work station.

280
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:42,095
我们得想办法充电
All right, so we need to jump the battery somehow.

281
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:46,055
怎么弄
OK. How?

282
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,002
你没事吧
You going to be okay?

283
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,026
该死
Damn it.

284
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,034
什么味道
What's it taste like?

285
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,096
糟透了吗
Bad, huh?

286
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,009
好的  就放这里
This is good. Right here.

287
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,022
给  红的接红  黑的接黑
Here. Red to red, black to black.

288
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:28,067
正极  负极
Positive, negative.

289
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,048
好了  发动
All right. Start it up.

290
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:37,002
这东西怎么回事
The hell's wrong with this thing?

291
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:38,089
你得用力拉
You have to really pull.

292
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,040
我在用力
I am.

293
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,095
用力气  别像个娘儿们
Really pull. Not like a girl.

294
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:45,076
我正在拉  要么你自己来
You know what? Pull this. I am pulling.

295
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:47,091
这玩意儿也需要一点热身
It just needs to warm up a little.

296
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,065
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus.

297
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,043
干得好
Well done.

298
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,081
跟往常一样  就只会
As always. Just...

299
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,055
干得好
Well done.

300
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:30,016
上帝啊
God.

301
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:54,010
快点啊  他妈的
Come on, you bitches.

302
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:56,047
信号快来啊
Hear me now.

303
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,000
妈的
Damn it!

304
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:08,080
太傻了
This is stupid.

305
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,033
我们现在必须要用你的手机了
Okay, now we have to use your phone.

306
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:18,099
这东西毁了  明白吗  毁了
This is ruined. Do you understand? Just ruined.

307
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:21,073
我知道你把线接错了  所以爆炸了
I understand you hooked it up wrong and you blew it up.

308
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,095
-不是这样的  -你怎么知道
- That is not what happened. - How do you know?

309
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:28,070
把我们最后点水倒上去的可不是我
I wasn't the one who dumped out the last of our water.

310
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,038
就我所知的就这些
That's what I know.

311
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,058
着火了  抱歉我没有考虑周到
There was a fire. Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

312
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,067
那就是你想的吗
Is that... You were thinking.

313
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,076
现在我们来搞清楚状况
Now that we have identified the problem.

314
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:39,036
你和你那愚蠢的想法  那才是问题所在
You and thinking, that's the problem.

315
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:43,047
听着  必须得有人来接我们
Look, somebody is going to have to pick us up.

316
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:47,073
你妻子是不会注意到一个小电话的
Your wife is not going to notice one little call.

317
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,013
怀特老师  快点
Mr. White, come on.

318
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,096
好的  听着
All right, look.

319
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:57,013
干脆一点  别说废话
Make it snappy.

320
00:23:57,084 --> 00:24:00,069
-漫游很费电的  -好的
- The roaming drains the battery. - All right.

321
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:05,098
唷  瘦子
Yo, Skinny, hey.

322
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:09,032
听着  你必须马上来接我们
Listen, I need you to come pick us up.

323
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,072
现在  好吗  我们被困在这儿了
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.

324
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,080
你有笔吗  写下方向
You got a pen for directions?

325
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:16,008
铅笔当然行  别磨叽
A pencil's fine, retard.

326
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,075
能写字的就行  没关系
Just something to write with. It doesn't matter.

327
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,050
好的  准备好了吗
All right, so you ready?

328
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:23,027
你要延着40号公路向西
So you're going to head west on the 40 for,

329
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:24,062
开大约30里
Like, what, 30 miles?

330
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,082
你会经过一个赌场
And you're just gonna go past the casino

331
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:28,078
停车场上有个大箭头的
With the big arrows in the parking lot.

332
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,009
大箭头  超级大的那种
Big arrows, giant arrows.

333
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:34,016
会闪的那种  你肯定能看见
They light up and blink and shit. You can't miss them.

334
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,091
然后你得减速
But then you're gonna want to take it slow

335
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:37,087
右边会有条泥路
Because there's this dirt road right

336
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:40,069
路口会有个写着3的白牌子
Before this white sign with a 3 on it, okay?

337
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,073
然后你就沿着路开  进入郊区
Now, you're going to be way, way out in the boonies, okay?

338
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:45,052
非常非常远
Like, crazy far, so you just got to

339
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,072
你要一直沿着那条泥路开
Keep heading down that dirt road for what?

340
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,063
大概15英里
About another 15 miles.

341
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,033
真的那么远
Really? That far?

342
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,015
快点  会没电的
Hurry up. The battery.

343
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,099
沿着路开  大概15英里
Just go down that road for, like, 15 more miles.

344
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:59,000
我们离公路远着呢
I mean, we're way the hell out here.

345
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:01,033
唷  听着
And yo, listen.

346
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:02,069
带点水来
Bring water.

347
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,075
现在就出发
Leave now.

348
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:08,087
他来了
He's coming.

349
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:17,075
探索频道放过有个人
There was this guy on the Discovery Channel

350
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:20,063
爬山的时候摔断了腿
Who broke his leg mountain biking,

351
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,019
还要喝自己的尿来求生
And he had to drink urine for,

352
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
直到护林员找到他
You know, just until the forest ranger found him.

353
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:29,082
他说尿尝起来很烫
He said it tasted like really hot,

354
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:32,071
像以前的苏打水
Really old soda.

355
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,048
我们应该打电话
We should just call.

356
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,079
我会讲得很快的  
You know? I'll be quick. Just be like,

357
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,044
唷  你在哪里
"Yo, where are you?"

358
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,030
好吧
All right.

359
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,030
快点
Come on.

360
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:02,041
唷  你在哪里
Yo, where are you?

361
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,052
你看见白牌子了吗
So you saw the white sign?

362
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,079
他快来了
He's almost here.

363
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,061
伙计
Oh, man.

364
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,099
我们真的快疯了
We're getting really freaked out.

365
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:15,007
好的  那你现在在泥路上了吗
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

366
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,012
他在泥路上了  很好
He's on the dirt road. Good.

367
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,031
你刚刚过了河
You just crossed the river?

368
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:23,012
-你看见什么东西了吗  -等等  什么河
- Have you seen anything? - Wait, wait. What river?

369
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,016
什么河  你在说什么  伙计
What river? What the hell river you talking about, man?

370
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:28,068
没有河
There's no river.

371
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,046
你能不能
Can you...

372
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,055
电话没电了
Phone's dead.

373
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,094
现在怎么办
Now what?

374
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,075
现在怎么办
What now?

375
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,032
说话啊  我说真的
Come on. Seriously?

376
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:26,096
这是什么
What's this?

377
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,024
我正试着
I'm trying to

378
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,025
一点一点给电池充电
Trickle-charge the battery.

379
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,084
说真的吗
Seriously?

380
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:39,088
就这样转这东西
Just by turning that thing?

381
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,049
整流器
The commutator.

382
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:45,021
这也是发电机原理的一部分
It's the part which generates the electricity.

383
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:50,024
通常情况下  活塞发动机会转动它
Usually, this little piston engine turns it,

384
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:54,067
但是现在已经完全没用了
But considering it's lying here completely totaled...

385
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:00,023
无论如何
Anyway.

386
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:05,068
只能来点体力活了
Apply a little elbow grease...

387
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:08,012
会花很长时间的
It'll take longer.

388
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:09,084
很长时间
A lot longer.

389
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,069
但是理论上
But theoretically,

390
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,008
应该能行
It should work.

391
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,065
理论上
Theoretically.

392
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,067
必须得行
It has to work.

393
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,015
明白吗
You understand?

394
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,037
让我试试
Can I try?

395
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,075
要多久
How much longer?

396
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:27,052
我不知道
I don't know.

397
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,046
怀特老师
Mr. White?

398
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,050
你快不行了吗
You hanging in?

399
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,026
我很好
I'm good.

400
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:21,018
应该差不多了吧
It's got to be ready by now. Right?

401
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,062
再多摇一会儿
Give it a little longer,

402
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,079
保证我们能够
Just to make sure we're...

403
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:47,078
甲胺不会变质  是吗
Methylamine doesn't spoil, does it?

404
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,073
那不是我们来这里的原因吧
That's not why we're here.

405
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,084
对我撒谎了
Lie much?

406
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,014
快点摇
Push.

407
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:43,032
快点
Come on.

408
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,085
求你了
Please.

409
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:21,056
求你了
Please.

410
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:44,007
我为什么不直接去圣达菲呢
Why couldn't I have just gone to Santa Fe?

411
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,058
为什么
Why?

412
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,076
怀特老师
Mr. White?

413
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,074
怀特老师
Mr. White?

414
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,086
你在干什么
What are you doing?

415
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,075
我的报应
I had this coming.

416
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,075
我的报应
I have it coming.

417
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,071
我活该
I deserve this.

418
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,069
你会好起来的
You snap out of it.

419
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,058
你做的每件事都是为了你的家人
First off, everything you did, you did for your family.

420
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:53,091
对吗
Right?

421
00:33:55,078 --> 00:34:03,097
我只是让他们更担心更失望  还有谎言
All I ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie.

422
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:07,034
上帝啊
God.

423
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:09,071
所有的谎言
All the lies.

424
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:13,053
我都没法
I can't even...

425
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:17,051
我自己都不敢去想
I can't even keep them straight in my head anymore.

426
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,090
知道吗
You know what?

427
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:22,038
去他妈的  我要走着离开这里
Screw this. I'm walking.

428
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,085
你可以选择跟或不跟
You can come or not.

429
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,086
我另一只鞋呢
Where's my other shoe?

430
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,056
杰西 杰西
Jesse, Jesse

431
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,040
你现在处于低电解质的高危状态
Your body is running dangerously low on electrolytes.

432
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:47,058
钠  钾  钙
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

433
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,061
等到全部流失的时候
And when they're gone,

434
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:55,021
你的大脑就会停止指挥
Your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles.

435
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,019
你的肺就会停止呼吸
Your lungs stop breathing,

436
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,095
心脏会停止泵血
Your heart stops pumping.

437
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:05,007
你要是走出去
You go marching out there,

438
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:07,043
一小时内
And within an hour,

439
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:09,061
你就会死
You will be dead.

440
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:14,035
你立刻收起你那副可怜兮兮的样子
You need to cut out all your loser cry-baby crap right now

441
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,068
想点科学的点子出来
And think of something scientific!

442
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,058
科学的  是吗
Something scientific, right.

443
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,024
怎么了  快点
What? Come on.

444
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,074
你那么聪明
You're smart.

445
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,074
你从豆子里都能炼出毒品来
You made poison out of beans.

446
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,099
好吧  听着
All right, look.

447
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:33,029
这里我们有整个实验室
We got an entire lab right here.

448
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:37,048
我们把这些化学试剂加起来
All right? How about you take some of these chemicals

449
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:39,055
弄个什么火箭燃料
And mix up some rocket fuel?

450
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:42,068
至少能发个信号什么的
That way, you can just send up a signal flare.

451
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:46,020
要么你造个机器人帮我们
Or you make some kind of robot to get us help,

452
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,075
要么弄个自动追踪系统
Or a homing device or...

453
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:51,047
或者造个新电池
Build a new battery or...

454
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,077
等等
Wait. No.

455
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:56,032
不如我们把车上的东西拆下来
What if we just take some stuff off of the RV

456
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:59,063
造一个不一样的车出来
And build it into something completely different?

457
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:02,025
像是沙漠越野车什么的
Like a dune buggy.

458
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:05,046
那样的话  我们至少能越野了
That way, we can just dune buggy...

459
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,088
怎么了
What is it?

460
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:13,031
怎么了
What?

461
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,097
你有钱吗
Do you have any money?

462
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:21,009
-零钱  硬币  -我有一堆
- Change, I mean. Coins. - I got a bunch of them.

463
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:24,052
收集起来
Then gather them.

464
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:28,026
还有那些金属垫圈  螺丝  螺栓  钉子  
And washers and nuts and bolts and screws

465
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,012
各种各样的金属零件
And whatever little pieces of metal

466
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:31,081
只要是镀锌的都行
We can think of that is galvanized.

467
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:35,048
必须镀锌的  或者本身就是纯锌的
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

468
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:40,034
-纯锌的  好  -帮我把刹车垫拿来
- Solid zinc, right. - And bring me brake pads.

469
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,091
前轮应该有的
The front wheels should have discs.

470
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:44,089
拆下来给我
Take them off and bring them to me.

471
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,088
刹车垫
Brake pads.

472
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,063
-我们要造什么  -你自己说的
- What are we building? - You said it yourself.

473
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,044
机器人吗
A robot?

474
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,070
电池
A battery.

475
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:00,009
快去
Move!

476
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:15,083
跟我见过的所有电池都不一样
This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.

477
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,078
相信我  这就是电池
Well, trust me. It is a battery.

478
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,094
或者说  是原电池
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

479
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:26,060
给  把海绵剪成两半
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

480
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,073
还记得电解质吗
Remember the electrolytes?

481
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,027
动动脑子
Think about it.

482
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,081
电池其实也就是原电池
A battery is a galvanic cell.

483
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,000
也就是阳极和阴极
It's no more than an anode and a cathode

484
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,044
离子在电解液里分开
Separated by an electrolyte, right?

485
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:43,025
-没错  -不管怎么样
- Right. - Well, anyway.

486
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,095
一极我们用氧化汞
On one side, we have mercuric oxide

487
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:49,051
还有刹车垫上的石墨
And graphite from your brake pads.

488
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:51,069
组成阴极
This is the cathode.

489
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:53,094
也就是电池的正极
This is the positive terminal.

490
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:57,081
电流就是从那里出来的
This is where the supply of current flows out from.

491
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,008
然后
Then...

492
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:03,093
看我做  另外一边就是我们的阳极
Here, I'll show you. On the opposite side is our anode.

493
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:05,046
这个
This...

494
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,037
是锌的
It's zinc.

495
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:13,010
就是我们找到的硬币和所有镀锌的东西
It's what we find in our coins and anything galvanized.

496
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:17,051
海绵就是电解液吗
So, the sponge is the electrolyte?

497
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:21,086
不  氢氧化钾是电解液
No, the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte.

498
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:25,032
也对  这就是为什么我要用海绵去吸
But yes, that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.

499
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,025
不错
Good.

500
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,023
很好  现在
Good. And now,

501
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:37,043
我们要用什么来传导电流呢
What shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with?

502
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:42,032
想到了什么元素
What one particular element comes to mind?

503
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:49,074
一根电线
A wire.

504
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:53,078
是铜
Copper.

505
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:56,084
-我是说  -是铜
- Well, I mean... - It's copper.

506
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:03,029
唯一的问题是需要多少这样的原电池单元
The only question now is will this supply enough current?

507
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,018
我们要做多少
And how many cells will we need?

508
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:09,054
我们的材料应该够做六个
Maybe we've only got material enough for six.

509
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:21,032
-要把盖子盖上吗  -等等
- Put the lid on. - Wait.

510
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,066
正极
Positive.

511
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,051
阴极
Cathode.

512
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:34,031
阳极
Anode.

513
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,025
妈的
Damn.

514
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,094
非常好
That is good.

515
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,079
非常好  我们去试试
That's very good. Here we go.

516
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,003
怎么样
How's the...

517
00:40:58,087 --> 00:40:59,087
很好
It's fine.

518
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,066
我知道我可以信任你
I know I can trust you to...

519
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:21,082
不管发生什么
Whatever happens,

520
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:25,013
你家人会得到你那份的
Your family will get your share.

521
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:30,000
谢谢
Thank you.

522
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,087
那么
So...

523
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:45,088
我等你的消息
I'll be hearing from you.

524
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:13,012
大家最近怎么样
How's everyone doing?

525
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:19,036
孩子会不会现在就出世
Is that baby ever going to come out, you think?

526
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:24,051
-我知道过了预产期了  -只是玩笑
- I know, enough already. It's... - I'm teasing.

527
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,063
要来的总会来
Everything in its time.

528
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:31,013
沃尔特  我已经看了你的扫描结果
Walt, I have your scan results.

529
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,073
有病症减退的迹象
And you're showing signs of remission.

530
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:40,082
我的天哪
My God.

531
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,038
我要解释一下
I want to clarify.

532
00:42:42,056 --> 00:42:45,035
对于症状减退的情况存在误解
There are some misconceptions about what remission signifies.

533
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,088
不是说病人完全治愈
It does not mean that the patient is cured.

534
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:50,048
说某人处于症状消退期
To classify someone as in remission,

535
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:53,035
我们必须确认肿瘤没有长大的迹象
We only need to determine that the tumor hasn't grown.

536
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:55,065
肿瘤没有生长吗  上帝啊
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

537
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,067
学术上来说
Technically speaking,

538
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:00,092
即使病人处在症状消退期
A tumor can remain the exact same size it was before

539
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:03,056
肿瘤还是有可能维持原来的大小
And the patient could still be in remission.

540
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:07,012
在沃尔特的病例  处于癌症的第三阶段
Now, in Walt's case, with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma,

541
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:10,029
我预期看到  至少
I like to see... I hope to see at least

542
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:13,026
肿瘤组织会有25%到35%的减少
A 25 to 35% reduction in tumor mass,

543
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:18,051
事实证明理疗已经对癌细胞起了作用
Something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy.

544
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:20,088
大家还在听吗
Everybody still with me?

545
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,029
结果怎么样
And how has my cancer responded?

546
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,059
沃尔特  你的肿瘤组织已经减少了80%
Walt,Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

547
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,040
-我的天哪  -等等  我真的
- My God. - Wait, I'm sorry. I'm really...

548
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:42,044
我不太懂  80%是很多吗
I'm confused. Isn't 80% a lot?

549
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,094
妈妈  当然
Mom. Yeah.

550
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:47,071
80%是很多很多
80% is a lot.

551
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:51,031
-好的  但是我  -亲爱的  你是对的
- Okay, but, I'm... - Sweetheart, you were right.

552
00:43:51,043 --> 00:43:54,023
-真的是好消息  -真的是好消息
- It's very good news. - It's very good news.

553
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,010
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

554
00:43:57,062 --> 00:44:01,000
我差点就想出去了  现在峰回路转了
Just when I try to get out, they pull me back in.

555
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:17,003
不过你的咳嗽是我们要讨论的
Now, that cough is the other thing we need to discuss.

556
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:21,018
沃尔特  根据扫描结果  你患有放射性肺炎
According to your scan, Walt, you have radiation pneumonitis.

557
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,041
没关系  这很平常
It's okay. This is fairly common.

558
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,063
看见里面那个吓人的东西了吗
See that scary-looking thing there?

559
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:31,053
那是组织炎症  是放射治疗的副反应
That's tissue inflammation. That's a reaction to your radio therapy.

560
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,069
通常不是很严重  但是会导致你那样的咳嗽
It's usually not serious, but it can produce a cough like that.

561
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:36,087
我会给你开点强的松[肾上腺素药物]
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

562
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:39,003
组织炎症
Tissue inflammation?

563
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,009
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

564
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:47,048
因为有一天  我咳出了血
Because the other day, I was coughing up some blood.

565
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,028
-什么  -可能
- What? - You probably have a tear

566
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:54,034
由于咳嗽引起了食道撕裂  那是相当严重的
In your esophagus from the coughing, and that can be very serious.

567
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:56,069
你会因为流血过多而亡的
You could rupture and bleed to death.

568
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:59,082
你今天走之前  我们会处理一下这个问题
We're going to have to deal with that before you leave here today.

569
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:02,078
等一下  什么时候的事  为什么不告诉我
Wait a minute. When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?

570
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,072
-对不起  我  -不要再隐瞒  沃尔特
- I'm sorry. I... - No more secrets, Walt.

571
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:09,034
发生那样的情况  你必须马上通知我
With something like this, you have to call me. Immediately.

572
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:13,098
从检查结果看来  我们还未完全脱离危险
Now, with these results, we're not completely out of the woods.

573
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,000
但至少我们现在多了些选择
But now at least we have some options.

574
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:18,068
最关键的就是时间
The most important of which is time.

575
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:23,014
接下来几周  我们还要进一步讨论
We'll have more to discuss in the next few weeks.

576
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:26,054
但是现在  你们一家人应该好好庆祝一下
But for now, I'd say that you folks have earned some celebrating.

577
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:31,006
太棒了
Yes.

578
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:33,074
上帝啊
Oh, my God.
