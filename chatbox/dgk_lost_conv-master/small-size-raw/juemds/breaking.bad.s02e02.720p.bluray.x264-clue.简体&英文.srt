好了  大家听着
All right, everybody.Listen up.

00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,064
屠库·塞拉曼加
Tuco Salamanca.

15
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,073
你们有些人今早没跟我们一起
For those of you not with us this morning,

16
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,033
我们抄了他的老窝
We raided his headquarters.

17
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:48,089
同时掌握了他最后的地址
Also his last known address.

18
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:52,068
还有他留给他毒枭女友的非法藏匿地
Even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend.

19
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,055
我们抓捕了一批他的马仔
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.

20
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:57,023
他则预料到了我们的出现
The big man himself smelled us coming.

21
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:58,038
所以
So...

22
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,023
认清这张脸
Study the face.

23
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,008
弄清档案
Study the file.

24
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:04,064
性趣盎然地
Get a big ol'raging hard on

25
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:07,028
准备抓到这个垃圾
At the idea of catching this piece of shit.

26
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,010
我向人力资源部的同事道歉
My apologies to the HR department.

27
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,013
应该是满怀憧憬的
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,027
在本地帮派正和摩托党抢毒品生意时
On the hit parade, 1998.

29
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:22,071
因暴打疯狗保尔森而扬名天下
Reputed to have whacked "Dog" Paulson,back when our home-grown banditos

30
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:25,079
而荣登98年的恶人排行榜
Where wrestling the crank trade away from the So Cal biker gangs.

31
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,045
此外  03年我们确信他曾捅死过一个墨西哥人
Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

32
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:33,045
依我看来  以他对待死对头的一贯做法
And for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals,

33
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:35,040
不得不说我们日思夜想的疯狂小八的失踪
I'd say he is a prime suspect

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,084
应该跟他有极大的关系
In the disappearance of our dearly-missed Krazy-8.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,001
大家尽全力抓住那个混球
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

36
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,014
我们曾经抓屠库进来查问过这件事
We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that one,

37
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,068
老样子  还是没什么确凿证据
But as usual,we couldn't make it stick.

38
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,060
这个自以为是的混蛋做事很谨慎
He runs a tight ship.Smug bastard.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,072
更糟的是  埃尔帕索说他跟大毒品集团有往来
And even worse, El Paso says he's got some kind of cartel connection.

40
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:56,017
我们都清楚这件事的后果会怎样
I know it's...We all know what's going on down there.

41
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,013
我们也不希望自己出什么岔子
We sure as hell don't want it going on up here.

42
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,015
好消息来了
Which brings us to the good news.

43
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:04,020
我们终于掌握了一些确凿的证据
We finally got some actual,honest-to-God evidence.

44
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,090
这是屠库手下  绰号"不瞌睡"
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.Street name, No Doze.

45
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,066
在垃圾场发现他的尸体  还有屠库妹夫
Found him tucked in the junkyard,along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

46
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,029
绰号怪诞
A.K.A. Gonzo.

47
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:19,029
怪诞  这个万事通  正在处理"不瞌睡"的尸体
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,was moving No Doze's body,

48
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,066
还不确定他是扔到那里还是从那里往外运
Either hiding it there or pulling it out, still not sure,

49
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:24,036
他的胳膊被砸烂了
When he got his arm crushed clean off.

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,066
想看那些照片的  我网站上有  很有趣
Anyone wanna see the photos,they're on my Web site. Hilarious.

51
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,096
总之  结果就是
Anyway. The upshot is,

52
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:35,093
我们得到一个漂亮  大号  多汁  血淋淋的指纹
We got us a nice,big, juicy, bloody fingerprint,

53
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:39,016
指纹的主人是屠库
Which belongs to senor Tuco.

54
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:43,014
我们的圣诞节提前到来了
Christmas came early to the Schrader household.

55
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:46,053
不过我们得先找到这家伙
That is, provided we find this guy.

56
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,017
在座的各位
So to all present,

57
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:51,011
你们想找到这家伙吗
I ask you, you wanna find this guy?

58

They ain't gonna find him.

65
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,052
那家伙正在墨西哥呢
Guy's in Mexico by now.

66
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:25,007
面子  格米  这都是为了面子
Appearances, Gomie.It's all about appearances.

67
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:29,057
听着  我有点私事要处理
Listen,I gotta take some personal time.

68
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:31,050
现在吗  追捕正进行着呢
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

斯凯勒昨晚打电话  说沃尔特不见了
Skyler called last night.It's Walt.He's missing.

101
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:30,085
周期性不高兴  还是因为什么事情不高兴

102
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,015
我问他出什么事  他说
When I asked him what was wrong,he said...

103
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,012
我不知道从何开始
"I don't know where to begin."

104
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,097
然后他就走出了浴室
Then he just walked out of the bathroom...

105
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,075
我当时在浴缸洗澡呢
I was in the tub. Taking a bath.

106
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:51,092
我十分钟之后出来时  他就不见了

他的钥匙  钱包  手机  就这些随身物品

109
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,046
那个电话呢
What about the phone call?

110
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,009
我正查呢
I'm looking into it.

111
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,058
什么电话
What phone call?

112
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,017
沃尔特电话响过  他拿出来
Walt's cell phone rang.He pulled it out,

113
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,031
看了一下  但是没有接
Looked at it, and didn't answer it.

114
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,091
之后一会儿他便出了浴室
But then, a short time after,he wandered out of the bathroom.

115
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,041
我是说
I mean...

116
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,070
那个会不会是
Couldn't that be...

117
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,081
重要线索  对吗
Important, right?

118
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,097
你还记得什么事情
Anything else you can think of?

119
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,079
其他事情
Anything else.

120
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:37,036
我打电话给信用卡提供商
I called the credit card providers,

121

最近没有使用记录
And there's no report of any recent activity.

122

我查问了方圆50里之内的每家医院
Let's see...I checked with every hospital within 50 miles.

123

125
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:55,084
我倒希望你们有其他什么信息
I was actually hoping that you had something else,

126
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,035
毕竟你们是专业的
Being that you're the expert.

127
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,096
-对不起  -别担心
- I'm sorry.  - No worries.

128
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:08,001
这是个很好的开端
I think this is good enough to start.

129
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,055

133
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:33,079
-然后呢  -根本就没有打过  没有记录

-他还有一部电话  -是的  我也这么想
- Second cell phone.  - Yeah. I'm thinking...

135
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,029
我明白
I understand.

136
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,002
出来
Out!

137
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,015
放开我
Get away from me!

138
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,009
安静点  疯狗
Settle down, bitch!

139
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,085
你要开枪打我吗
You gonna shoot me?

140
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,047
放马过来吧
Shoot me in here!

141
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,027
我倒是希望放点血啊
I hope I bleed like a mother, too!

142
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,093
那样的话  你就有得打扫了
That way, you have to clean it up!

143
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,090
弱智  这是你的车  我才不用收拾  出来
It's your ride, retard.I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out!

144
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:57,034
起来
Get up!

145
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,030
起来
Get up.

146
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,089
屠库  不要这样
Don't do this, Tuco.

147
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,064
没有寻人启事了
No more posters?

148
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,084
小沃尔特正在做呢
Walter Junior's making more.

149
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,066
玛丽  谢谢你
Thank you, Marie.

150
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,035
我不认为他会自杀
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

151
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,027
印象中他不是这样的人
I mean, he just doesn't strike me as the type.

152
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,006
他会回头的
He'll turn up.

153
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,064
好吧  整个头冠这件事
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

154
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:17,050
我觉得有些令人费解
I just find it bewildering that...

155
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,094
你竟然不相信
You didn't believe that...

156
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,090
现在不是时候
Not now.

157
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:59,026
兜儿里东西都掏出来
Empty your pockets.

158
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,010
我还以为你叫海森堡呢
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

159
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:33,067
沃尔特·哈特维尔·怀特
"Walter Hartwell White."

160
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:37,011
海森堡是个假名
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

161
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:41,030
交易用的名字
A business name.

162
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:57,063
我就喜欢跟有家室的人做交易
I like doing business with a family man.

163
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,063
总会有许多抵押品
There's always a lot of collateral.

164
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,017
回答我一个问题
Answer me one thing.

165
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,090
我能相信你吗
Can I trust you?

166
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:47,060
是的  当然可以
Yes, absolutely.

167
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,001
坐下
Sit down.

168
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,071
缉毒局
DEA...

169
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:14,043
今早抄了我的老窝
Hit my place of business this morning.

170
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:17,009
一百来个条子来抓我
About a hundred cops looking for me.

171
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,048
你们俩还没去谈过话吧
You two haven't been talking, right?

172
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,083
我从上到下的兄弟都被抓了
Picked up my whole crew,top to bottom.

173
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,098
除了怪诞
Everybody except Gonzo.

174
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,029
很奇怪吧
That's weird, right?

175
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,057
我是说
I mean,

176
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,015
你们不觉得很奇怪吗
Don't you think that that's weird?

177
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,012
没错  很奇怪
That's weird. Yes.

178
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:42,011
不正常
Unusual.

179
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,077
不正常
Unusual.

180
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:47,056
前两天
Last two days,

181
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,055
我电话联系不到怪诞
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

182
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,021
因为"不瞌睡"他一直很易怒
He's been acting all pouty on account of No Doze.

183
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,050
解释一下
Explain to me,

184
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,004
现在那个混蛋不知所踪
How is it my fault

185
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,068
这是我的错吗
That that little bitch did not know his place?

186
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,071
我早就料到
I saw this coming.

187
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:16,069
我可以预测未来
I can see the future, you know?

188
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:19,033
我有个天赋
It's this gift that I have

189
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,003
就是过目不忘
Deep inside my head.

190
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:26,095
昨晚我就知道他们会来抓我
I knew last night they were going to come and try and bust me.

191
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:32,072
怪诞  他给条子通风报信了
Gonzo...He went and snitched to the cops!

192
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:36,022
那个无耻的混球
That lousy son of a bitch!

193
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,012
我如兄弟一般信任他
I trusted him like a brother!

194
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,001
我待他不薄  不薄啊
I was good to him!I was good!

195
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:45,055
看到他  我非剁了他不可
I see Gonzo, I'm going to cut him,

196
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:46,071
扒了他的皮
I'm going to skin him,

197
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:50,041
把他装进袋子里天天打
And I'm going to stuff his hide for a heavy bag,

198
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,083
每打他一次
And every time I hit him,

199
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,073
我就吸取一次教训
It's going to be like a lesson to myself!

200
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:58,097
永远不要相信你爱的人
You never,never trust the people that you love!

201
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:09,046
你打算干掉怪诞
So, you plan to ice Gonzo,

202
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,035
在不久的将来
Like, future tense?

203
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,027
你在说
You're saying...

204
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,028
你在说
You're saying that...

205
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,006
目前怪诞
Gonzo is currently...

206
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:25,052
据你所知  他是警方的线人
Operating as a police informant,as far as you know?

207
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,057
很遗憾听到这个消息
I'm very sorry to hear that.

208
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,054
太令人失望了
That's disappointing.

209
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:39,032
-要是我  我也会废了他的  -闭嘴
- I'd waste him, too, yo.  - Shut up.

210
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,065
条子正满世界找我呢
They're out there looking for me right now.

211
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,094
他们动用了警用直升机还有特别行动小组
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

212
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:48,030
我得来点刺激的
I need to get high.

213
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,021
好好的爽一下
I need to get good and high.

214
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:59,042
这是什么玩意  闻起来想猪头冻
What's with this gak? It smells like headcheese.

215
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:02,077
这是猛料
It's killer.

216
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,025
是的  说真的
Yeah, seriously.

217
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,050
昨晚我考虑了一下
So, I was thinking last night.

218
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,071
想出了这个绝妙的主意
I came up with this great idea.

219
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,086
墨西哥
Mexico.

220
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,074
墨西哥
Mexico?

221
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:23,033
我们消失在茫茫的丛林之中
We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

222
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,038
给你们配备一个超级实验室
We'll set you up in a superlab.

223
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,093
一刻不停地制毒
We'll do nothing but cook 24-7.

224
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:29,092
联邦警察可管不了我们
And no federales are going to mess with us,

225
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:31,084
因为那里有我的人
Because I got my people there.

226
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,082
关系
Connections.

227
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,054
我们将会
We're going to make

228
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:38,027
大赚特赚  海森堡
beaucoup bucks, Heisenberg.

229
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:44,027
我有妻子和家庭
I have a wife and family.

230
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,025
那又怎样  再找一个
So what? You'll get another one.

231
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,008
我不想让你误会
I don't want you to take this the wrong way,

232
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,000
但是我不能
But I can't just...

233
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,012
就这么毁了我的家庭
Uproot my life like that.

234
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,053
是的 我也不能
Yeah, man.I mean, me, neither.

235
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:01,012
谁问你话了吗
Who's talking to you?

236
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:06,099
你需要我
You need me, man,

237
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,009
你手里那个猛料可是我做出来的
'cause I cooked that scante in your hands.

238
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,090
老实跟你说吧
I'll tell you something, yo.

239
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:19,054
你肯定没尝过这种货
You never tried nothing like it.

240
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:22,065
无论气味如何
Stink or no stink,

241
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:24,017
一口下去
One bump,

242
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,067
接下来的几天你都飘飘欲仙
You'll be flying high for days.

243
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:32,036
这是我俩研制出来的新品
It's a new product him and I been working up.

244
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,061
嗑的时候悠着点
Careful when you hit it.

245
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:38,026
劲儿上来跟开12-guage一样爽[12-guage 一种12毫米重机枪]
It kicks like a 12-gauge when it comes on.

246
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:43,035
这可是独家配料
It's got a secret ingredient.

247
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,009
什么独家配料
What secret ingredient?

00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:50,043
辣椒粉
Chili powder.

249
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,059
我讨厌辣椒粉
I hate chili powder.

250
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:06,069
这个蓝精灵  这才值钱
This blue magic, this is money.

251
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,005
海森堡  你继续制这个
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

252
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,050
我们就用这个改写历史吧
We're going to rewrite history with this.

253
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:23,065
好了
All right!

254
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:26,036
是时候干掉这个小鬼头了  省的心烦
Time to clean the menudo out from between your ears!

255
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,002
不  我需要他  屠库
No, I need him, Tuco.

256
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,063
我非常非常需要他
I need him very, very badly.

257
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:36,046
他是我的搭档
He's my partner.

258
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,051
如果他去不了
And if he doesn't go,

259
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,004
我也不去
I don't go.

260
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,070
告诉你吧  我堂兄正开车赶过来
I'll tell you this,my cousins are driving up here

261
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,010
把我们偷渡过去
Right now to smuggle us back down,

262
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,071
他们天黑前就到
And they're going to be here by sunset,

263
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:51,007
要么我们一起走
And you're going to be on that truck,

264
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,050
要么你就等死吧
Or you're going to be dead!

265
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:56,066
你呢
And you...

266
00:23:58,046 --> 00:24:00,053
你最好祈祷车上还有空座
You better hope they got room in the trunk.

267
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,024
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

268
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:21,010
路易斯要带我去火车站
Louis is taking me to the train station.

269
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,049
我们去贴这些东西
We'll put these on.

270
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,073
不用了  亲爱的  我去贴吧
No, no, honey.No, I'll do it.

271
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,069
他想要帮忙  就让他帮忙吧
He wants to help, let him help.

272
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:30,013
你有多久没睡觉了
I mean, how long has it been since you've slept?

273
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,016
她说的没错  斯凯  你去躺一下吧
Yeah, she's right,Sky.Why don't you lay down a while?

274
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:38,011
况且你还怀着小宝宝呢
For Christ sake,you got a bun in the oven.

275
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,092
有事你就打我的手机
I got my cell if you need me.

276
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,030
再见  宝贝  待会儿见
Bye, sweetie.I'll see you later.

277
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,077
好的  再见
All right. Bye.

278
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,088
事实上
Actually,

279
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:56,028
目前为止还没有找到他
I think the very fact they haven't found him yet...

280
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,053
或许是个好消息
bodes well.

281
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:01,028
我是说  如果他
Well, I mean, if he...

282
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:02,091
你知道
You know.

283
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,095
肯定会有人发现些什么的
Somebody would've smelled something by now.

284
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,043
一定还有些事情
There's got to be something,

285
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,081
一些我们没有注意到的细节
Some detail that we haven't picked up on.

286
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,009
第二部手机有什么线索
What about the second cell phone?

287
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,012
天呐
Aw, Jesus.

288
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:21,005
怎么了  任何线索都不能放过的  汉克
What? We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank.

289
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:24,062
好了  你们在说什么
Okay. What are you talking about?

290
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,091
沃尔特失踪前接到的那个电话
The call you said Walt got before he disappeared,

291
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:35,046
电话公司并没有任何记录
There's no record of it with the phone company.

292
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,026
没有来电  也没有中断电话  什么都没有
No incoming,no dropped calls, nothing.

293
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:40,030
但是他电话响了  我听到了
But his phone rang.I heard it.

294
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:44,031
没错  问题就在这里
Well, all right.Well, then, if that's the case,

295
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,088
他肯定还有部手机
He must have a second phone.

296
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,082
为什么  他要两个手机干什么 
Why? What sense would there be in that?

297
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:54,044
好吧  我不想跟你争执
All right. Okay. I'm not here to argue with you.

298
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:00,016
不  汉克  你不能就提一下那个神秘电话
No, Hank. You can't just bring up "secret cell phone"

299
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,027
那意味着什么
What does it mean?

300
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,022
我不知道  斯凯  你想要我说什么
I don't know, Sky. What do you want me to say?

301
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,069
说明沃尔特有自己的秘密
It means Walt has a secret.

302
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,099
人人都有秘密  或大或小
Everyone's got one from somebody,big or little.

303
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,096
人人
"Everyone."

304
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:23,015
他得癌症的消息还瞒了你很久呢
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

305
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,088
好吧  假设他还有一部手机
Then, let's assume there'a second cell phone.

306
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,025
怎么了  说明他有外遇了吗
So, what? Is he having an affair?

307
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:34,022
沃尔特  拜托
Walt? Please.

308
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,075
是不是他又吸大麻了
What about the marijuana?

309
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:43,067
他已经不吸那个了
He's not on pot anymore.

310
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,070
谁说的  他自己吗
Says who? Him?

311
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,059
化疗跟大麻如影相随
Chemotherapy and marijuana go together

312
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:52,040
就像苹果派和雪弗莱一样
Like apple pie and Chevrolet.

313
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,089
或许
Maybe...

314
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:57,061
他又上瘾了
He's addicted to the pot,

315
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,089
欠了毒贩子一大笔钱
And he owes his drug dealer a lot of money.

316
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:03,016
他不会这样的
You don't get hooked on pot like that.

317
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,024
你连他有两部电话都不知道
You didn't even know he had a second cell phone.

318
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:11,037
汉克  你得去问问那个毒贩子
Hank,you have to question this drug dealer person.

319
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:13,008
他或许知道些情况
He may know something.

320
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:21,043
告诉你吧  那可是我们的救命稻草
Well, I'm telling you,we're grasping at straws here.

321
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:25,074
那就抓稳了
Then grasp.

322
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,028
打扰一下  夫人
Excuse me. Ma'am?

323
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:41,098
我找杰西  他在吗
Hi. I'm looking for Jesse.He around?

324
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,040
不在
No. I'm afraid not.

325
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,020
-什么事  -抱歉  我是汉克·施拉德
- Why?  - I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

326
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,050
我想跟杰西谈谈
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse

327
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,096
关于我姐夫沃尔特·怀特的事
About my brother-in-law, Walter White.

328
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,079
他是你儿子高中的化学老师
He taught your son chemistry in high school.

329
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:58,078
怀特先生啊  是的  我记得他
Oh, Mr. White.Yes, I remember him.

330
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:00,090
那是很久之前的事了
That was a long time ago.

331
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,048
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

332
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:03,051
我认为他和杰西
It's my understanding that he and Jesse,

333
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,082
一直都有联系
They've stayed in touch.

334
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:07,073
真的吗
Really?

335
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:14,067
怀特先生一定看中了杰西的一些潜质
Mr. White must've seen some potential in Jesse.

336
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,091
他一直试图激励他
He really tried to motivate him.

337
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:19,085
他是为数不多关心杰西的老师之一
He was one of the few teachers who cared.

338
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:22,022
是的  沃尔特就是那样  他是个好人
Yeah, Walt's that way.He's a good man.

339
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:24,049
很遗憾他得了这个病
I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.

340
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,077
请代我向他致以最美好的祝愿
Please pass along our best wishes.

341
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:29,047
等他回来之后  我一定会的
I certainly will,as soon as he turns up.

342
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:31,046
事实上  他失踪了
He's missing, actually.

343
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,027
像是出走或者
Just kind of walked off or...

344
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,047
总之  所以我才四处打听
Anyway, which is why I'm going around

345
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:39,092
认识他的人  虽然希望不大
Trying to think of anyone who knows him, even slightly.

346
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,066
太糟了
That's terrible.

347
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,089
我们能帮上什么忙吗
Anything we can do to help?

348
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,029
能帮我联系到你儿子吗
Well, if you could put me in touch with your son.

349
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,041
我说过了  实在没有什么线索了
Like I said, we're kind of desperate for leads.

350
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,030
我给杰西打电话  他都没接
Jesse's not answering either phone number I have for him,

351
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,022
也没有人见到他在家里
And no one seems to be home at his house.

352
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,067
你凭什么认为我儿子和怀特先生有联系
And why do you think my son and Mr. White would be in touch?

353
00:29:00,077 --> 00:29:03,081
我也不确定  只是
I don't necessarily. I just...

354
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:06,019
-你是警察吗  -不  女士  我不是
- Are you with the police?  - No, ma'am. Not at all.

355
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:12,092
我是缉毒局的
I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

356
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:16,088
天呐  我儿子惹什么事了吗
Oh, my God.Is my son in trouble?

357
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,031
我不认为这样
I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.

358
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:21,013
我需要请个律师吗
Do I need to get a lawyer?

359
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:24,074
你对这件事有点支支吾吾的
You know, you don't seem very forthright about this,

360
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:26,094
过来就问这问那的
Coming here and asking questions about my son...

361
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,022
平克曼女士  我向你发誓
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,

362
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:29,080
我不是代表官方来这里
I'm not here on official capacity.

363
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:33,046
我不在乎你儿子是否做了什么坏事
I do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong.

364
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,091
我只想找到我姐夫
I just want to find my brother-in-law.

365
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,091
他妻子担心死了
His wife is worried sick,

366
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:40,028
而且正怀着身孕
And she's got a baby on the way.

367
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,020
抱歉  我很想帮你
I'm sorry.I would like to help you,

368
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,089
但我有一个多月没见着我儿子了
But I have not seen my son in over a month.

369
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,038
最近估计他也不会出现了
I don't expect to see him anytime soon.

370
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:55,041
感谢您的配合
Well, thanks for your time.

371
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,003
还有一个问题
If you could tell me one more thing.

372
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:05,003
据你所知
Is Jesse still driving the, uh,

373
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,033
杰西的车子是不是89款的雪佛兰蒙特卡洛
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo,as far as you know?

374
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,089
如果他能花一半时间和精力在学习上
If he had spent half as much time and money on his education

375
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:17,012
而不是捣鼓那辆无聊的弹簧车
As he has on that ridiculous bouncing car...

376
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,081
低底盘的
Lowrider, huh?

377
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:26,055
还没消息呢  听着  帮我查一下
Nah, nothing yet. Listen,do me a solid and check out a...

378
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,091
一款89款雪佛兰蒙特卡洛
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo

379
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:32,042
注册在杰西·平克曼名下
Registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

380
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:36,025
尤其注意一下有没有装防盗追踪系统
Specifically? I want to know if the car's got LoJack.

381
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,008
是那种强力型低底盘的车子
It's one of those jackoff lowriders.

382
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,049
很有可能装了
It's got a good shot that there is.

383
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,004
如果有的话  立马帮我进行追踪  谢啦
If so, can you go ahead and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

384
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:12,032
辣椒粉
Chili powder.

385
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:16,023
我难道没告诉你那有多么低能吗
Did I not already tell you how moronic that was?

386
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,051
无所谓了
Whatever, man.

387
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,044
至少我尝试了
At least I tried something.

388
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,000
差点就成功了
It almost worked, too.

389
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:24,058
你还落下了我的枪呢
How's about you leaving my gun?

390
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:29,002
先是偷走了  然后又落在自己屋子里
First you boost it, then you leave it in your house.

391
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:30,014
我的枪
My gun.

392
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,049
我怎么会知道
How was I supposed to know

393
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:37,036
你要带着屠库来我这里
You were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

394
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:40,041
至少他要留你的活口
Well, at least he wants you alive.

395
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,053
我不明白了
Hey, I don't get it.

396
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:19,030
屠库没有杀死怪诞  那是谁干的呢
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,then who did?

397
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:21,027
不知道
I don't know.

398
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:23,091
不知道
I don't know.

399
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,056
这个很重要吗
Does it really matter?

400
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:30,016
如果他发现怪诞已经死了
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead

401
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,005
并且他不是警方的线人
And not a police informant,

402
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,067
他会怪罪谁呢
Who does he automatically blame?

403
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,056
我们
Us.

404
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,071
我们得计划一下
We need a plan.

405
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,006
好好想想
Think, think.

406
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,012
我们偷袭他吧
Let's just bum-rush him, man.

407
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:48,077
你拿东西砸他的脑袋
You know, you crack him over the head with something,

408
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:50,015
我去抢枪
And I'll go for his gun.

409
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,000
拿东西砸他脑袋
"Crack him over the head with something"?

410
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,048
反正你得了癌症
And you got the C-bomb, man.

411
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,031
早晚都是死
You're as good as checked out already.

412
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:09,023
你应该像个烈士一样
You should be, like,all sacrificial,

413
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:11,016
扑向手榴弹
Jumping on a grenade, yo.

414
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,041
就是说我的命不再重要了
Oh, so my life is not the priority here,

415
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,069
因为我离死不远了
Because I'm going to be dead soon anyway.

416
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:21,065
你是这么想的吗
That's your point?

417
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:54,026
我们得让他尝尝这个
We got to get him to take this.

418
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:57,073
他不喜欢辣椒粉的味道
He don't much like the taste of chili P.

419
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,044
这点他已经明确说明了
That much has been established.

420
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,014
除非你能说服他塞进屁眼里
So unless you can convince him to booty bump...

421
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:09,019
吃吧
Eat.

422
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:10,093
还有很长的路要赶呢
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

423
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,021
去坐下吧
Go and sit.

424
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:32,073
你看起来有点虚  海森堡
You're looking a little weak, Heisenberg.

425
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:35,008
我可不想还没到那儿你就挂了
I don't want you to go belly up before we get there.

426
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:16,089
别着急  迪奥
Take it easy, Tio.

427
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,088
我先吃  然后喂你
I will feed you. I eat first.

428
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,024
说好了的
That's the deal.

429
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,097
怎么了
What?

430
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,004
我明白了  明白了
I get it, I get it, I get it.

431
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,063
你这个贪婪的老混球
You greedy old bastard.

432
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:47,009
告诉你吧  海森堡
I tell you, Heisenberg...

433
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,021
老人
Old people.

434
00:35:52,031 --> 00:35:53,027
你喂养他们
You feed them, huh?

435
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,005
即使把他们放在乡下的粮仓里
You put them in a really nice crib in the country,

436
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:59,071
他们还是会从你盘子里偷吃的
And yet they gotta steal the food off your plate.

437
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,002
你最好都吃完了
You better eat every bite of that.

438
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,011
你搞什么
What did you do that for?

439
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,022
天呐
God!

440
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:18,029
看啊
Look. Lookit.

441
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:20,027
一点都不剩
There's nothing left.

442
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,001
怎么
What?

443
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,091
你想怎样
What do you want?

444
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,008
别告诉我你饿了
Don't even tell me that you're hungry.

445
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,032
别给我来这一套
Don't go there.

446
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,073
你在向他们示威吗  迪奥
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

447
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,058
你不喜欢他们吗
What, you don't like them?

448
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:28,023
一声响  是肯定的回答
One ding. That means "yes."

449
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,008
迪奥不喜欢你们
Tio don't like you.

450
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:36,076
迪奥  你为什么不喜欢他们
Why don't you like them, Tio?

451
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:42,014
你不信任他们
You don't trust them?

452
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:51,036
为什么不信任他们呢  迪奥
Why don't you trust them, Tio?

453
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,030
屠库  拜托  我是说  他

是不是他们换走了你的美女
