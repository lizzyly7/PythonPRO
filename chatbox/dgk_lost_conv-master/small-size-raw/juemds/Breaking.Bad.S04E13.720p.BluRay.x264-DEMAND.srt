1
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,820
你对古斯说了什么
What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,920
他察觉到我们的行动了  没错
Because he's on to us. Yeah.

3
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,570
我什么都没说  你说察觉是什么意思
I didn't say Jack. What do you mean he's on to us?

4
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,530
他当时正朝着车走去  突然就停住了
He's walking to his car. Then suddenly he isn't.

5
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,770
莫非他有什么第六感不成
What, does he have some kind of sixth sense?

6
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,470
老天  你对他说了什么
Jesus, what did you say to him?

7
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,200
现在能让我问个问题吗
Could I ask my own question right now, at this point?

8
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,060
你是不是把炸弹带进医院来了
Did you just bring a bomb into a hospital?

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,210
怎么  我怎么能把它留在车底下
What? Was I supposed to leave it on his car?

10
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,480
那你就能把它带进医院  是吗
What, you're supposed to bring it into a hospital?

11
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,900
我的天
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,220
听着
Look.

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,959
我们在哪能找到古斯  说个地点
Where can we find Gus? Name a place.

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,270
说一个能让他出其不意
Name me one place where I could surprise him,

15
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,870
让他看不见我去找他的地方
where he won't see me coming.

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,650
因为他家  洗衣店
Because his house, the laundry,

17
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,370
餐馆  工厂化农场
the restaurant, the factory farm,

18
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,070
都布满了摄像头
they're all wired with cameras.

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,200
一个地方就行
One place.

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,490
好好想想
Think.

21
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,060
杰西  好好想想
Jesse, think.

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,590
在哪里  会是哪
Where is it? Where?

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
因为如果你想不出来
Because if you can't tell me,

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,110
我们就死定了
we are dead.

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,770
杰西
Jesse.

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,000
我不  我不知道
I don't-- I don't know.

27
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,630
也许...
Well, maybe--

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,750
打扰了  是杰西・平克曼吗
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,850
是我
Uh, yeah.

30
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,930
你好  我是克莱桥警探
Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,220
这位是穆恩警探  阿尔布开克警署的
This is Detective Munn, Albuquerque Police.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,550
我们想知道能否耽误你一点时间
We were wondering if we could have a few minutes of your time,

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,300
找个地方聊一聊
maybe go someplace and talk.

34
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,760
聊什么
About what?

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,190
抱歉  先生  您是哪位
Sorry, sir, I didn't catch your name.

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,560
聊什么
About what?

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,170
有关布洛克・坎蒂略
It concerns Brock Cantillo

38
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,770
以及你对他母亲说的一番话
and a statement you made to his mother.

39
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,440
您何不跟我们走一趟
How about you come with us?

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,970
我们只是想了解些情况  不必紧张
We just want to clear a few things up. No big deal.

41
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:15,710
第四季 第十三集 (本季完结)
S04E13(Finale): Face Off

42
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,290
我被捕了吗
Am I under arrest?

43
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,670
不  你没被捕
No, you're not under arrest.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,970
我们就是聊聊
We're just talking.

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,770
那如果我聊烦了
So if I get tired of talking,

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,040
想要起身走人呢
want to get up and leave--

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
我们希望你不要这样
We'd prefer you didn't.

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,520
你们希望
You'd prefer, so--

49
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,620
杰西  你为什么告诉布洛克的妈妈
Jesse, why did you tell Brock's mom

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,630
那个孩子是被下毒了
that the boy had been poisoned?

51
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,290
我想这件事是...
Look, I think this has been, you know,

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
你们怎么说来着
uh, what do you call it?

53
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,660
是夸大其辞  因为我的原话是
Overblown, because all I basically said was

54
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,590
"医生有没有想过  布洛克可能是中毒"
"Have the doctors thought maybe Brock got poisoned?"

55
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,810
基于全方面考虑的话
You know, in a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

56
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,140
当然  我肯定他们很感激
Yeah. No, I'm sure they appreciated that,

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,220
你帮他们脱离困境
you helping them out like that,

58
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,180
尤其是如此明确地指出了病因
especially with how specific you were and all.

59
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,330
蓖麻毒素  真厉害
Ricin. Wow.

60
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,650
是啊  蓖麻毒素  这可非同一般
Yeah, ricin-- that's definitely a big one.

61
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,930
可不常见
You don't see that every day,

62
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,590
所以当医生们听说这个
so when doctors, they hear that,

63
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,910
他们高度重视起来
they take it very seriously,

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,560
我们也是
as do we,

65
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,190
联调局的人也是
as does the FBI.

66
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,840
好吧
Okay.

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,420
不过挺好  你那样尽全力救助
And nice, you trying to help out like that and all,

68
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,590
很具职业素养
you know, professional courtesy,

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,760
分享你的专业知识
sharing your expertise.

70
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,010
我没什么专业的
I ain't go no expertise.

71
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,290
好吗  我只是...
All right? I just, you know--

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,860
你只是恰好猜到这种罕见的毒素
You just happen to guess this one rare poison

73
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,350
会是将这小男孩送进医院的病因
might be the thing that put this little boy in the hospital.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,340
恭喜你  因为他的医生
And congratulations, because his doctors,

75
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,700
开始认为你可能是对的
they're beginning to think that you might just be right.

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,010
那你为什么猜蓖麻毒素
So why ricin?

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,580
杰西  你怎么会想到那个
Jesse, how did you come up with that?

78
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,400
天  我想我是
Man, I think I've--

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,910
我不清楚  一定是在《豪斯医生》
I don't know. I must've saw it

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,870
之类的电视上看到的
on House or something.

81
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,010
你知道的  像《豪斯医生》
Yeah, you know, like House

82
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,420
或者探索频道
or the Discovery Channel.

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,600
有时候你的大脑就会产生这些联想
Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,550
-会吗  -我的会
- Does it? - Mine does.

85
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,270
这真有趣
That's interesting.

86
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,310
我要回去了
Look, I've got to get back.

87
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,840
但我们还没聊完呢
But we're still talking.

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,340
那我没被捕  但也不能离开
So I'm not under arrest, but I can't leave.

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,200
那好
So, then,

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,700
我想我该叫我的律师  对吧
I guess I should call my lawyer. Right?

91
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,420
我们这只是随便聊聊  杰西
We're just having a simple conversation, Jess.

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,990
继续聊聊不好吗  不要那么严肃
Why can't we keep talking, keep it light?

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,420
兄弟你可知道  凡事一遇到律师
Man, you know how it is when the lawyers get to it.

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,090
立刻就操蛋了
Suddenly everything's a big pissing match,

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,360
一贯如此
like, every time.

96
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,660
对抗性太强
Adversarial.

97
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,090
对抗性太强  然后我们就得控告你  等等
Adversarial. Then we gotta book you, blah, blah. Right?

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,590
杰西  你该知道自己是有案底的
I mean, you know. You've been around the block, Jesse.

99
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,320
你可不是什么好苗苗
You're no boy scout.

100
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,220
索尔・古德曼
Saul Goodman.

101
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,390
我律师
That's my guy.

102
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,220
是我自己打电话  还是你们打
So do I gotta call him, or do you?

103
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,720
你这是搞什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,130
我要找索尔  现在就要见他
I need Saul. I need him right now.

105
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,840
那你就破门而入  破门而入
So you break into the place. You just break in!

106
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,770
-我的老天  -可你一直在
- Jesus! - You're here, by the way.

107
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,100
要是你能接个电话  应下门
If you'd had bothered answering the phone or the door,

108
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,820
或许我就不用...  算了
maybe I wouldn't have-- Forget it.

109
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,510
他在不在
Is he here?

110
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,700
你逗我玩呢
Is that a serious question?

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,870
他怎么会在这里
Why would he be here?

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,810
你知道他在哪儿  是不是
You know where he is, don't you?

113
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,900
我需要电话号码
I need a number.

114
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,010
听我给你说
Look. Let me explain something to you.

115
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,340
-我的搭档和我...  -有危险
- My partner and I... - Are in danger?

116
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,930
你们捅了多大的娄子
Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.

117
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,280
你以为他为什么不在
Why do you think he's not here?

118
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,610
再说这有什么稀奇的
And how's that news, exactly,

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,430
你们两个做了蠢事
the two of you being in danger,

120
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,330
又遇到危险
after doing something idiotic?

121
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,120
谁给你权力砸破我的门
And what gives you the right to break down my door?

122
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,920
听我说  我只需要电话号码  没别的
Look, I just need a number. Okay? That's all.

123
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,060
你真是烦死人了
You are such a pain in my ass.

124
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,120
你知道吗
You know that?

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,810
因为你的缘故  我要丢了工作
You're the reason I've got to go on unemployment

126
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,630
天知道什么时候能再找到
for God knows how long.

127
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,840
我本来盼着
I was at least looking forward

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,500
再有半小时就可以走人了
to getting out of here in the next half hour,

129
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,470
可是没门啊
but no!

130
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,410
现在我得在这等上一整天
Now I've got to wait around all day

131
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,350
找工人来修好这门
for a plate glass guy to come and fix this door,

132
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,430
谁来掏钱
and who pays for this?

133
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,230
好吧  这么着
Okay, you know what?

134
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,710
我赔你的  我来赔
Here, look. I'm giving you everything,

135
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,000
全算我的  成不
all of it, okay?

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,990
一  二  三
There's one, two, three--

137
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,520
这至少是一千七百块
Look, there's got to be at least $1,700 there, okay?

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,140
修门足够还有富余
That will more than cover the cost of the door.

139
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,990
我道歉
Now, I apologize profusely.

140
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,230
求你了  告诉我号码
Please, the phone number.

141
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,540
这样的门可不是一千七百块就能修好的
Door like this is going to cost way more than 1,700.

142
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,820
什么  不就是玻璃门吗  怎么会
What? For a plate of glass? No.

143
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,360
当然会  一定不止
Oh, yeah, I bet it does.

144
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,340
要我说  修这门至少得
I bet you it winds up costing...

145
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,510
两万
20,000.

146
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,380
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

147
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,990
修一扇破玻璃门
Who the hell is going to charge $20,000

148
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,730
谁会要价两万
for a plate glass door?

149
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,220
哪有正经装修商...
There's no reputable vendor w--

150
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,160
我看现在得两万五了
Now I'm thinking 25.

151
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,340
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

152
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
对  新墨西哥州  阿尔布开克
Yes, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,450
他怎么样了
So how's he doing?

184
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,720
你们至少得给个话
Yo, you could at least say,

185
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,060
别摆这副装蒜的死样子
instead of being a couple of dicks about it.

186
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,740
杰西  如果你对那小男孩还有一点点关心
Jesse, if you cared at all about that little boy,

再说一次
Tell us again.

191
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,510
干什么  以为我是祥林嫂吗
What are you, like-- like broken records?

192
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,500
我不过是想帮忙
I was trying to be helpful.

193
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,330
没别的了
End of story.

194
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,550
看来我们得等验毒报告出来了
Guess we'll have to wait and see what the tox screen says.

195
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,020
看看  还挺舒服的嘛
Oh, look at this. Isn't this cozy?

196
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,920
你和他们说了什么
What did you tell them?

197
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,900
我和他们说他们只是一群混蛋
I told them they were a couple of dicks.

198
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,660
真是文采飞扬
He's a wordsmith.

199
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,540

表现出你们对法律的尊敬
Make like you respect the rule of law.

204
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,090
再见[法语]  再见[德语]
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,

205
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,930
再见[西语]  快滚吧

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,290
拜拜
Buh-bye.

207
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,960
就是这样  别落东西  跟上你搭档
That's it. Pick it up. Follow your partner.

208
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,250
限你两秒之内
And one, two...

209
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,760
谢谢合作
Thank you.

210
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,590
天呐  你们两个
Christ. You two.

211
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,899
要是我的菊花不幸生了息肉
All I can say is if I ever get anal polyps,

212
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,650
至少我知道该给他们取什么名字
I'll know what to name them.

213
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,010
你来带我出去的
You gonna get me out of here?

214
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,340
让我想想  不是的
Ah. Hm. No.

215
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,220
就算行也不让你出去
Not even if I could.

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,420
听着  联邦调查局会介入调查
You know, the FBI's going to show up on this ricin thing,

217
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,830
而在这段时间内  你将会被关在这
and then you're in it for the duration.

218
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,630
你得知道  你在这儿可安全着呢
You know, you're a lot safer in here.

219
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,150
那帮人刚还在你搭档家里守株待兔
They just tried to get your partner in his own home.

220
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,840
天呐
Jesus.

221
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,800
他没事吧
Is he okay?

222
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,910
暂时没事
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.

223
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,509
我们所剩的时日不多了
We're all on the clock here,

224
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,909
这真得感谢你们
and thanks for that, by the way.

225
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,420
你们想在老虎头上扑苍蝇
You two want to stick your wangs in a hornet's nest,

226
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,750
我管不了你们
it's a free country,

227
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,260
为什么总是我来给你们擦屁股
but how come I always gotta get sloppy seconds, huh?

228
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,110
而你们为我付出了什么
Have you got anything for me?

229
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,250
别和我说这是义务劳动
I mean, tell me I didn't poke my head up for nothing.

230
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,990
的确
Yeah.

231
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,190
我一直在考虑
I've been thinking.

232
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,260
结果呢
And?

233
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,020
卡萨・特拉奇拉
Casa Tranquila.

234
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,520
卡萨・特拉奇拉是什么地方
What's Casa Tranquila?

235
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,060
是在帕西奥・德拉诺特的一家敬老院
It's an old folks' home off Paseo Del Norte.

236
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,060
那孩子告诉我福林把他带到那里
Our boy tells me Fring took him there

237
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,560
拜访了一位病人
to visit one of the patients,

238
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,490
平克曼说这人你一定记得
someone Pinkman says you'll definitely remember--

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,890
迪奥・塞拉曼加
Tio Salamanca.

240
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,520
坐轮椅的一个老头
Old guy in a wheelchair.

241
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,220
不会说话
Um, doesn't talk,

242
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,060
只能按铃
rings a bell.

243
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,120
我不是说  你想到了吗
I don't mean "Does that ring a bell?"

244
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,800
我的意思是  那人确实只能
I mean, the guy actually has to

245
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,390
-按铃来交流  -我知道  我记得
- ring a bell. - I-- Yes, I know. I remember.

246
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,750
那又怎样  每个特定时期
So what, once every blue moon,

247
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,880
古斯都要去拜访一位前帮派成员
Gus goes and visits an old cartel associate.

248
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,210
那又能怎样
That-- That doesn't help me.

249
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,540
我可没法在病房里躲个半年
I can't very well hide out in a nursing home for six months,

250
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,380
抱着侥幸的心理希望他会来
hoping, on the off chance, that he comes back.

251
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,660
他们貌似并不是朋友
It's not even like they're friends.

252
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,920
平克曼说看上去他在折磨这老头
Pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy.

253
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,290
此话怎讲
What does that mean?

254
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,320
他告诉他说他的最后一个家人已经死了
He told him the last of his family was dead.

255
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,090
他似乎很幸灾乐祸
He seemed to enjoy telling him.

256
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,820
后来  平克曼问他为什么
Afterward, Pinkman asked him about it.

257
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,960
古斯说这个叫迪奥的人
All Gus would say was that this Tio character

258
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,560
曾经杀过一个和他关系很好的人
once murdered someone close to him.

259
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,490
等等  迪奥杀了一个和他关系很好的人
Wait. Tio murdered someone close to Gus?

260
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,890
我知道这并不是什么有利消息
I know it sound not particularly fruitful,

261
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,560
可抱歉  我只有这些信息
but, sorry, that's all I got.

262
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,420
他们是敌人
They're enemies,

263
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,660
不是朋友
not friends.

264
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,860
你在这游戏里的下一个数字将是

那就是在B行里的第3个

270
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,320
O-74就在你卡片的另一端
That's O-74 on the other side of your card.

271
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,960
现在我们得到了我们下一个幸运数字  B-7

在I行  2-1

我知道你鄙视我
I know you despise me,

275
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,060
我也知道你想看我死掉
and I know how badly you want to see me dead,

276
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,790
可我愿意打赌
but I'm willing to bet

277
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,320
有一个人你肯定更加痛恨
that I know a man whom you hate even more.

278
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,210
我提供你一个复仇的机会
I am offering you an opportunity for revenge.

279
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,950
4-8那一块  就是美国大陆

280
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,210
不包括阿拉斯加州和夏威夷

Honey, "Dea" Ain't a word.

323
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,860
拜托别折腾我了
Help me out here.

324
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,810
儿子  什么事
Hey, son, what's up?

325
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,460
你到底什么时候过来啊
When exactly are you getting here?

326
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,190
我尽快
Uh, just as soon as I can.

327
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,120
老爸  这可不是闹着玩儿的
Look, this is a serious situation,

328
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,960
你怎么那么不当回事呢
and it's like you're not taking it seriously

329
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,320
把电话给我  我跟他说
Give me the phone. Let me talk to him.

330
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,610
儿子  我很当回事
No, son, I am taking it very seriously.

331
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,860
沃尔特  赶紧把电话给我
Just give it to me, Walt.

332
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,880
我很担心你姑父汉克的安危
I'm very concerned about your Uncle Hank and his safety,

333
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,740
不过不管是谁想害他
but whomever is making these threats against him,

334
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,990
我都向你保证和我绝无牵连
I can assure you there's absolutely no interest in me.

335
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,410
没人要算计我
I'm not on-- on anyone's radar,

336
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,960
-加上你和你妈  -给我  沃尔特
- and besides your mother and I. - Give it to me. Walter?

337
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,670
听到你儿子说什么了吗
Did you hear what he said?

338
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,010
赶紧过来
Get over here.

339
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,430
别找借口
No more excuses.

340
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,850
玛丽  我会尽快过去
Marie, I will be there just as soon as I can.

341
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,130
-我保证  -先别挂
- I promise. - Hold on.

342
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,510
你不一起劝劝他吗
You want to weigh in here?

343
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,340
没准儿你还能劝得住
Maybe you could talk some sense into him.

344
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,510
玛丽  他该来时自然会来  所以...
Marie, he'll get here when he gets here, so just...

345
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,010
好好卖你的空气清新剂去吧
Well, I hope you sell plenty of air fresheners.

346
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,680
最好能成为销售大王
I hope you just have a banner day over there.

347
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,910
沃尔特  你听着
Okay, Walt?

348
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,310
这里的事用不着你管
Don't worry about a thing here.

349
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,750
挂了
Goodbye.

350
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,170
也谢谢您
And thank you

351
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,260
"鼎力"支持
for all of your help.

352
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
有情况吗
Anything?

353
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,950
-大家好  -你好  史蒂夫
- Hi, everyone. - Hi, Steve.

354
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,140
各位还好吧
How's everybody holding up?

355
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,230
格米  说曹操曹操就到
Hey, Gomie, just the man I want to see.

356
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,310
过来看看这个
Come here, look at this.

357
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,510
天呐  洗衣店的事就此打住
Jesus, enough with the laundry.

358
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,210
别  别  听我说完
No, no, no, hear me out.

359
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,340
看这配电柜  要是我没弄错
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly,

360
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,580
就是7200安的动力
is a 7,200-amp service.

361
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,710
这里就装了俩
This place has two of them.

362
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,840
对吧
All right?

363
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,910
老兄  这电量可大了
That's a whole lot of juice, brother.

364
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,810
这规模的洗衣店一般用一半也就够了
Laundry this size typically has maybe half that, okay?

365
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,540
那多出那个是干什么使的
So what's with the extra panel?

366
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,040
你当你是托马斯・爱迪生啊
What are you, Thomas Edison now?

367
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,780
不  我问了好几个电工
No, I asked a bunch of electricians.

368
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,110
他们有自己的聊天室
They have their own chat rooms,

369
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,540
那地方聊的都是配电什么的
you know, like where all they talk about was wiring?

370
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,780
真他妈邪门  最近什么都能从网上找到
Freakin' Internet-- find anything on it these days.

371
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,540
你什么意见
What do you say?

372
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,110
既然来了  再去摸摸情况吧
Pop over, have another look-see?

373
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,480
听我说
Listen.

374
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,580
我觉得我们可能找到点线索
I think we possibly have a lead on something.

375
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,810
是吗
Yeah?

376
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,610
我们把一个家伙请进了局里
I have this guy down at the office.

377
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,810
他说他有些情报
He says he has some kind of information.

378
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,370
不过  他只肯对你一人讲
The thing is, he'll only give it to you,

379
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,850
面对面
in person.

380
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,430
行
Okay.

381
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,240
记着赫克托・塞拉曼加吗
Remember Hector Salamanca?

382
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,500
那死老头子
Sh-- Yeah.

383
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,350
怎么  莫非就那个敲铃铛的老瘸子
What, you mean the old cripple guy with the bell?

384
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,330
恐怕他那嘴比屁眼儿还紧吧
Rather crap on our floor than talk to us?

385
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,680
不  我干嘛要记住那个老不死的
No, I don't remember him at all. Why?

386
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,980
就是这个人
Well, he's the guy.

387
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,930
他的护理致电我们
His nurse calls us,

388
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,550
说他有事要谈
says he wants to powwow.

389
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,150
所以我们把他请到局里三个钟头
So we have this guy at the office for three hours,

390
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,500
可他就是要和你来谈
and he still just wants to talk to you.

391
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,680
想去那里  连门儿都没有
Do not even think about going down there.

392
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,990
玛丽
Marie.

393
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,800
明摆着就是个阴谋或者圈套
This is clearly a ploy or a trick or something

394
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,210
就是要把汉克诓到外面
designed to get Hank out into the open.

395
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,670
绝对如此
That's all this is.

396
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,620
-我们也这么想的  -说得好听
- That's what we thought. - Well.

397
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,500
这家伙已经金盆洗手多年了
It's been years since this guy's been a player.

398
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,080
他侄子也死了
His nephew's gone.

399
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,460
一个亲人都没有
Doesn't have anybody.

400
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,680
那个护士也查过了  什么都不知道
The nurse checks out-- doesn't know nothing.

401
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,320
完全没有头绪
Guess I just don't see an angle in it,

402
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,240
完全没有
if there even is one.

403
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,750
当然了  如果你愿意和他谈谈
Of course, if you did want to talk to this guy,

404
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,740
局里肯定是最安全的地方了
there's not safer place than the office.

405
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,210
我认为这是个坏主意
I don't think this sounds like a good idea.

406
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,540
我也是  汉克阿姨
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.

407
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,910
这简直太扯了
It is a ridiculous idea,

408
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,310
你绝对不能去
and there is no way you are going to do it,

409
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,640
没得商量
end of story.

410
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,010
汉克  多谢你过来
Hank, thanks for coming down.

411
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,710
没关系  长官  很高兴见到你
No problem at all. Good to see you, sir.

412
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,880
塞拉曼加先生
So Mr. Salamanca.

413
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,180

真是太抱歉了

442
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,480
至少这次他没拉裤子
Well, at least this time he didn't shit himself.

443
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,530
也算是有进步了
Guess that's progress.

444
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,010
喂
Yes.

445
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,370
我们有麻烦了
We may have a problem.

446
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,320
我在毒品管制局外面
I've got eyes on the DEA.

447
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,200
刚有人进去了
They just had a visitor--

448
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,270
是赫克托・塞拉曼加
Hector Salamanca

449
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,580
我都不知道该说什么了
I don't even know what to say to you right now.

450
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,870
你就给我坐在这里
You just sit here,

451
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,990
好好想想
and you think about how far

452
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,840
那种行为会给你带来多大的麻烦吧
that kind of behavior is going to get you.

453
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,800
后果很严重  我告诉你
Not far, let me tell you.

454
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,550
改变主意了吗
Any second thoughts?

455
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,080
那我们开始吧
Then let's get to work.

456
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,860
你好
Hello

457
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,060
平克曼先生
Mr. Pinkman...

458
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,600

为什么
Why?

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,130
怎么了
What happened?

461
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,840
毒检报告出来了
Tox screen came back.

462
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,280
不是蓖麻毒素
No ricin poisoning.

463
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,770
没想到吧
Surprised, huh?

464
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,110
不  怎么会没想到
No, why should I be?

465
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,410
外套别忘了
Your jacket.

466
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,870
后会有期
Till we meet again.

467
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,700
喂  停车
Yo! Right here.

468
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,870
安德莉亚  我只想问问布洛克的情况
Hey, Andrea, I'm just checking on Brock.

469
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,150
这件事好像
Uh, hey, it sounds like--

470
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,160
我是说  给我回电话好吗
I mean, listen, just call me if you can, all right?

471
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,420
我现在就回去
I'm headed back over.

472
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,180
对不起  打扰一下
Hey, excuse me.

473
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,170
喂
Yes.

474
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,560
我们接到平克曼了
We just picked up Pinkman.

475
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,130
没人看见
No witnesses.

476
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,330
赫克托呢
What about Hector?

477
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,520
里外我都查过了
I've checked inside and out.

478
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,460
没有窃听器和摄像头
No wires, no camera,

479
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,960
没人监视
no surveillance.

480
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,920
一小时前有警车巡逻经过
A police cruiser rolled through about an hour ago.

481
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,170
应该只是例行的
Seemed routine.

482
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,540
只有他一个人在房里
It's just him, alone in his room.

483
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,980
很好
All right.

484
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,410
我现在过去
I'm on my way.

485
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,950
这事由我来
Maybe it's better if--

486
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,020
比较好吧
if I do this myself.

487
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,470
我要亲自动手
I do this.

488
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,550
没问题了
It's all clear.

489
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,930
在这里等着
Wait here.

490
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,740
什么人才会去找毒品管制局
What kind of man talks to the DEA?

491
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,770
没人
No man.

492
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,530
完全没有
No man at all.

493
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,840
你这个残废的叛徒
A crippled little rata.

494
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,200
多响亮的名号啊
What a reputation to leave behind.

495
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,500
你想以这样的方式让后人记住你吗
Is that how you want to be remembered?

496
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,130
这是你最后看我的机会了  赫克托
Last chance to look at me, Hector.

497
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,770
天啊
Oh, my God.

498
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,310
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

499
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,270
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

500
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,320
投票一定是一样的
...the same vote for sure.

501
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,730
你知道吗  又到时间了
Hey, you know what? It's that time again,

502
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,330
我们该播报些你们自己遭遇的惨痛经历了
where we tell you about your own personal slice of hell

503
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,280
现在是"阿尔布开克午后通勤"时间
known as the Albuquerque afternoon commute.

504
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
那里情况有多糟
How bad are things looking out there?

505
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,310
告诉你们  这时候就在往南25公里处
I'll tell you what. Right now southbound 25

506
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,870
在杰弗逊街右路肩发生了一起事故
has got an accident there at Jefferson on the right shoulder,

507
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,270
所以车辆行径那片区域时
so make sure you stay to the left

508
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,780
请保持靠左行驶
as you move through that area,

509
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,560
在大"I"字形路口请减速行驶
and things have slowed to a crawl at the Big I,

510
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,880
在那里千万小心
no surprises there, either.

511
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,429
好的  等等
All right, hang on.

512
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,350
我不得不打断你一下
I hate to interrupt you here,

513
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,680
我有条爆炸性新闻
but I do have some breaking news here,

514
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,640
来自北方山谷
now coming out of the North Valley, apparently.

515
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,439
据报道  有家私人养老院发生了爆炸案
An explosion has been reported at a nursing home,

516
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,259
名叫卡萨・特拉奇拉老院

517
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,740
-不是吧  -你听说过那地方
- Oh, no. - You heard of that place.

518
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,770
很遗憾  目前为止还不清楚具体情况
We've got very few details on it so far,unfortunately.

519
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,380
最初报道的是
The initial report is, though,

520
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,980
遇难者多达三人
that as many as three people may have been killed.

521
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,620
天呐
Oh, no.

522
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,120
这则新闻令人不安
Now, the news is disturbing.

523
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,560
一旦有新消息
We're going to get you more information on this

524
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,530
我们会及时播报
just as soon as it comes in.

525
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,990
我能想象  那边情况相当棘手
Situation over there, I imagine, is pretty hectic.

526
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,430
-那里交通情况怎么样  -好
- What's traffic looking like? - Yeah,

527
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,610
我知道那家养老院在哪里
I know where the nursing home is.

528
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,609
如果你们路过那片区域
If you're moving through that area,

529
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,759
我们准备说的是东向西行的车道

530
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,500
就是在北方山谷的那片区域
in that area there in the North Valley.

531
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,089
如果你要穿过那里  请绕开那片区域
Please, you've got to avoid that area as you move through.

532
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,509

你想用断手制毒吗
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

538
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,520
下一步  二氧化碳
Next step, CO2.

539
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,450
做吧
Do it.

540
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,550
最好能让我听到响声
I better hear them click.

541
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,590
怎么了  你不能老实在上面待着吗
What, you got a problem with stairs?

542
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,050
古斯死了
Gus is dead.

543
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,430
我们还有事要做
We've got work to do.

544
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,470
快跑
Vámonos!

545
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,660
他会康复的
Uh, he's going to pull through.

546
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,190
是吗
Yeah?

547
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,080
对  看上去有生命危险
Yeah, it looked kind of touch-and-go

548
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,530
有那么一会儿  可他会...
there for a while, but he's gonna--

549
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,580
他会挺过来
he's gonna make it.

550
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,450
谢天谢地
Thank God.

551
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,460
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

552
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,490
可医生还是坚持说不是因为蓖麻毒素
You know, still saying it wasn't the ricin.

553
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,460
我不太明白
I don't understand.

554
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,460
还能是什么
Then what was it?

555
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:17,200
说最可能是因为
Saying it was most likely

556
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,500
一种名叫铃兰的花
a flower called lily of the valley.

557
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,250
对  这种花很常见
Yeah, it's-- it's, like, common.

558
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,570
它含有红色果仁
It's got these red berries on it

559
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,060
味道应该是甜的
that I guess taste sweet,

560
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,740
有时会有小孩子尝鲜
and sometimes little kids eat them

561
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,420
结果就中毒了  就这样
and wind up poisoning themselves, and that's it,

562
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,790
没别的了
nothing more.

563
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,490
所以古斯终究没有给他下毒
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

564
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,080
但他还是...
Still, he--

565
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,530
他还是非死不可  对吧
he had to go, right?

566
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,640
绝对的
You're damn right.

567
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,880
古斯非死不可
Gus had to go.

568
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,880
你知道  我该...
Um, you know, I should--

569
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,030
我该回去了
I should get back.

570
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,390
安德莉亚在等我
Andrea's waiting.

571
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,150
我在卡萨・特拉奇拉养老院
I'm here at Casa Tranquila,

572
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,460
今早这间敬老院发生了爆炸
where three people are dead following an explosion

573
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,600
三人丧生
that rocked this elderly care facility earlier today.

574
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,540
爆炸引发的火球把一件卧室完全烧没了
The fireball completely consumed one resident's room

575
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,470
还损坏了旁边的公共区域
and damaged common areas nearby.

576
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,390
沃尔特
Walt?

577
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,020
沃尔特  我找个安静点的地方听你电话
Walt, let me get somewhere where I can hear you.

578
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,720
告诉他汉克叔叔说的对
Tell him Uncle Hank was right. Shh.

579
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,010
沃尔特
Walt?

580
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,400
你还好吗
How are you doing?

581
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,840
你还问我  你还好吗
How am I doing? How are you doing?

582
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,770
我...
I'm, uh...

583
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,010
我还不错
I'm doing quite well.

584
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,920
很好
I'm good.

585
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,520
天呐  沃尔特  有新闻
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

586
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,460
古斯・福林死了
Gus Fring is dead.

587
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,490
他和一个墨西哥贩毒集团成员
He was blown up along with some person

588
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,570
一起被炸死了
from some Mexican cartel,

589
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,530
毒品管制局也不知道怎么回事
and the DEA has no idea what to make of it.

590
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,330
你知情吗
Do you know about this?

591
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,170
-沃尔特  我要你...  -结束了
- Walt? I need you to - It's over.

592
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,230
我们安全了
We're safe.

593
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,810
是你干的吗
Was this you?

594

发生什么事了
What happened?

595
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,310
我赢了
I won.
