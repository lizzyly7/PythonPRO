Uh, it-- it's me.

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,700
我只想说
I-- I just wanted to say

6
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,610
我一直惦记着你和孩子们
that I was thinking about you and the kids,

7
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,610
还有
and, uh...

8
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
我爱你
I love you.

Uh, it-- it's me.

我只想说

我一直惦记着你和孩子们
that I was thinking about you and the kids,

还有

13
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,120
早
Morning.

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,200
都日落三竿了
Afternoon.

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,350
是吗  天呐
Oh. Really? Jesus.

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,840
你不该让我睡的
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

17
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,940
你缺觉
You needed it.

18
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,700
斯凯勒  我记不清昨晚发生的事了
Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.

19
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,440
我是说  如果
I mean, if...

20
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,840
我说了些...
I said something--

21
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,380
你认识这个叫盖尔・伯蒂彻的吗
Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?

22
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,740
斯凯勒  我酒还没醒
Skyler, I can't even focus. I don't--

23
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,840
盖尔・伯蒂彻
Gale Boetticher.

24
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,830
认识他吗
Did you know him?

25
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,940
天呐  这是怎么了
Oh, my God. What?

26
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,840
我昨晚到底说了什么
What exactly did I say last night?

27
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,510
该说的都说了
Just enough.

28
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,180
你们在一起工作么
Did you work together?

29
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,980
谁杀了他
Who killed him?

30
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,040
是你的老板吗
Was it the people you work for?

31
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,280
当然不是
Definitely not.

32
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,810
这人是不是
Was it somebody who--

33
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,540
也有可能
at some point...

34
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,640
对你下杀手
might want to do the same to you?

35
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,080
应该不会
I seriously doubt it.

36
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,140
不
No.

37
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,540
天呐
God.

38
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
天呐
Oh, God.

39
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,940
我知道昨晚发生了什么事  沃尔特
I think I know what happened last night, Walt.

40
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,040
我清楚知道昨晚发生的事
Mm. I know exactly what happened last night.

41
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,340
我喝高了
I drank too much wine.

42
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,450
你告诉汉克
You told Hank

43
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,880
他找的人可能还逍遥法外
that the man he was looking for might still be out there,

44
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,110
还说可能根本不是
that it might not be this--

45
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,140
这个叫伯蒂彻的人
...Boetticher after all.

46
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,950
然后我整晚没睡
And I was up all night

47
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,780
一直在想你为什么对他说这些话
wondering why you would say that to him.

48
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,280
因为我喝醉了  斯凯勒
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

49
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,410
不是  可然后
No, but then--

50
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,580
可然后我想起来
but then I was remembering

51
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,240
你的眼睛被打青了
your black eye--

52
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,310
你总不愿提起
your, uh, business disagreement

53
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,810
的工作上的分歧
that you don't want to talk about.

54
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,740
我从不愿谈起这些
I don't want to talk about any of this ever.

55
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,310
防火墙  屏蔽了  不谈了
The firewall, all right?

56
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,400
政教分离  家庭和工作也是
Church and state.

57
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,550
这件事我们就这么处置
That's how we need to approach this thing.

58
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,580
然后我又想起那天你
And then I remembered the message

59
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,480
给我留的言
You left me the other day...

60
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,540
你说你爱我
when you said you loved me.

61
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,010
我听到这句的时候  以为你可能...
When I heard that, I thought that maybe...

62
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,250
你...  我也说不清
you-- I don't know--

63
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,210
我感觉你在忏悔我们之前发生的事
that you were regretting what's happened between us,

64
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
我能体会到
and I get that.

65
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,780
但就在昨晚过后
After last night, I--

66
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,140
沃尔特  我觉得你很害怕
Walt, I think you're scared.

67
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,810
我觉得那条留言就像
I think that message was some...

68
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,540
是种道别
kind of goodbye.

69
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,680
斯凯特
Oh, Skyler.

70
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,780
我觉得昨晚你在求救
I think last night was a cry for help.

71
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,110
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

72
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,170
求救
Cry for help.

73
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,680
我认为你心底想让汉克抓住你
I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.

74
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,180
那真是
That is just--

75
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,440
真是
That is--

76
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,540
就是这样
That is it.

77
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,610
一点没错
Exactly, yes.

78
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,910
你就像是高明的心理医生
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

79
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,280
天呐
God!

80
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,250
如果他抓住你  至少这些就都结束了
If he caught you, at least this would all be over.

81
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,840
没错  真是个千斤大鼎
Oh, yeah. That's a tremendous weight

82
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
重重压在我身上
just lifted off of me.

83
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,310
现在我有了自我认识
Now I-- I understand myself.

84
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,040
多谢  多谢
Thank you. Thank you.

85
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,380
沃尔特
Walt.

86
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,780
我说过
I've said it before.

87
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,410
你要是有危险  就得去报警
If you are in danger, we go to the police.

88
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,400
不  我我想听到警察这字眼
Oh, no. I don't want to hear about the police.

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,790
我不是随便说说
I do not say that lightly.

90
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,210
我知道这对我们家可能造成的后果
I know what it could do to this family.

91
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,520
可如果这是我们仅剩的办法
But if it's the only real choice we have--

92
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,010
如果不这么做
if it's either that-- Oh...

93
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,480
你就只能坐以待毙
or your getting shot when you open your front door--

94
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,140
我不想听到警察这字眼
I don't want to hear about the police.

95
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,710
沃尔特  你又不是什么惯犯
You're not some hardened criminal, Walt.

96
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,710
你是无心之过
You're in over your head.

97
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,580
我们就是这么告诉他们的  那是事实
That's what we tell them. That's the truth.

98
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,840
不是事实
That is not the truth.

99
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,410
当然是
Of course it is.

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,939
一个中学教师  癌症患者  会急于筹钱
A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money?

101
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,580
好了  不说了
Okay, we're done here.

102
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,540
误入歧途而至于身不由己
Roped into working for--

103
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,310
不能收手
Unable to even quit?

104
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,740
沃尔特  那是你亲口说的
You told me that yourself, Walt.

105
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,310
我到底是怎么想的
Jesus, what was I thinking?

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,910
沃尔特  求你了
Walt, please.

107
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,440
我们俩
Let's both of us

108
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,780
都别为这整件事争个不停了
stop trying to justify this whole thing

109
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,860
只要承认你有危险就好
and admit you're in danger.

110
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,520
你在跟谁说话呢
Who are you talking to right now?

111
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,040
你面前站着的是什么人  你知道吗
Who is it you think you see?

112
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,240
你知道我一年赚多少吗
Do you know how much I make a year?

113
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,940
即使我告诉你  你也不会相信
I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.

114
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,340
你知道我突然半途而废
Do you know what would happen

115
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,880
会有什么下场吗
if I suddenly decided to stop going in to work?

116
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,689
一桩足以登上
A business big enough

117
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,110
纳斯达克席位的大买卖
that it could be listed on the NASDAQ

118
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,610
会破产  瞬间消失
goes belly-up, disappears.

119
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
没有我这生意就黄了   不行
It ceases to exist without me. No.

120
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,190
你显然不知道你在跟谁说话
You clearly don't know who you're talking to,

121
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,580
所以我来给你点提示吧
so let me clue you in.

122
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,280
我没有危险  斯凯勒
I am not in danger, Skyler.

123
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,680
我就是个危险人物
I am the danger.

124
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,637
坐以待毙
A guy opens his door and gets shot,

125
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,910
你这么小看我吗
and you think that of me?

126
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,010
不
No.

127
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,410
我是给别人吃枪子的人
I am the one who knocks.

128
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,910
听着  我...
Look, I was--

129
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,540
斯凯勒
Skyler?

130
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,780
看吧
Here we are.

131
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,000
和你离职时一模一样
Just like you left it.

132
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,310
你的漂亮老婆呢
And where is your pretty wife?

133
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,480
她还有其它生意要照看
She has other business to attend to.

134
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,180
照我之前和她说的
Well, like I say to her,

135
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,780
不增不减  明白吗
place is as is. Understand?

136
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,140
是  我明白
Yes, I understand.

137
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,140
好  好
Good. Good.

138
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,810
我可不想她回来又要加条件
I don't want her coming back with more demands.

139
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,940
她砍价的时候可没让我好过
She-- She gave me hard time when we settled on price.

140
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,640
博格丹  我们达成一致了
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

141
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,440
你要的全在这里
So here's everything you need.

142
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,980
我这儿手续齐全
I keep very good files.

143
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,940
谢谢
Thank you.

144
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,610
你现在是老板了
So you are the boss now, huh?

145
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,210
你准备好了吗
You think you're ready?

146
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,710
我想是吧
Yes, I-- I think so.

147
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,880
当老板要强硬
Being boss is tough.

148
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,910
我知道你觉得我之前在为难你们
I know you think I was hard on you,

149
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,880
但你以后会理解的
but you'll learn.

150
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,480
当家不易
Being in charge is not easy.

151
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,240
需要吃苦耐劳
It takes hard work.

152
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,410
你已经见过我工作卖力了  博格丹
You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.

153
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,840
是吗  我不确定
Yeah? I don't know.

154
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,810
也许还没尽全力吧
Now so much, maybe.

155
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,410
不过也许  你当上老板
But maybe, when you are the boss,

156
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,140
也只会不管不顾
uh, you will just keep your feet up

157
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,810
悠闲自在吧
and relax.

158
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,310
当老板的关键
The real important thing,

159
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,780
这点并不是所有人都知道的
and not everyone knows this is,

160
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,800
就是要强硬
is to be tough.

161
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,440
一个老板必须强硬
A boss has to be tough.

162
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,710
必须对人说不
Has to say no to people.

163
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,780
即使收银员不愿意
Has to make cashiers

164
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,930
也要逼他们
wipe down cars,

165
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,610
出去擦车
even if they don't want to.

166
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,640
你够强硬吗  沃特
Can you be tough, Walter?

167
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,110
我相信你应付得来
I-- I'm sure you can handle.

168
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,010
如果不行
And if not,

169
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,580
你还可以打给你老婆
you can always call your wife, huh?

170
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,040
总是很难打开  没大碍的
Always sticky. No problem.

171
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,580
保持原样
As is.

172
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,650
谁会想到
Who'd have thought

173
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,810
有天我会把这些钥匙交付给你
that someday I would be handing these keys to you?

174
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,380
太多年了  差点忘了
Many years. Almost forgot.

175
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,210
博格丹
Bogdan.

176
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,780
保持原样
As is.

177
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,600
谢谢
Thank you.

178
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,070
你没事吧
You okay there?

179
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,670
很好
Fine.

180
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,270
天黑了  我毒瘾犯了
It's night. I'm not using.

181
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,530
吃点东西吧
Eat something.

182
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,570
喂
Yeah.

183
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,330
没错  他们俩人
That's right. Both of them.

184
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,730
我这就出发
I'm on my way.

185
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,730
需要帮忙吗
You need any help?

186
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
不用
No.

187
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
想让我打电话  让她回来吗
You want me to call her back?

188
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,630
不用
No. No.

189
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,470
她到底说了什么
But what exactly did she say?

190
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,570
原话
Uh, exactly.

191
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,270
就是
Just, you know,

192
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,770
她问我好不好  让我别担心
she asked if I was okay and not to worry.

193
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,970
之类的
Like that.

194
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,830
说没说她接下来的打算
Any, uh, rough timetable on this thing,

195
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,400
或者提到什么时候回家
or as to when she's coming home?

196
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,770
是因为赌博  对吗
Uh, it's-- it's about the gambling, right?

197
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,270
这有点难
Well, it's-- it's kind of hard to--

198
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,070
她无法理解
She-- She can't understand.

199
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,830
你又不是故意的
It-- it-- It's not like you're doing this on purpose.

200
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,130
可你无法收手
You can't help it.

201
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,900
没这么简单
It's no that simple.

202
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,600
这是一种疾病
Look, you have a disease.

203
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,430
就像嗜酒一样  对吗
It-- It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

204
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,120
不  完全不是
No, it's not. Not at all.

205
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,260
是这样的  我在网上看到的
Yes, it is. I read online.

206
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,970
她甚至不能对你生气
She's not even allowed to be mad at you,

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,830
她不能对你的癌症生气  对吗
and she can't be mad at you about the cancer, can she?

208
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,630
不  儿子  这全然不是一回事
No, son, these are two very different things.

209
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,070
不尽然  赌博上瘾就是生病了
Not really. Gambling addiction is a sickness.

210
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,400
-你可以  -听着
- You can... - Listen.

211
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,300
我身上发生的事  与疾病无关
What is going on with me is not about some disease.

212
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,530
只关乎选择
It's about choices--

213
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,430
我既已做出的选择
choices that I have made,

214
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,490
我坚持履行的选择
choices I stand by.

215
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,670
你不会搬回来住了  对吗
You're not moving back in, are you?

216
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,030
不会了
No.

217
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,130
对了
Hey.

218
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,000
这样如何
You know what?

219
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,420
上学一会儿再说
School can wait.

220
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,590
我们绕道去个地方如何
Why don't we take a little detour?

221
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,920
去哪
What kind of detour?

222
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,860
你一去便知
You'll see.

223
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,390
我想是时候给你买辆车了
I think it's time we got you your own car.

224
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,660
你觉得呢
What do you think?

225
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
什么
What?

226
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,690
我在想如果你要收买我
I-- I think if you're going to buy me off...

227
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,660
彻底点
buy me off.

228
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,380
太棒了  太棒了
It's amazing. It's amazing.

229
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,130
它长得太帅了
Ah, it's good-looking.

230
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,190
我很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

231
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,020
我喜欢  谢谢你  老爸
I-- I do, Thank you, Dad.

232
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,360
好了  不客气
All right. You're welcome.

233
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,060
你来了
So you're here.

234
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,320
是啊
Yeah.

235
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,060
你真的来了  来工作
You're actually here? To work?

236
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,790
是啊  伙计
Yeah, man.

237
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,260
老天
Jesus.

238
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,290
杰西
Jesse.

239
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,590
过来
Come here.

240
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,340
我需要最新消息
All right, I need an update.

241
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,860
什么最新消息
Upda on what?

242
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,500
你和麦克这些外出工作
An update on these little field trips

243
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,360
到底是怎么回事
that you've been taking with Mike.

244
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,960
我已经跟你说了  我们去收钱
I told you already. We pick up money,

245
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,720
检查业务  之类的事
check on things, stuff like that.

246
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,890
你还是他的保镖  对吗
And you're his bodyguard, right?

247
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,260
可是什么  这是你之前说的
But what? That's what you said.

248
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,490
我说我保护了他  就像是支援
I said I guarded him, like backup,

249
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,760
就像是第二双眼
like a second set of eyes.

250
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,760
每个人都需要支援  对吧
Everybody needs backup, right?

251
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,690
那就必须是你么
And this has to be you.

252
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,220
不能是别的...  什么
It can't be... I don't know.

253
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,690
泰鲁斯  或者别的什么古斯雇佣的
Tyrus or any of those couple dozen muscle heads

254
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,290
肌肉猛男
that Gus has working for him?

255
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,660
必须得是杰西・平克曼
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

256
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,020
为什么
Why?

257
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,890
你有什么我不知道的过人之处
What is there, something about you that I don't know?

258
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,160
你是前海豹部队成员吗
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

259
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,590
你要把你的手
Do you have to have your hands

260
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,239
注册为致命武器吗
registered as lethal weapons?

261
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,360
给你根中指注册吧
Register this.

262
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,060
我要说的是  你都不觉得其中有诈吗
All I'm saying is that do you not even question this?

263
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,390
你真的相信他们需要你吗
Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people?

264
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,860
我不是要出口伤人
And I'm not trying to be insulting.

265
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,720
我只是想让你想清楚
I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.

266
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,020
我看他们不是要杀我
I see they can't outright kill me,

267
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,490
他们是不想看我吸毒
but they don't want me getting high.

268
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,290
我是从古斯让麦克看着我的时候起
I see this thing probably started

269
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,630
就这么感觉了
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

270
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,090
但你知道吗
But you know what?

271
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,120
我保护了麦克不被抢劫
I saved Mike from getting robbed,

272
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,390
他甚至可能被杀
even killed, maybe.

273
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,760
所以我可能压根就不是个窝囊废
So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.

274
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,990
那如果...
I mean, what if it--

275
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,460
老天
Oh, God.

276
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,020
如果这一切只是圈套呢
I mean, what if-- what if it's all just a setup?

277
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,090
-什么  -如果你阻止的那次抢劫
- What? - What if this robbery that you stopped

278
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
不是真的呢
wasn't even real?

279
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,210
好好想想
I mean, think about it.

280
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,420
你给麦克放风的头一天
Your first day out guarding Mike.

281
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,540
他一出车门  就有情况发生
he steps out for one second, and what happens?

282
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,520
你立刻就被抢劫
You immediately get robbed.

283
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,990
你简直混蛋
You are such an asshole.

284
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,560
接近朋友  更要接近敌人
Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.

285
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,910
就像你说的
Like you said,

286
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,120
因为有我  古斯不可能杀你
Gus can't kill you because of me.

287
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,590
他知道我不会坐视不管的
He knows I won't stand for it.

288
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,700
他需要我  又不想接受他需要我这个事实
He needs me, and he hates the fact that he needs me,

289
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,680
那他该怎么办呢  他就试图
so what does he do? He goes to work

290
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,530
离间我和你的关系
driving a wedge between you and me.

291
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,080
你真是个混球  你要是在场
You're an asshole. If you'd been there,

292
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,430
你就知道那不是圈套
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

293
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,160
等一下  这些家伙追你多长时间了
Wait a minute. How long did those guys chase you?

294
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,660
就你的描述来看
Huh? Because the way you describe it,

295
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,290
他们也太容易就放弃了
they gave up pretty damn easy.

296
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,390
不  不  这
No, no. This--

297
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,420
这整件事  所有的一切
This whole thing, all of this--

298
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,770
都是因为我
it's all about me.

299
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,160
喂
Hello.

300
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,320
你是谁  等下
Uh, who is it? Hang on.

301
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,160
是我
Yeah.

302
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,230
我马上上去
I'll be right up.

303
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,620
怎么了
What?

304
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,820
我得走了
I got to go.

305
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,820
那我要自己把这都打扫干净么
Well, am I supposed to clean all this on my own?

306
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,920
天呐
God.

307
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,824
<i>(西班牙语:)  早上好
<i>(Spanish:)  Buenos días, </i>

308
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:31,825
女士们

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,710
<i>早上好
<i>Buenos días. </i>

310

Uh, do you speak English?

311
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:34,877
<i>-你会说英语么
<i>-?Se habla inglés?</i>

312
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:35,578

No. Okay, uh...

我们的活就是看着那栋房子
Uh, the deal is we're watching that house.

362
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,170
前面左边门前有棵树的那栋
A couple down on the left with the tree in the front.

363
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,470
是么  为什么
Yeah? What for?

364
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,300
有只小鸟告诉我  那里面有一些家伙
A little birdie told me there's some guys in there

365
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,040
拿着我们三磅的货
that have 3 pounds of our product

366
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,400
想出手
which they're selling

367
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,300
而且那些货不是从我们手里买的
and which they sure as hell didn't get from us.

368
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,370
那计划是什么
So what's the plan?

369
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,600
我刚告诉你了
I just told you.

370
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,500
我们坐在这看着那栋房子
We sit here and watch that house

371
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,540
直到里面其中一个"企业家"露出头来
until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out.

372
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,440
然后我们问几个问题  把东西拿回来
Then we ask a few questions and get our property back.

373
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,520
我们为什么不直接破门而入
Why don't you just go break the door down

374
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,860
用手枪告诉那些混蛋谁才是老大
and pistol whip those bitches and show them who's boss?

375
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,470
因为这只小鸟还告诉我
Because a little birdie also told me

376
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,540
这些家伙对这些产品很上瘾
these guys are heavily into the product

377
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,600
还喜欢带枪
and most likely armed.

378
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,900
现在  对于瘾君子你所不知道的是
Now, what you may not know about meth heads--

379
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,540

380
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,300
他们都有点不按套路出牌
they're kind of unpredictable.

381
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,400
我不喜欢不按套路出牌的人
I don't care for unpredictable,

382
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,870
所以我们等着
so we wait.

383

你别想骗我
You don't put thoughts in my head!

473
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,140
是  是  你说的对
Absolutely. You're right.

474
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,394
你说的对
You're right.

475
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,240
塔克
Tucker.

476
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,870
<i>谢谢  十分感谢
<i>muchas, muchas gracias, amigas.</i>

477
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,009
<i>非常感谢  给你
<i>Muchas gracias. Here you go.</i>

478
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,139
<i>谢谢
<i>Oh, gracias.</i>

479
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,459
<i>玛莉亚  维尼塔  露西亚  谢谢
<i>María, Vernita, Lucía, gracias.</i>

480
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,080
<i>非常感谢
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

481
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,550
<i>非常感谢
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

482
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,620
这句没听懂  不过应该是好话
I missed that one. I'm sure it was good.

483
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,940
<i>女士们  跟我来
<i>Damas. Vengan conmigo.</i>

484
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,950
告诉我  你要带她们去哪
Tell me... Where are you taking them?

485
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,980
泰鲁斯  你要干嘛
Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?

486
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,080
我要送她们上车
I'm putting them on a bus.

487
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,350
什么车  为什么
Why? What bus?

488
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,990
送她们回洪都拉斯的车
One that takes them back to Honduras.

489
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,930
等等  等一下
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

490
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,220
这都是我的主意
Th-Th-This was my idea.

491
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,460
别惩罚她们
Don't punish them.

492
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,620
你让古斯冲着我来
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

493
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,450
就是冲着你来的
He does.

494
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,700
你回避一下行吗
Give us a minute, will you?

495
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,730
不会太久的
We won't be too long.

496
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,170
劫车的那伙人把我们的货
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo

497
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,400
送给附近的无名小卒
to a couple of local nobodies.

498
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,870
很有纪律
Very disciplined, though,

499
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,100
自己一点都没留
not keeping anything for themselves.

500
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,430
他们这么做
It was all about sending a message,

501
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,730
只为传递一个信息
which they did, literally.

502
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,170
都写在桶盖上了
It was written on the bucket lid.

503
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,130
准备好谈谈了吗
"Ready to talk?"

504
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,300
翻译过来应该是这个意思
That, I believe, is the English translation.

505
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,970
你也许不想听我的意见
I know you're not really asking for advice,

506
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,940
但如果给我
but let me hire 10, 15

507
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,310
10到15能干的人
more good operators,

508
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,889
我就能狠狠的教训他们一下
and we hit them back, hit them hard,

509
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,930
把他们赶回老家去
hit them where they live.

510
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,189
不
No.

511
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,730
暂时不要开战
This war stays cold for now.

512
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,570
那他们的消息怎么办  你准备怎么应对
What about their message? What's the answer?

513
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,770
安排他们和我见面
Set up a meeting.

514
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,870
看看他们想要说什么
Let's see what they have to say.

515
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,500
他今天表现怎么样
How did he do today?

516
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,730
听说你干得不错
I hear you can handle yourself.

517
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,370
可能吧
I guess.

518
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,630
晚安
Good night.

519
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,500
等等
Uh, excuse me.

520
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,700
为什么找我
Why me?

521
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,900
我相信我看人的眼光
I like to think I see things in people.

522
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,730
慢点吃  车又不会自己跑掉
Slow down. The car is not going anywhere.

523
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,570
妈
Mom.

524
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,830
亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart.

525
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,970
宝宝你去那
Whoo. Ah. There you go.

526
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,970
你看见外面那辆车了吗
Did you see what's in the driveway?

527
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,170
看见了
Uh, yeah, I saw.

528
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
你的吗
So that's yours, huh?

529
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,600
是啊  爸给我买的
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

530
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,900
他真好啊
That was very nice of him.

531
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,830
是啊
Yeah.

532
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,430
我知道那车看起来很炫
I-- I know it looks like...

533
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,400
但很安全的
well, awesome, but it's super safe.

534
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,730
爸他检查过了
Dad-- Dad made sure.

535
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,200
我保证绝不超速
And I promise to always go the speed limit

536
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,570
一定慢慢开
or below, way below.

537
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,600
而且这车超省油的
And it gets great gas mileage.

538
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,390
爸说我可以开出去兜兜风
So Dad said I can take it around the block a few times.

539
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,780
可以吗
That okay?

540
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,100
就在附近转转
Just around the block.

541
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,270
好吧  别开太远
Yeah. Just around the block.

542
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,870
还有小心点  行吗
And be careful, okay?

543
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
好的
I will.

544
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,230
拜
Bye.

545
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,130
妈
I-It-- It's really--

546
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,170
有你在家真好
It's really great to have you home, Mom.

547
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,321
一定要小心  听见了吗
Hey, seriously, be careful, okay?

548
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:11,840
知道了
I will.

549
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,040
好
Okay.

550
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,870
我们谈谈吧
I guess we should talk.

551
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,570
那天谈得够多了
Oh, I think you said plenty the other day.

552
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,300
关于那个  我只是
No. Look, about that, it just--

553
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,100
你拿到洗车房的钥匙了吗
Did you get the car wash keys?

554
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,930
拿到了
Um, yes, yes.

555
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,630
斯凯勒  我那天说的
Skyler, I may have...

556
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,400
可能有点夸张了
overstated things earlier,

557
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,170
我为我的失言感到抱歉
and I'm sorry to be so forward.

558
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,530
但是  我只想
But I-- I just--

559
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,430
让你知道
I want you to know something.

560
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,800
我想让你
I want you to--

561
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,130
想让你明白
I need you to understand

562
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,270
你是安全的
that you are safe.

563
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,100
你  儿子还有女儿
You, Junior, Holly--

564
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,980
你们都是安全的
you are completely safe.

565
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,970
我所做的一切
Everything that I do-- everything--

566
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,500
都是为了保护这个家庭
I do it to protect this family.

567
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,000
所以  你买车
So buying that car,

568
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,300
也是在保护这个家吗
that was protecting your family?

569
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,469
好吧
Okay. I, uh--

570
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,310
我承认这件事做的有点鲁莽
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,

571
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,030
但他想要辆车
but he needed a car, and--

572
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,870
我是他父亲
and I'm his father,

573
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,430
理应完成他的愿望不是吗
and I should be able to get what he wants.

574
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,930
明天把车退回去
It goes back tomorrow.

575
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,440
斯凯勒  他会伤心死的
Skyler, it will crush him.

576
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,100
买车会戳破我们的谎
That car directly contradicts our story.

577
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,690
如果你真的在意  想保护这个家庭
And if you're so invested in protecting this family,

578
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,400
你就要圆这个谎
it means protecting the story.

579
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,430
你觉得邻居会怎么想  沃尔特
What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?

580
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,200
汉克和玛丽呢
What about Hank and Marie?

581
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,970
还有国税局
How about the IRS?

582
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,300
你到底在想什么  沃尔特
What were you thinking, Walt?

583
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,870
我想的是
I was thinking

584
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,500
我想为我儿子做点什么
that I wanted to do something nice for my son.

585
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,370
听着
Look.

586
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,670
我担心他会因此怨恨你
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.

587
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,070
他当然会
Oh, he will.

588
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,900
多亏了你  他要再一次地怨恨他的贱人妈妈
Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother

589
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,500
怨她拿走了他敬爱的父亲
for taking away what his loving father has given him,

590
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,800
送他的东西
so thanks for that.

591
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,190
但你知道吗  沃尔特
But you know what, Walt?

592
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,100
比起你这个只会嘴上说着保护
Someone has to protect this family

593
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,130
我才是真正在保护这个家的人
from the man who protects this family.
