1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:07,061
这是我的简历
Here's my resume.

2
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:11,089
严格来说  叫"学术简历"
I mean, technically it says "curriculum vitae,"

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,039
虽然这么叫会更专业点  不过
Which I think is more professional, but,

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,085
其实两个都差不多的
You know, same thing pretty much.

5
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,020
有简历倒是不错  不过这个岗位其实
That's...wow. Great. But this position truly is

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,089
不太需要什么工作经验
A no-experience-necessary kind of things.

7
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,061
虽然简历里没有写到
Well, and it doesn't really say it here,

8
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:30,043
不过我在销售方面很有背景优势
But I have a solid background in sales.

9
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,069
我做事很主动的
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so.

10
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:36,009
-很不错  但是  -不错
- That's excellent, but...  - Excellent. I just...

11
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,015
我觉得我可以成为
I really feel I could be a major,

12
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:42,047
您销售团队中的主力
Major asset to your sales force.

13
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:47,042
我想可能有点小误会
I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding.

14
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:49,033
这其实不是真正意义上的销售
This isn't actually a sales job.

15
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,060
我很乐意考虑你担任销售
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position,

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,067
但是我们的员工需要有资格证
But our agents need to be licensed,

17
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,005
至少两年的相关工作经验
Have at least two years on-the-job experience,

18
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,007
而且一般是本科毕业
And usually a college degree.

19
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:06,059
你更适合的工作应该是
What you would be doing is more like...

20
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:08,025
广告类
Advertising.

21
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:23,006
你好啊  杰西
Hey, Jesse!

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,079
嘿  哥们
Hey, man!

23
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,094
等一下  哥们  怎么了
Yo, man! What up?

24
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:29,021
猴子
Badger?

25
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,059
最近都在哪混啊
Where you been keeping yourself?

26
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,078
行头不错嘛
Nice duds.

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,058
你的也不赖啊
Yeah. You, too.

28
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,094
谢谢
Thanks.

29
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:40,089
你为什么要干这么傻的工作
Yo, why would you want to do this lame ass job anyway?

30
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:43,050
别误会  我无意冒犯
I mean, no offense.

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,087
因为我在服缓刑
Because I'm on probation, yo.

32
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:47,070
需要证明自己已经改过自新
Gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated.

33
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:51,062
成为正直的公民  都是那种屁话
Upstanding citizen. All that shit.

34
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:53,079
不过也算是很好的锻炼
It's really good exercise, too.

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,011
你不能光站在那
Look. You can't just stand there.

36
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,032
还得旋转箭头
You have to spin the arrow.

37
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:00,010
像直升机的动作  这些你都得学
There's all these moves you have to learn, like a helicopter.

38
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,083
看到了吗
See?

39
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:09,007
这个动作比较难
That one's a bitch.

40
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:10,071
我还不太熟练
I'm not very good at it yet.

41
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:13,094
不  你真的让我大开眼界了
No, you really opened my eyes to the possibilities.

42
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,001
不管怎么说
Hey, anyways...

43
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,098
-谢谢借我抽一口  -要抽找我就是
- Thanks for the toke.  - Anytime.

44
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,064
说起这个
Speaking of which...

45
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:24,095
你能不能给我弄点冰毒
You think you could maybe hook me up with some crystal?

46
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,080
不行  我已经金盆洗手很久了
Nah, I've been out of the business for a while.

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,002
-其实我正打算隐退  -什么  不是吧
- Actually now thinking about retiring.  - What? No!

48
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,062
你做的货难以置信
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

49
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:37,034
那确实是相当棒
It was pretty awesome.

50
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:38,090
隐退
Retirement?

51
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,000
我没听错吧
I can't be hearing this!

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,015
我有一个搭档在帮我制毒
I had this partner who was helping me cook.

53
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:47,041
其实主要是我在出力  不过
I mean, I was doing most of the work, but...

54
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,065
他是个混蛋  所以
He was an asshole, so...

55
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:55,092
光顾的买家也就越来越少了
Anyway, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by.

56
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,057
我可以帮你介绍买家
No, I can hook you up with some pseudo.

57
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:00,080
大买家
Major pseudo.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,060
哥们  我可是有渠道的
I got channels, bro.

59
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,079
我们可以合伙
We could partner up.

60
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,088
不要有压力
No pressure. No pressure.

61
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,078
你就考虑下  好吗
Just think about it, all right?

62
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:12,020
该死  我得走了
Oh shit.

63
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,084
我得走了
I gotta go.

64
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,008
储蓄所往这边走咯
Yo, this way to savings!

65
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,040
能帮你省钱啊
Save your dollar bills, yo!

不会的  他会喜欢的
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

我都不知道自己怎么做的思考
I don't know what I was thinking.

84
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,009
请帖上不是说"不要送礼"吗
Didn't the invitation even say "no gifts"?

85
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,001
-沃尔特  -又怎么啦
- Walt. - What?

86
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,085
我们一定要去的
We have to go.

我知道  我这不是抱怨
I know. I'm not complaing.

88
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,066
你就是在抱怨
Yes, you are.

89

听着  我们要去的
Look, we need this.

90
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:29,054
最近经历了太多事情  知道吗
We've been through a lot lately, okay?

91
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,056
天哪
Jesus.

92
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,026
我们好久没参加这样的派对了
Guess we didn't get the beige memo.

93
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,068
没事
We're okay.

94
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:42,071
我像是穿着1985年款礼服的怪人
Yes, I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985.

95

亲爱的  你看起来很不错
Honey, you look fine.

沃尔特  这是我找到的唯一一件合身的
Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me.

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,099
你看那里  请帖上竟然写"不要送礼"
Would you look at that? The invitation said "no gifts."

98
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,057
别这样
Oh, come on.

99
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:58,014
先生  我帮您收起来吧
Sir, I'll take that for you.

是啊  正在考虑
Yeah, thinking about it.

00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,080

- A lot of luck.  - Oh, well, no.

131
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,060
不好意思  我们要过去打招呼
Will you excuse us? We gotta say hi.

沃尔特
Walt?

137
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,008
果然没认错
I thought that was you.

138
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,033
法利
Farley!

139
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,003
好久不见
Long time no see.

140
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:05,032
这是沃尔特·怀特
This Walter White.

141
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:07,036
在大学的时候  他是...
Back at cal tech, he was...

142
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,004
你简直就是结晶学大师
You were just the master of crystallography.

143
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:11,070
我记得有一次  我们
I remember this one time, we were

144
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,012
在一个蛋白质问题上卡了好几个礼拜
Stuck on this protein problems for weeks!

145
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,039
你不过就看了眼
You just breezed right in

146
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,098
然后对我们说了一个词
And you had one word for us, too.

147
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,066
-同步加速器  -没错  同步加速器
- Synchrotrons. - It was synchrotrons, yeah.

148
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,049
他们在X射线下能做生成
They generate purer and more

149
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,049
更完美更高纯度的晶态
Complete patterns in X-ray beams.

150
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,098
之前的只不过是写数据收集工作
Data collection takes a fraction of the time.

151
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,055
怀特可是格雷麦特命名者之一
This is the White in Gray Matter.

152
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,061
告诉他们  沃尔特
Tell 'em, Walt.

153
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,073
好
Okay.

154
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,080
早先我们还在研究生院的时候
Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school,

155
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,058
艾略特和我想出这个名字
We came up with the name.

156
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:46,001
简写成布莱克  沃尔特·怀特[黑色+白色]
Short, Black, Walter·White.

157
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:49,023
这就是格雷麦特科技的由来[灰色公司]
So, together they became Gray Matter technologies.

158
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,084
-可爱吧  -你和埃利奥特是合伙人么
- Cute, huh? - So you run the company with Elliott?

159
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:56,003
不  那是格蕾琴和埃利奥特
Well, no, no, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

160
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,016
我更倾向于教育方面
I gravitated toward education.

161
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:00,034
在哪所大学
What university?

162
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:07,041
电吉他
It's a stratocaster!

163
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,025
不光光是电吉他
Not just any strat.

164
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,074
这可是克莱普顿的
That's one of Clapton's.

165
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,044
不会吧
No way.

166
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,004
敬埃利奥特
"To elliott.

167
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,094
不好意思皮扣有点松  埃里克·克莱普顿
"Sorry about the buckle rash. Eric Clapton."

168
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:20,084
谢谢  这太漂亮了
Thank you. This is beautiful.

169
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:22,053
他干吗这么做
Why is he doing this?

170
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,077
当自己8岁吗
What is he, like eight years old?

171
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:27,025
给  亲爱的
Here, honey.

172
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,086
谢谢
Thanks.

173
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,085
这是沃尔特送的
Oh, this is from Walt.

174
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:35,050
-天哪  -没事
- God. - It's okay!

175
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:48,034
方便面
Yum-good ramen.

176
00:09:58,058 --> 00:10:02,027
为了写论文
This is what Walt and I...

177
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:07,004
我和沃尔特两人
Lived on for 10 months straight

178
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,015
10个月赖以生存的东西
While we were working on our thesis.

179
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:12,095
在五金店旁边那个商店有卖
They sold them down at Ralsto's in the hardware aisle,

180
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,098
就在  那什么旁边来着
Right next to the... the what was it?

181
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:16,082
-斯特诺  -斯特诺旁边
- Sterno.  - The Sterno.

182
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,070
10包才1.99美金
Yeah, 10 for $1.99.

183
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,092
至今我已然确信
To this day, I am convinced

184
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:25,018
这些面条是我们不可或缺的助力
These noodles were responsible for our success.

185
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:27,004
这是我们的生命之源
This was our lifeblood.

186
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,078
你在哪里找到的
Where'd you find these?

187
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,081
我以为多年前就成非法产品了
I thought they'd been outlawed years ago.

188
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,086
我喜欢
I love it.

189
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,052
谢谢你  沃尔特
Thank you, Walt.

190
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:43,040
送给拥有一切的人
For the man who has everything.

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,031
-不  不  -就是
- No, no. - It was.

192
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:47,041
你记得那个胖子吗
You remember the fat guy, the fat guy.

193
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,038
我们以前叫他鼻涕虫的胖子
We used to call him "snot trough"

194
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,011
因为他老是挂着...
Because he had that thing under his n...

195
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,063
-什么来着  -那是多普金斯
- What do you call that thing? - That was Dobkins!

196
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:55,014
和那个一天到晚闻起来
That was the same guy who always

197
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,065
巨臭无比的是同一个人
Smelled like chocked nose.

198
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,079
-就是  -不  不是
- It was!  - No, no, no, no.

199
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,093
那个不是多普金斯
It wasn't Dobkins. It was...

200
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:05,026
我发誓  因为那人老是穿
Anyway, I swear to Christ he used to iron those patches

201
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:09,030
在手肘那里有块补丁的外套
Onto the elbows of his members only jacket because

202
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,095
他觉得那样很有型
He thought it made him look more distinguished.

203
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:12,081
-你觉得他有型么  -不
- Didn't it?  - No.

204
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,093
-敬鼻涕虫  -敬鼻涕虫
- Well, here's to snot trough. - To snot trough.

205
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,052
-不论他在哪里  -上帝保佑你
- Wherever you may be. - God bless him.

206
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:24,076
你还记得那个讨厌
And you remember the professor

207
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,046
罗伯特·威廉·本生的教授么
Who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

208
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,053
恩
Yes.

209
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,094
你只要一提到那个名字
All you had to do was mention the Bunsen Burner

210
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:33,017
他就会发飙
And he was off on a rant.

211
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:36,038
"他根本没发明这个"  还记得他老挥手么
"No, he didn't invent it." You remember the waving?

212
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,059
"他不过是证明了而已"
"He just improved it!" you know.

213
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,075
瞬间就能少上15分钟课
It was easy to kill 15 minutes anyway.

214
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:47,003
我真怀念我们之间这样的对话  沃尔特
Oh god, I miss this, Walt.

215
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,097
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

216
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:52,082
我们应该一起多聚聚
Listen, we ought to get together more often.

217
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:55,011
斯凯勒和我非常欢迎你和格蕾琴
Skyler and I would love to have you and

218
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,089
来我们家吃晚饭
Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

219
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,038
恩  当然
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

220
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,071
但我的意思是
But what I mean is

221
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:04,056
我们应该再次合作
That you and I should work together again.

222
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:09,095
-你来高中上课么  -说真的
- Are you going to teach high school? - No, no. Seriously.

223
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,083
之前有什么阻止我们么
What's stopping us?

224
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:17,061
等等  埃利奥特  你是说
Wait a minute. Elliott, what are you...

225
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:20,093
要我去格雷麦特工作么
Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter?

226
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,010
对啊  你很合适啊
Yeah. Why not? You'd fit right in.

227
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,004
你很有才气而且经验丰富
You're brilliant, you've got a ton of experience.

228
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,059
我...
Well, I...

229
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,029
我不知道怎么开始
I wouldn't really know where to begin. I mean...

230
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,027
你根本不了解
God. You have no idea.

231
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:38,052
我一天到晚就在黑板前
I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard

232
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:41,002
试图让学生们学会元素周期表
And trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.

233
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,013
我了解
Look, I understand.

234
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,001
你是有点点生疏
You're a little rusty, but you're

235
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,079
但你没看到好处
Not seeing the upside here...

236
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,066
你带来的新角度对我们非常有帮助
We could really benefit from a new set of eyes.

237
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,085
你知道吧
You know what it is when you been

238
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,062
当你花费几个月破解一个难题
Trying to crack some problem for months on end.

239
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,075
你的视角就会变得狭窄
You get tunnel vision.

240
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,012
正所谓旁观者清
One guy thinking outside of the box...

241
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:00,048
你恰恰是我们所需要的
You may be exactly what we need.

242
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,066
埃利奥特
Well, listen, Elliott...

243
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,023
你的提议很动人
Your offer is very appealing.

244
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,062
真的  谢谢
It really is. Thank you.

245
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:28,076
但有些事你要知道
There's something you should know.

246
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:33,006
我有些...
I have some...

247
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,060
个人事务
Personal issues.

248
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,001
没有什么不能解决的
Look, there's nothing we can't work out.

249
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:43,050
但是这有点复杂
Well, yeah, but it's complicated.

250
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,011
我们能帮助你
We can help you.

251
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,069
我们有很好的医疗保险
We have excellent health insurance.

252
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,079
最好的
The best.

253
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:17,050
你试过他们的
Hey, did you try those prosciutto wrapped figs?

254
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,047
意大利熏火腿没
They were like...wow.

255
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,010
太好吃  我大概吃了有30个
They were just... I must have had about 30 of those suckers.

256
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,024
还有海鲜桌  你看到没
And the seafood table. Did you see that?

257
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:28,013
有龙虾尾  蟹钳  虾
They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, shrimp.

258
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:35,040
你TM都对埃利奥特说什么了
What the hell did you say to Elliott?

259
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,053
你跟他说了我的癌症  对吧
You told him about the cancer, didn't you?

260
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:40,085
对吧
Didn't you?

261
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:42,061
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

262
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:45,030
好吧  我们是聊了一会儿
Okay, we were talking.

263
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,096
他问我关于你的情况  我很抱歉
He asked how you were doing, and I am sorry,

264
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,081
这阵子我可做不到喜怒不形于色
But I don't have the best poker face these days

265
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,026
特别是说到关键问题时候
Where that's concerned.

266
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:55,065
他知道你不对劲  是他追问我的
He knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me.

267
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,085
他追问你吗  简直胡说
He pressed you. Come on.

268
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,007
沃尔特
Walt!

269
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,078
在这个问题上
When it came right down to it,

270
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,052
我不知道除了告诉他事实外还能做什么
I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth.

271
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:06,051
事实  你干嘛不直接就说他很好
The truth? How about you just said "he's fine," huh?

272
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:10,088
如果你就跟他说
You think maybe you could've just have said that

273
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:12,037
他很好  不就完了吗
"He's fine," and that would be done.

274
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,036
我不喜欢你这种说话的态度
I don't like the way you're talking to me.

275
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:17,028
我不喜欢你跟别人说我的私事
I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs

276
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:20,088
跟那些已经远离我们生活的人说
To people who are not even in our lives anymore.

277
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:23,068
你到底跟他说了什么
What exactly did he say to you?

278
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:25,046
他想给我个工作
He offered me a job.

279
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:26,063
-什么  -就是那样
- What? - Yes.

280
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:29,004
就像块遮羞布  知道吗
Kind of like some fig leaf, you know?

281
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:32,012
想要保全我的面子
Some face-saving bullshit

282
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:35,028
好让我大方  接受他对我的施舍
That allowed me to generously accept his charity.

283
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,059
我拒绝他以后
And then, when I turned that down,

284
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,010
他就直接说愿意帮我付治疗费用
He flat-out offered to pay for my treatment.

285
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,080
这就是你想让他做的  不是吗
Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you?

286
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,028
-不是吗  -沃尔特  不是
- Didn't you?  - Walt. No.

287
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,011
-你就承认吧  -我没有让他
- Please. Come on. - I did not put him up...

288
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,092
好吧  那你说了什么
Okay, what did you say?

289
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,089
沃尔特
Walt?

290
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,052
你认为我会说什么
What do you think I said?

291
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,088
为什么  沃尔特
Why? Walt...

292
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,087
-准备走了吗  -我去乘公车
- You ready to go? - I'm taking the bus.

293
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:59,025
好的
Okay...

294
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:04,072
拜拜  亲爱的
Bye, honey.

295
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,035
嘿  伙计  这些是弹孔吗
Hey, dude, are these bullet holes?

296
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:50,043
不是  这些是用来
No, man. Those are for, like, you know,

297
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,009
通气的
Ventilation.

298
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,040
真酷啊
Cool.

299
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:59,004
不错的装备啊
Nice set-up, huh?

300
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,078
这没什么
This is nothing, man.

301
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:04,072
我以前有这两倍多的玻璃器皿
I used to have, like, twice as much glassware

302
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:09,064
直到我那以前的蠢货搭档把车开进了沟里
Until my dumbass ex-partner drove us into a ditch

303
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:11,065
多数都打破了
And wrecked most of it.

304
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:13,019
大号烧杯
Big ass beaker, huh?

305
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,077
等一下  不  这是个大号烧瓶
Wait, wait. No, that's a... yeah, that's a boiling flask.

306
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:19,057
这个才是烧杯
This is a beaker.

307
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:23,045
这是格里芬烧杯  这是容量瓶
Here's a griffin beaker, here's a volumetric beaker.

308
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:27,052
这是爱伦美氏锥形瓶
Here's an erlenmeyer flask.

309
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:31,088
哇  你懂得可真多
Wow. You really know your shit.

310
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,076
这些知识化学基本常识  哟
Well, it's just basic chemistry, yo.

311
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:39,066
你带东西来了吗
So... you got something for me?

312
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,055
哦 当然
Oh, hells, yeah!

313
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:56,007
好的  我们要开工了
Okay. We're in business.

314
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:59,044
-太好了  猴子  -伙计  看看这个
- Right on, Badger. - Dude, check this out.

315
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:04,034
老天啊  你带那个来干嘛
Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for?

316
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,079
打猎
Hunting.

317
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,095
我们可能会碰到野猪
We might see javelinas.

318
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:40,014
你到底要不要帮忙
Are you going to help me or what?

319
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,032
猴子
Badger!

320
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:52,099
给我点钱
Let me see the money.

321
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:57,026
一人5块  快点  再来两张
Nah, I need five each. Come on, two more.

322
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:59,080
给
Here.

323
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,037
他怎么样
What about him?

324
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:04,052
你在开玩笑吗  他看起来比我们小
Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.

325
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:06,031
随你的便
Whatever.

326
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,044
那个怎么样
What about that guy?

327
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:11,075
-他看上去像是做生意的  -那又怎么样
- Nah, he looks like a businessman. - So what?

328
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:14,090
生意人老是匆匆忙忙的
So, businessmen are always in a hurry.

329
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,061
他们好像一天到晚要去开会什么的
They're always, like, going to some meeting or something.

330
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:20,040
说真的  他肯定会拒绝
Seriously, he's just going to say no.

331
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,093
那个人
This guy.

332
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,031
就是他了
This is our guy.

333
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,089
你去
You're up.

334
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,082
为什么非让我去
Why do I have to do it?

335
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,089
你把拐杖给我  我就去
Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.

336
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,062
打扰一下
Excuse me, hey.

337
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:41,032
我们忘带身份证了  想问一下
We forgot our IDs and we were wondering

338
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:44,039
你能不能帮我们买一扎啤酒
If you could do us a favor and buy us a six-pack.

339
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,075
知道吗  你的要求违法
You know, what you're asking is illegal.

340
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:50,073
不  不违法
No, it's not?

341
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:52,075
它确实是
Yeah, it is.

342
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:55,010
哦  见鬼
Oh, shit.

343
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,048
我猜你中头奖了
Guess you win the jackpot.

344
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:04,006
我可不想就这样浪费我空闲的晚上
This is not how I wanted to spend my night off.

345
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,066
记住这是对你第一次也是最后一次警告
Consider this your first and last warning.

346
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,061
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

347
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,040
你很幸运有这么好的老爸
You're lucky you got a good dad here.

348
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,059
如果其他人不跑的话
If the other guys hadn't run,

349
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,024
我早就没事了
I could've talked my way out of it.

350
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:25,075
这么做太不明智了  不明智
Not cool, man. Not cool.

351
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:29,012
怎么  你像我这么大时没试过买啤酒吗
What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?

352
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:32,002
不  我是说你打电话给我而不是你老爸
No, I'm talking about you calling me and not your father.

353
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,039
你觉得他会怎么想
How do you think that will make him feel?

354
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,041
我都不知道要说你什么好
I don't even know what to say to you.

355
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:51,040
快点走开
Just go.

356
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,016
待会儿找你算账
I'll deal with you later.

357
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,099
沃尔特去哪了
Where's Walt?

358
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,053
我从早上就没见过他
I haven't seen him since this morning.

359
00:23:05,053 --> 00:23:07,053
知道的跟你差不多
Your guess is as good as mine.

360
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,062
帮我个忙  好吗
Listen, do me a favor, all right?

361
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:12,003
别告诉他孩子的事
Don't tell him about the kid.

362
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,083
不过是小孩子想买点啤酒罢了
Just a teenager trying to score some beer.

363
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:19,073
成长的烦恼
You know. Just growing pains.

364
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:22,004
他发现自己的老爸病了
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,

365
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:24,003
他想找点法子解脱
He starts acting out, you know.

366
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,024
先是大麻  现在又是这个
First the pot, and then this.

367
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:29,021
什么大麻
The pot?

368
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,018
你跟我说他抽大麻的
You told me he was smoking reefer.

369
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,078
是斯凯勒告诉我的
That's what's Skyler told me.

370
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,039
我是说  你就是这么暗示的
I mean, you may as well have.

371
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,039
我说的不是小沃尔特
I wasn't talking about Walter Jr.

372
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,006
我说的是沃尔特
I was talking about Walt.

373
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,024
你说什么
Excuse me?

374
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,006
他亲口承认的
He admitted it.

375
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:51,096
他说他喜欢
He said he liked it.

376
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:54,095
沃尔特
Walt?

377
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,051
我以为他不是那种人
I didn't think he had it in him.

378
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:09,049
最近他变了很多
It's like he's not himself lately.

379
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,064
有哪个神经正常的人
I mean, why would anyone in their right mind

380
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:14,035
会选择不接受治疗
Choose not to do treatment?

381
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,048
而且还有人愿意出所有的费用
Especially when it's completely paid for?

382
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:19,064
他为什么这么做
Why is he doing this?

383
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:22,007
知道我们该怎么做吗
You know what we need to do?

384
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,062
我们真正该做的是要让他坐下来
What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us,

385
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,099
开诚布公地跟他谈
And get everything out on the table.

386
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,087
好好地谈一谈
Talk it all through.

387
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:32,074
你是指我们来干扰他吗
You mean an intervention?

388
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:34,017
不是不是
No, no.

389
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:36,098
只是个家庭会议
Just a family meeting...

390
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:41,017
每个家庭成员都可以发表
Where everyone can voice their concerns and...

391
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:42,087
自己的意见
Be heard.

392
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,095
你太有才了  老兄
You are a genius, bro!

393
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:55,063
这次的成品太完美了
This cankenstein is unreal!

394
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,085
我们回去后就把美钞电版[假钞模具]毁掉
When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit.

395
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,097
我们可要发大财了
'Cause we're gonna make some mad dough!

396
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:03,083
不对
It's not right.

397
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,032
什么不对  你什么意思
What do you mean it's not right?

398
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:09,078
看上去很浑浊
It's... cloudy.

399
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:11,009
不应该是浑浊的样子
It's not supposed to be cloudy.

400
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,072
上次  是透明的
That last time, it was glass.

401
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,045
那又怎样
So what?

402
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:18,090
不管浑不浑浊  对我来说足够了
Cloudy, not cloudy, it looks good enough to me.

403
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,056
足够了
"Good enough."

404
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,097
喂  你干嘛啊
Yo, what are you doing?

405
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,040
你脑子进水了是吧  我还准备好好享用的呢
Are you out of your mind?  I totally would've smoked that!

406
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,061
不是给你的  是给我们客户的
Look, it's not for you, it's for our customers.

407
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,046
他们对成色有一定要求
They're gonna demand a certain standard.

408
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,078
什么
What?

409
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:45,035
你到底  什么
What are you... what?

410
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:47,001
我们再做一次
We'll just do it again...

411
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,024
直到合乎要求
Until we get it right.

412
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,021
沃尔特
Walt...

413
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:20,088
请坐  我们来谈谈
Please have a seat and join us.

414
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:13,044
还可以做得更纯
We can do better.

415
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:16,064
你TMD别做梦了
Don't you fucking think about it!

416
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,034
整整3磅假麻黄素就被你浪费了
Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted!

417
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,065
你知不知道我套着那个标志转了多久
You know how long I had to spin that stupid sign?

418
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,025
离我远点  神经病
Get off me, psycho!

419
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,093
又来这招  婊子
Helicopter, bitch!

420
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,045
混蛋
Asshole

421
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:48,055
开门
Open the door!

422
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:12,011
回来  你这婊子
Come back here, you bitch!

423
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:14,060
我要整死你
I'm gonna mess you up!

424
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:30,002
我真的要好好理解一下的你的想法
I really need to understand your thought

425
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,010
但很明显我不明白
Process because clearly I don't.

426
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,043
我感觉
I feel

427
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:37,062
你做的这个决定
That this decision you've made

428
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:40,006
不仅于你无益
Is not only not in your best interest,

429
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:43,067
而且有悖于我们整个家庭
It's not in the best interest of our entire family.

430
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,066
-听我说  斯凯勒  -我还没说完
- Look, Skyler... - Not yet. please.

431
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:49,095
我有一个发言枕
I have the talking pillow.

432
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:54,052
每个人都可以倾吐心声  记得吗
Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember?

433
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:56,063
接下来  该你了
And then, you'll get your chance.

434
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:01,079
钱对于我们来说总是个问题  我先声明
Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that.

435
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,085
但现在埃利奥特非常愿意帮我们忙
But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in,

436
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:08,050
我很清楚  你不怎么愿意接受帮助
I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help.

437
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,033
可能你一直就是这种性格
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

438
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:12,040
但是  亲爱的
But, honey...

439
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,075
偶尔依靠他人没什么不对的
It's okay to lean on people now and again.

440
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:19,041
你需要治疗
You need this treatment,

441
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,025
除了你自己
And nothing can stop you from getting it,

442
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:24,032
没有任何事阻止得了这个
Except you.

443
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:34,005
我可以答话吗
May I allowed to respond?

444
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,019
等一等
In a minute.

445
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:38,068
我们先轮着发言
I think we need to go around the circle first.

446
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,053
汉克  你开头好吗
Hank, would you like to start?

447
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:49,042
好的  行
Yeah. Okay.

448
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:53,089
-我要说的是  -等等  拿着发言枕
- Well, what I'll say is... - No, take the talking pillow.

449
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:02,010
是这样  听着  兄弟
All right, look, buddy.

450
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,056
我知道我说的话也许没什么分量  但是
I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but...

451
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,072
我很关心  很关心你
I care... about you...

452
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:13,083
非常非常关心
A hell of a lot.

453
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:16,010
这个癌症
This cancer thing...

454
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,075
我们  我们勇敢面对它吧
Let's just... let's face it.

455
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:20,099
你的遭遇确实很不幸
You know, you were dealt a shit hand.

456
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,060
但是
But...

457
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,099
运气也会改变的嘛
Sometimes your luck can change.

458
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:28,084
我是说  我都不知道讲了几遍了
I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know,

459
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:33,000
我从当初一无所有  到现在的美满生活
I started with a shit hand and I ended up with a full house.

460
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,026
明白吗
Okay?

461
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:37,017
我是说  关键就在于  你要坚强
I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there.

462
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,010
兄弟  你要心怀希望
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.

463
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,009
要心怀希望
Keep placing your bets.

464
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:46,009
汉克  你说的什么乱七八糟的
Hank... What the hell are you saying?

465
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:49,003
玛丽  让他说  我们就是来沟通的
Please, Marie, let him talk. That's what we're here to do.

466
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,056
让他说
Please.

467
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:53,068
继续吧  汉克
Go on, Hank.

468
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,079
好的
Right, well...

469
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,077
我们这么想问题  好吗
Look at it this way, okay?

470
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:01,073
打一场九局棒球赛  满垒了
It's the bottom of the 9th. Bases are loaded.

471
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:03,069
该你上场
You're up.

472
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,065
但是你的胳膊有毛病
But you got a bum arm. Right?

473
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,089
你根本没可能击出一个本垒打
There's no frickin' way you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

474
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:13,067
所以你要么让替补球员替你
So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat,

475
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:17,046
或者坚持下去  有尊严的输掉比赛
Or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game.

476
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,080
明白我说的了吗
Get what I'm saying?

477
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,058
没
No.

478
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,082
你想活出尊严来  这个我理解  兄弟
You got your pride, man. I get it. Okay?  I get it.

479
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,038
要是沃巴克斯老爹要出钱的话
If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, man,

480
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,006
我就赞同你老婆
I'm with your old lady on this one.

481
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,048
拿了钱就拍屁股走人
I say take the money and run, you know.

482
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:41,007
有人要拿这东西吗  给
Somebody want to take this thing?  Here.

483
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:42,075
嗯  沃尔特
Yes, Walter...

484
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:46,051
小沃尔特  你肯定
Walter Junior., I'm sure you have about

485
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:50,088
有一肚子话要说  也许吧  现在给你机会
A million things to say, probably, and now is your chance.

486
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:55,025
说吧  都说出来
Go ahead. just let it all out.

487
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,045
-全是扯蛋  -拜托
- This is bullshit. - Hey, come on.

488
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,049
没事的
It's all right.

489
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:08,037
讲啊
Talk.

490
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:10,080
告诉爸爸你的感受
Tell your Dad how you feel.

491
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:16,073
-烦着呢  -告诉他
- I'm pissed off. - Tell him.

492
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:19,072
我烦得要死
I'm pissed off,

493
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:22,053
因为你就
'Cause you're being...

494
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:25,012
你就像
You're...

495
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:29,041
就像个懦夫
You're a pussy.

496
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:33,021
你看上去像是  准备好了放弃
You're, like, ready to give up.

497
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:42,014
天  你要是也放弃我怎么办
God. What if you gave up on me, huh?

498
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,032
看这个  我都经历过这么多
This here?  All the stuff I've been through,

499
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:56,055
而你却怕那小儿科的化疗
And you're scared of a little chemotherapy?

500
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:13,083
我  个人立场
Me, personally

501
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:18,069
我认为应该由你自己来选择
I think you should do whatever you want to do.

502
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,097
什么
What?

503
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:25,044
你说过我们要诚实的表达心里的想法
You told us to be honest about our feelings.

504
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,060
是沃尔特得了癌症  就该由他自己决断
Walt's the one with cancer. It's his decision.

505
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,046
我们任何人都不能喧宾夺主
It's not up to any of us.

506
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:34,021
你为什么要搞鬼乱来
Why in the hell would you do this?

507
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:37,097
我并不是一直打算要袒护沃尔特
I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.

508
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:39,087
但是坐在这听你们说了这么久
But after sitting here and listening to you all

509
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:42,059
谈论他的将来  像是他没有发言权似的
Talk about his future like he has no say in it.

510
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,079
要是他不去治病
He's not gonna have a future

511
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,058
他就不会有将来
If he doesn't get treatment.

512
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:49,041
我可是专业医疗人员
I am a medical professional.

513
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:53,096
我每天给治疗中的病人照X光
I X-Ray people in treatment every day.

514
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:56,017
我每天都见到他们  你知道吗
I see them every day, and you know what?

515
00:33:56,017 --> 00:34:00,028
有些人真的是非常的痛苦
Some of them are absolutely miserable.

516
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:02,064
-玛丽   -对不起  但这是事实
- Marie...  - I'm sorry, but it's true.

517
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:05,064
有些人并不愿意
And some of them don't wanna spend

518
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:08,045
将他们最后的日子
Their last weeks or months

519
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,087
无味地跟医生消磨耗尽
Being picked at by doctors.

520
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:13,062
而他们都是被家人劝说进医院的
But they got talked into it by their families.

521
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:16,020
能把发言枕还我吗  我同意玛丽的话
Could I get the pillow back? I agree with Marie on that.

522
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,010
-汉克  -什么  也许沃尔特想死得其所
- Hank - What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man.

523
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,042
可我不想让他死
I don't want him to die at all!

524
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:25,088
这才是关键问题  要么帮忙要么走人
That's the whole point of this. So either help, or leave!

525
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:28,092
斯凯勒  我只是好意地
Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy

526
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:31,029
告诉你我的真实想法
Of giving you my honest opinion.

527
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,001
玛丽  这又不是辩论会
You know, Marie, this is not debate club.

528
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,087
这是我丈夫的命
This is my husband's life.

529
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:40,054
我做个简单的观察
I make one simple observation...

530
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,023
-我丈夫的命  -我们正在讨论这事
- My husband's life - We're talking about!

531
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:45,059
-女士们  别吵了  -你怎么能
- Ladies. come on. - How dare you...

532
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,098
这太蠢了
This is so stupid.

533
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:58,034
行了  我现在拿到发言枕了
All right, I've got the talking pillow now.

534
00:34:58,034 --> 00:35:00,076
好了吗
Okay?

535
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:14,036
在坐的各位
We all, in this room,

536
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:16,055
我们都深爱着彼此
We love each other.

537
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:20,082
我们希望对彼此都好的决定  我也明白
We want what's best for each other, and I know that.

538
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:23,081
我非常感激你们
I am very thankful for that.

539
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:26,047
可是
But...

540
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,062
我想要的
What I want...

541
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:33,083
我所想的  我所要的
What I want, what I need,

542
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:38,018
是一次选择
Is a choice.

543
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:42,038
那是什么意思
What does that... mean?

544
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:48,080
有时候  我觉得自己从没有
Sometimes, I feel like I never actually

545
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,069
为我自己而活
Make any of my own.

546
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,088
选择  我的意思是
Choices, I mean.

547
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:03,083
我这一生
My entire life,

548
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:07,023
似乎从未
It just seems I never...

549
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:13,072
真正选择过
You know, had a kind of real say about any of it.

550
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:20,046
现在最后的选择来了  癌症
Now this last one, cancer...

551
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:26,070
我唯一能做的选择是如何面对癌症
All I have left is how I choose to approach this.

552
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,044
沃尔特  那就做个正确的选择
Then make the right choice, Walt.

553
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:33,027
你不是唯一得癌症的人
You're not the only one it affects.

554
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:36,047
你的儿子怎么办
What about your son?

555
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:41,056
你不想看着你女儿长大成人吗  我只是
Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up? I just...

556
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,070
当然  我当然想
Of course, I do.

557
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:55,017
斯凯勒  你也看过统计数据了
Skyler, you've read the statistics.

558
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,049
那些医生们
These doctors...

559
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:05,056
讨论着我还能活的时间
Talking about surviving.

560
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,068
一年还是两年
One year, two years,

561
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:10,018
就好像这是唯一重要的事一样
Like it's the only thing that matters.

562
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:13,030
而活着又能怎样呢  仅仅是活着
But what good is it, to just survive

563
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,006
要是我病得不能工作
If I am too sick to work,

564
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:20,057
不能享受美食
To enjoy a meal,

565
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:26,013
不能做爱
To make love?

566
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:34,091
我想在我剩下的日子里
For what time I have left,

567
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,050
住在自己的家里
I want to live in my own house.

568
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,047
睡在自己的床上
I want to sleep in my own bed.

569
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:46,060
我不想每天咽下30还是40片药
I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day,

570
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,096
又是脱发  到处掩饰
Lose my hair, and lie around,

571
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:51,094
又是卧床不起
Too tired to get up...

572
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,033
反胃得连脑袋都不能动
And so nauseated that I can't even move my head.

573
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:05,055
你就成天守在榻前伺候我吗
And you cleaning up after me?

574
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:10,022
我
Me, with...

575
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:16,053
和死人  和靠人工维持生命的人
Some dead man, some artificially alive,

576
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:20,053
有什么区别
Just marking time?

577
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:24,028
不  不
No. No.

578
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,088
而你就会记得那样的我
And that's how you would remember me.

579
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,052
这是我最不愿意的
That's the worst part.

580
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,045
那么
So...

581
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:48,029
斯凯勒  这就是我所考虑的
That is my thought process, Skyler.

582
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,024
对不起
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:54,056
我只是
I just...

584
00:38:56,034 --> 00:39:00,025
我选择顺其自然
I choose not to do it.

585
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:57,017
好吧
All right.

586
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:02,009
什么好吧
All right what?

587
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,008
我会接受治疗
I'll do the treatment.

588
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:41,005
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

589
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:11,060
账单室的女士说
The lady from the billing office said

590
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,010
他们一般直接给保险公司开账单
They usually bill the insurance company directly,

591
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,094
不过  既然我们的医疗保险不付钱
But since our HMO is not paying for it,

592
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:19,027
我们可以用信用卡付
We can pay up front with a credit card.

593
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:21,001
好
Good.

594
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:26,029
埃利奥特会寄张支票来
And then Elliott will send a check.

595
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,087
我会处理好的
I will take care of it.

596
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,050
沃尔特·怀特
Walter White?

597
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,015
是我
Yes.

598
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:42,050
好
Okay.

599
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:46,066
一会儿见
See you in a minute.

600
00:44:17,078 --> 00:44:19,066
埃利奥特
Elliott.

601
00:44:19,066 --> 00:44:22,027
沃尔特  我是格蕾琴
Walt, it's Gretchen.

602
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,081
你好
Oh, hey.

603
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,069
格蕾琴  你还好吗
Hey, Gretchen. How are you?

604
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:31,056
那天见到你们可真高兴
You know, it was really great seeing you two the other day.

605
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:33,073
多令人高兴的聚会
What a party.

606
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:38,046
埃利奥特跟我说了癌症的事
Elliott told me about the cancer.

607
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:41,022
我非常遗憾
I'm so sorry.

608
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:47,076
你知道  也就是那样了
Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess.

609
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:51,023
我会永远支持你
I don't know what to say except

610
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,084
除了这个我也不知道该说什么
I'm always here for you.

611
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:56,094
我们都  我们都想对你说这句话
