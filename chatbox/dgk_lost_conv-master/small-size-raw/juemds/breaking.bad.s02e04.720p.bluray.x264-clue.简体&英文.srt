美国船长
Captain America.

14
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,078
-你好  兄弟  -你好  兄弟
- What's up, brother?  - Hey, bro.

15
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,039
这主意太蠢了
This is stupid.

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,007
你有更好的主意吗
You got a better idea?

17
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,019
好吧  无所谓了
Okay, fine. Whatever.

18
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:22,043
那我们什么时候
So when do we, you know?

19
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,072
暂时不动手
We don't, for now.

20
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,087
等一切安顿好了再开始制毒
No cooking until things settle down.

21
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,016
安顿
Settle down?

22
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,083
你不是说事情不会有变化吗
I thought you're the one that said nothing's changed.

23
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,049
听着  我让家人担惊受怕深受折磨
Look, I just put my family through an ordeal

24
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,096
他们才刚开始接受我的现状  明白吗
That they're just now starting to accept, okay?

25
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,038
我不能
I can't...

26
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,035
这个太贵了
Ah, that's too expensive.

27
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,017
听着  我离家超过20分钟
Look, I can't leave my house

28
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,062
我老婆就开始担心
For more than 20 minutes without my wife worrying.

29
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,083
我需要时间来改善我们的关系
I need time to mend fences.

30
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,084
你要改善关系  那我怎么办
So while you're fixing fences,what about me, huh?

31
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:04,059
你那个混蛋小舅子把我的钱都收走了
Your A-hole brother-in-law took all my money.

32
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,062
这里有600块
That's $600.

33
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,097
剩下的那些钱呢
What about the rest?

34
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,086
-什么  -你那一半钱都是我的
- Rest of what?  - Half your money's mine.

35
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:27,021
说好55分成的  这不是你的生意经吗
You know,50/50 partners.That's your business motto.

36
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:30,047
你这么说什么意思  你犯错  我买单吗
Meaning what, exactly?That I suffer for your carelessness?

37
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,015
是你想跟屠库合作
You're the one who wanted to work with Tuco.

38
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,092
要不是因为这个  就不会搞成这样
If it weren't for that, none of this would've happened.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,060
稍后再谈  好吗
We'll talk about this later, okay?

40
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:49,013
目前就不要联系了  明白吗
As for now, no contact. Understood?

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,063
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

42
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,032
我先走
I leave first.

43
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,033
沃尔特
Walt!

44
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,027
在厨房呢
In the kitchen.

45
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,041
你怎么还动起了炉子
I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.

46
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,009
搞笑呢  葛罗卓[名小丑]
Hilarious, Groucho.

47
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,032
去吧  快坐下
Go on, grab a seat.

48
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,002
桌上有果汁
Juice is on the table.

49
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,008
-早上好  宝贝儿  -嗨  妈妈
- Good morning, honey.  - Hey, Mom.

50
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,042
老爸正做早饭呢
Dad's cooking breakfast.

51
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,077
放心  盘子我也由我来洗
But don't worry.I'm also doing all the dishes.

52
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,025
不错吧  跟我来
Nice? Follow me.

53
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,034
还有橙汁和葡萄柚汁
There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice,

54
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,000
虽然我并不喜欢喝这些
Which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of.

55
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,086
但是考虑到他们富含多酚
But considering all the polyphenols

56
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,092
还有纤维蛋白  对人体无害
And the albuminoids, can't hurt.

57
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,091
沃尔特  你不必这么做
Walt,You didn't have to do this.

58
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,009
-葡萄柚汁要吗  -好的  谢谢
- Grapefruit juice?  - Yes, please. Thanks.

59
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:30,061
好了  宝贝  你要吗
There you go. Honey?

60
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,014
我喝橙汁  谢谢
I'll stick with orange, thank you.

61
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,068
好了  开吃吧  开吃吧
All right. Dig in, dig in.

62
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,089
不然薄煎饼凉了
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

63
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,084
好吧  我知道了  斯蒂利·丹[乐队]
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

64
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,027
-不是  -肯定是
- No.  - Yes, absolutely.

65
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,026
不  在纯音乐才能方面
No, in terms of pure musicianship,

66
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,086
他们比你知道的任何现代乐队都强
I would put them up against any current band you could name.

67
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,034
你压根不知道什么现代乐队
You wouldn't know any current bands.

68
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,088
-跑题了  -宝贝  祝你愉快
- That's besides the point.  - Have a good day, honey.

69
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,015
你也是
You too.

70
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,081
伯兹史卡斯  我想起一个
Boz Scaggs.There's another one.

71
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,002
管他们是谁呢
Whoever they are.

72
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,087
拜拜啦  谢谢你的早餐
Bye,thanks for breakfast.

73
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:12,030
不客气  让路易斯小心开车  知道吗
You're welcome. Tell Louis to drive carefully, will you?

74
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,006
好
All right.

75
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,064
我们儿子竟然没听说过伯兹史卡斯
Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.

76
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,082
我们做父母的真失败
We have failed as parents.

77
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,056
仔细想想  我也不知道伯兹史卡斯
Come to think of it, I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.

78
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,035
得了吧
Stop it.

79
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:29,067
把你的盘子给我  我来  我来
Give me your plate. I'll get it. I'll get it.

80
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,059
谢谢
Thank you.

81
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,011
听着
Hey, listen,

82
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,060
日历上标明
In the calendar section,

83
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,017
这一周
All week long,

84
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,063
在新墨西哥大学有个小说作者研讨会
There's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM.

85
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,047
讨论如何出版
And, you know, probably talking about how to get published

86
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,020
之类的事情
and that sort of thing.

87
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,088
总之  我以为你会去
You know, so, anyway, I thought maybe you might...

88
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,025
如果你去的话  我陪着你
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

89
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:17,055
我还想了想的那晚你问我的事情
And I was thinking about what you asked me the other night.

90
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,098
你怀疑我还有一部手机
You know, you were wondering if I had a second cell phone.

91
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,085
我一直都在想这件事
And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot,

92
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,083
我觉得你听到的
And I think what you heard

93
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,085
是我设的手机闹铃
Was my cell phone alarm going off.

94
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:35,019
我之前一直用闹铃当做治疗提醒
I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder to...

95
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,016
提醒我吃药
Well, remind me to take my medication.

96
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,089
诡异的是
And the weird thing is that

97
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,034
闹铃的声音跟电话铃声
The alarm sound is almost exactly the same

98
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,081
一模一样
As the regular phone ring,

99
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,054
说起这一点  设计得真不人性化
Which is really a poor design, if you ask me.

100
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,081
事情可能就是这样的
But I think that was probably it.

101
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:58,011
我试过把铃声改掉
I tried to go in and change it to a different sound,

102
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,045
改成不同的声音  但是...
Other than the phone ring, but...

103
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:03,001
这些玩意儿太复杂了
They so overcomplicate these things.

104
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,019
总之
Anyway,

105
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,040
正好我也把手机弄丢了
It was probably just as well that I lost it.

106
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,014
市场上应该又有新型的手机了
There's got to be a new one on the market by now.

107
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,026
如果我们一起去新墨西哥大学的话
You know, if we do this thing at UNM,

108
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,046
回来的路上
Maybe on the way home,

109
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:19,013
我们可以顺道给我买部新手机
We can stop by,and I can get a new cell phone.

110
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,028
斯凯勒
Skyler

111
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,020
斯凯勒

112
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,050

113
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,007
准备好了
Ready?

114
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,037
你能帮个屁忙啊
Yo, for what might help.

115
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,090
不会又是劝说会吧
Not another intervention.

116
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,018
杰西·布鲁斯·平克曼
Jesse Bruce Pinkman,

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,097
根据新墨西哥不动产法47章第8条第13项
Pursuant to Section 47-8-13 of the New Mexico Real Property Code,

118
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,076
现通知你搬出
You are hereby given notice to vacate

The premises listed as 9809 Margo,Albuquerque,87104.

120
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,071
等等  什么
Wait. What?

121
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,023
你要把我从我自己房子赶出去
You're kicking me out of my own house?

122
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,058
是你姑妈琪妮的房子
It's your aunt Ginny's house.

123
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,028
-她送给我了  -杰西  她可没送给你
- She gave it to me.  - She never gavet to you, Jesse.

124
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:17,051
你只是享有居住权
You were allowed residentiary privileges.

125
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:20,012
你父母才是房屋所有权持有人
Your parents have always been the property owners.

126
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,078
听着  我们之前谈过  好吗
Look, we talked about this, okay?

127
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,092
我把房子卖了  五五分成
I'd sell the house, we'd split it 50/50.

128
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,047
都说好了  又他妈搞什么啊
That was the deal. What the hell happened?

129
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,020
问题是你在房子里制毒
What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.

130
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,072
不  我没有  什么
No, I'm not. What?

131
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:36,039
杰西  缉毒局的探员过来找过你
A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.

132
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,067
他找到我们家来了
He came to our front door.

133
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,032
好吧...
Okay...

134
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:46,039
实际上我一直在协助他们
Because I've actually been helping them,

135
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:49,046
告诉你们的话就会有太多麻烦
Which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you,

136
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,032
你们不要谢我
So you're welcome.

137
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,074
我看过地下室
I saw your basement.

138
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,099
我有点担心
I was worried,

139
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,027
所以我过去看了看
So I went over there and I let myself in,

140
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:05,000
发现了你的实验室
And I found your laboratory.

141
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:09,080
你们竟然有钥匙
You guys have your own key?

142
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:20,073
生产二级管制药物
Manufacture of a Schedule II controlled substance

143
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:23,054
是二等重罪
Is a second-degree felony.

144
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,031
根据联邦财产冻结法
Under federal asset seizure,

145
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:29,055
政府有权没收你的房子
The government can take the entire house.

146
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,097
东西已经不在那里了
It's not even there anymore.

147
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,081
我都清理出去了
I cleaned it all out.

148
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:36,056
儿子  你想毁掉自己的一生  我们也没办法
Son, we can't stop you from ruining your life,

149
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,074
但你不能拖我们下水
But you will not drag us down with you.

150
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,086
72小时内搬出房子
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

151
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,069
否则  你父母授权我可以通知相关部门
Otherwise, your parents have authorized me to contact the authorities.

152
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:48,072
清楚了吗
Is that clear?

153
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,066
还有什么疑问吗

For what it's worth, I was thinking about going back to those meetings,

163
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,026

你没接电话
You don't answer your phone?

00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,066
听着
Hey, listen.

176
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:03,033
我一直在想
So I've been thinking a lot about our...

177
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,074
我们那天的谈话
Conversation we had the other day,

178
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:08,038
我终于明白
And I completely get why

179
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,093
爸爸要那么鞭策我的原因了
Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and...

180
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,094
杰西  不只是你爸爸这么想
It's not just your father, Jesse.

181
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,092
我明白  明白
I know. I know.

182
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,018
我只想说
I'm just saying it's a really,

183
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,079
我醒悟了不少
really big wake-up call for me,

184
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,093
所以我想跟你谈谈
Which is why I wanted to talk to you.

185
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:28,020
事实上  我一直在考虑去商业学校念书的事
I've been thinking real seriously about business school, actually,

186
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,041
所有事情都可以在电脑上搞定
And you can do the whole thing from your computer now, and...

187
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:34,054
不  妈妈  这是件好事
No, Mom, Mom. Hey, this is good.

188
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,093
我们用心交流
You know, we're talking,

189
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,077
好好谈谈
Starting a dialogue.

190
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,007
杰西  一切都晚了
The time for talking has passed, Jesse.

191
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:47,043
搞什么啊
What the hell, yo?

192
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,015
我以为你们只是想提醒我
I thought it was just a wake-up call.

193
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,075
我们把这些都放在仓库
We are putting it in storage.

194
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:53,027
等你真正成熟了  可以要回去
When you decide to grow up, you can have it back.

195
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,071
你怎么不成熟点呢  妈妈
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

196
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,009
琪妮想我待在这里  我才是那个一直照顾她的人
Ginny wanted me here.I was the one who took care of her.

197
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:02,033
我带她去看医生  每天给她做午饭
I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day.

198
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,005
这房子是我应得的
I earned this!

199
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:06,034
你并没有每天给她做午饭
You did not make her lunch every day.

200
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,021
你又做什么了呢
What did you do, huh?

201
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:11,016
她躺在那儿等死  你他妈在哪儿呢
She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?

202
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,051
别跟我来劲
Don't start with me.

203
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:13,063
现在呢
Now what,

204
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:17,014
你狠心把你大儿子扫地出门
You've decided to, I don't know, make your eldest son homeless?

205
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,092
真是和谐家庭啊
Great family, Mom!

206
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,087
你为什么要这样
Why are you like this?

207

Leave them on the kitchen counter when you leave.

211
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,086
不要  妈妈
No, Mom! Mom!

212
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,082
我能去哪儿呢
Where am I supposed to go?

213
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,012

这么做就能帮上大忙了啊
This is gonna help big time with that.

217
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,031
贱人
Bitch!

你不能同时踩在两个踏板上
You can't use one foot on each pedal.

373

-为什么不行  -因为不可以  停车  沃尔特  明白吗

Come on,there's the easy way,and then there's the right way, right?

我的腿不好使
My legs don't work that way.

你的腿很好  只要坚持一下
Your legs are fine. You just have to stick with it.

这么停车也行
That's one way to stop.

403
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,014

410
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:17,089
你表弟猴子  记得吗
Your cousin Badger, remember?

411
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,096
你来这干什么
What the hell you doing here?

412
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,082
臭死了你
You smell like shit.

413
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:23,058
说来话长
It's a long story.

414
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,093
我帮你把这破车修好了
So I fixed up your felonious rolling laboratory here.

415
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,062
花费750块
$750 for the repair.

416
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:31,065
加上厕所就是1000  你另外还欠我500
Make it a grand,counting the toilet,plus the $500 you already owe me,

417
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:34,040
付清后  你可以滚得远远的了
And you're good to drive on out of here to someplace far away,

418
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:36,028

Upwind.

419
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,050
事情是这样的
Here's the thing.

420
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:42,049
今天给不了钱
I can't pay you today.

1750块
$1,750?

423
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:49,046
就算是1750块吧  算上
We'll make it $1,750 for, like...

424
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,079

425
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,049
-我以为你说话算数呢  -当然
- I thought your word was your bond.  - It totally is.

426
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:57,096
只不过我现在手头没钱
Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment.

427
00:33:58,046 --> 00:34:00,065
很快就会有了
But I will, soon.

428
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,063
我是这么想的
Here's my counter-offer.

429
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:07,023
你滚出去  这些东西卖了钱抵债
I kick you out.I take payment from your inventory.

430
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:10,022
我认识一个人专门收这种破烂
I know a guy that'll pay premium for this kind of crap.

431
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:12,001
好吧  2000块

Two days, 2 grand.

433
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,087
公平交易
That's totally fair.

434
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,028
别把我东西卖了
Just don't take my cook stuff.

435
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,006
好吗  我就剩这些家当了
All right? That's all I got left.

436
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,079
求你了  好吗  我真的
Please, all right? I really...

437
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,095
真的需要
God, I really need

438
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,064
缓一缓
A break here.

440
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:57,067
不知道  里面有不少东西
I don't know.There's a bunch of stuff in there.

441
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:00,099
还有叫什么甲胺的东西
There's something called methylamine. Me... Meth...

442
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,056
管它叫什么呢  甲胺

00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:07,014
不清楚  我掂量了下  应该是满的
I don't know. I banged on it.It sounds pretty full to me.

444
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:15,042
我靠  多少钱
Holy shit. How much?

445
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:09,004
路易斯载沃尔特上学去了
Louis took Walt to school.

446
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,071
我在想
I was thinking maybe...

447
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,077
我们可以趁机好好谈谈
This would be a good time to talk.

448
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,045
我曾梦见拥有一个古董修车铺

是很奇怪
Sounds weird.

452
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,067
我想道歉

总不在家

458
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,022
癌症不是所有事情的借口

我不是一个称职的丈夫
I haven't been a good partner to you,

460

And for that...

老天

你还想冷战都什么时候

不跟我说话
Not talking to me.

成天出门  也不告诉我去哪儿
Going out all day and refusing to tell me where.

475
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,084
我肯定生我的气了
You are obviously angry with me about something,

476
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:52,073
所以说出来吧
So let's talk about it.

477
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
老天

我感觉到你对我不满
I feel like you're upset with me

479
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:08,020

是这个吗  你这么认为吗
Is that it? Is that what you think?

484
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:22,072
所以你才问我
Is that why you asked me about the...

485
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:26,009
是不是还有部手机  因为你认为我不忠
Some other phone? Because you think that I'm being unfaithful?

486
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,054
不知道
I don't know.

487
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,002

我怎么才能证明给你看呢

抱歉  先从
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts...

523
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,026
我父母的贪得无厌开始说吧

没事  我很抱歉  只是

529
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:17,055
要是斯凯勒看到你了呢

530
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,005
那怎么办呢  到时怎么办呢  天才

531
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,013
-不知道  -知道你为什么不知道吗
- I don't know.  - You know why you don't know?

532
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:25,036
因为你不动脑子  这就是原因

根本没有你的那份钱

那些都是我的钱  明白吗
There is only my all of it.Do you understand?

539
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:43,083
我凭什么为你的冒失买单
Why should I be penalized because of your sloppiness?

540
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:46,002
听着  这样就不行  好吗
Look, that is completely uncool, all right?

541
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:49,060
-说好五五分成的搭档嘛  -什么搭档
- We agreed, 50/50 partners.  - Partners in what?

542
00:42:49,073 --> 00:42:52,067
你做了什么  我问问你
What exactly do you do here? I've been meaning to ask

543
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,076
因为一直都是我在制毒

我制毒  你不过是个瘾君子

笨到连
