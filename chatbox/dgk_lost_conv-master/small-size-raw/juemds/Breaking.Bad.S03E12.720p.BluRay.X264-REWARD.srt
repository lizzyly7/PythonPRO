嘿  伙计们
Hi, guys.

10
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:36,023
绝

第十二集

16
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,025
如果可以的话
So if it's okay,

17
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,047
我想开这辆车去考驾照
I was thinking about using this one for the test.

18
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,064
老妈的车的刹车太难搞了
Mom's brakes are very sticky--

19
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,074
你轻轻踩一下
and you barely press down on them,

20
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,024
就会有尖锐的刹车声
and it's like a screech.

21
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,031
当然可以
Sure.

22
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,002
我开的还可以吗
But I'm good?

23
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,069
是的  你开得不错
Yeah, you're great.

24
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,015
怎么了
Why?

25
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,016
我的脚没关系吗
Um, are my feet okay?

26
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,036
-哦  -我查过了
- Ah. - I looked it up.

27
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,083
新墨西哥州规定说
New Mexico says

28
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,070
我只需开个医生证明就行了
all I need is a note from a doctor.

29
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,074
我知道这根本不是什么正道
I mean, I know it's not the right way and all,

30
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,097
可是一旦我有了临时执照
but once I get my provisional,

31
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,047
我就能一直用下去
I can keep working at it.

32
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,011
只要你能注意行车安全
Well, as long as it gets you safely from point A to point B,

33
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:39,015
那我干嘛要反对呢
then who am I to argue?

34
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,096
洗钱  维基百科  免费的百科全书
Money laundering. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

35
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:50,069
嗨
Hi.

36
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:54,003
你是个可爱的小女孩  你真可爱
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.

37
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:56,006
洗钱的现代发展史

38
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,006
你真可爱哦  太可爱了
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

39
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,083
我知道了
I know.

40
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,083
资金的提供

41
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,083
我知道了
I know.

42
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,035
-给你双拐  -给你钥匙
- There you go. - Here you go.

43
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,075
好的
All right.

44
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,049
谢谢
Thank you.

45
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,072
-好了吗  -是的
- Got it? - Yeah.

46
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,023
好  好了
Okay. All right.

47
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:27,033
是周六早上9点考吗
So 9 A.M. Saturday?

48
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,093
周六早上9点
9 A.M. Saturday.

49
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,003
那你8点半来接我
So, which means pick me up about 8:30.

50
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:32,053
我会满怀热情的出现在这里的
I'll be here with bells on.

51
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:34,007
什么
What?

52
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,054
我就这么一说
Just a saying.

53
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,077
别担心  我不会穿着喇叭裤来的
Don't worry. I won't be wearing bells.

54
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,084
-嘿  -嘿  妈
- Hey. - Hey, Mom.

55
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,098
-你有时间吗  -有
- Hi. Um, do you have a minute? - Yeah.

56
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,072
你能进去替我照看一下你妹妹吗
Could you go in and keep an eye on your sister for me?

57
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,095
好的  当然可以
Yeah, sure.

58
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,001
-谢谢  -很好  -再见  老爸
- Thanks. - All right. - See you, Dad.

59
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,065
再见  儿子  对了  今天表现不错
Bye, son. Hey, good work today.

60
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,085
谢谢
Thank you.

61
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,079
你有再想过我们讨论的事情吗
Have you thought anymore about what we discussed?

62
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:02,033
"再想过"  意思是重新考虑吗
"Thought any more," Meaning reconsidered?

63
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,040
没有
No.

64
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,083
那你就告诉我哪个地方不行
So show me the flaw in it.

65
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,090
是"很多个地方"  斯凯勒
Uh, "Flaws," Skyler.

66
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:11,044
"很多地方"  是复数  不是单数
"Flaws," plural, not singular.

67
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,024
你要我从何说起呢
Where do you want me to start?

68
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,065
我很讨厌现在的状况  好吗
Hey, I don't love this situation, all right,

69
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,055
是你拖我下水的
that you put me in.

70
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,015
不管怎样  我们还是接着说点有用的吧
However, let's just stick with what makes sense here.

71
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,092
你拿了本钱  去赌博
You took the seed money. You went gambling.

72
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,027
然后把钱投到了洗车生意上
You invested it in the car wash

73
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,076
经营了四年的时间
that you helped run for four years.

74
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,039
你雇了你老婆来做会计
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper.

75
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:34,030
你猜为什么  因为她真是个会计
Because guess what? She's actually a bookkeeper.

76
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,016
这才是审计员会相信的故事
Now, that is a story an auditor can believe,

77
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,067
我有漏掉些什么吗
so what am I missing?

78
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,077
你漏掉了这种选择
You're missing

79
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:41,008
那就是  你只是接受了我给你的这笔钱
that you should just take this money that I give you

80
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,004
但并没有仔细查看过有多少
and not look too closely at it,

81
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:47,068
因为如果哪天我被抓了  但愿不会
so if, God forbid, I get caught,

82
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,061
你依然能洗脱嫌疑
you maintain plausible deniability.

83
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:53,018
那照你这说法  你我关系不和
Okay, my estranged husband

84
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,058
在你还在工作那会儿
who, when he was working,

85
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,079
每年能挣43000美元
made $43,000 a year,

86
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,062
然后突然你开始把所有钱都给我
starts shoveling money at me,

87
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,070
然后你指望警察找我的时候
and when the police come,

88
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,022
我这样说吗
I'm supposed to say,

89
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,042
"天啊  我从没仔细想过  警官
"Gee, I never thought about it, officers.

90
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,063
我当时并没觉得有什么不对劲"
Made sense to me."

91
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:08,056
你真觉得我能靠这样洗脱嫌疑吗
Really? That, in your mind, is plausible deniability?

92
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,017
我直说了吧  沃尔特
I'll tell you what, Walt.

93
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,030
我倒宁愿他们把我
I'd rather have them

94
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,050
当成那个叫什么邦妮的女人
think I'm Bonnie what's-her-name

95
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,014
电影《雌雄大盗》里的女主角  女骗子

96
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,014
而不是一个十足的傻瓜
than some complete idiot.

97
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:20,091
那你这是在提出警告了
So you're promoting caution here.

98
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:26,058
想要一个可信的故事
And you want a believable story.

99
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:28,088
在我看来
That, it seems to me,

100
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:33,035
那才是应付目前最为稳妥的办法
is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation,

101
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,082
就是这样
yes.

102
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:41,032
不过我在你的故事里发现了一个小漏洞
But I'm noting a little hole in your plot, though.

103
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:43,094
既然你丈夫与你不和
Why would your estranged husband

104
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:46,030
那他为什么要为你做这些事呢
be doing all this for you?

105
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:50,060
因为他爱他的家庭
Because he loves his family

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,068
而且非常想要和解
and desperately wants a reconciliation,

107
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:57,075
虽然绝不可能
though it may be hopeless and futile.

108
00:06:57,078 --> 00:07:00,098
但他却愿意为此付出一切努力
Then again, he'd try anything.

109
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,012
恕我无法相信
I'm just not buying it.

110
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,048
我觉得如果夫妻之间关系有所改善的话
No, I think it would be better

111
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,063
故事会更有说服力
if the husband were no longer estranged.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,004
你知道
You know,

113
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:16,070
如果他能睡回到他的床上去的话
maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.

114
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:19,017
哇哦
Wow.

115
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,014
你在做白日梦吗
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

116
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:29,044
我至少得成为这家人的一部分
I am at least going to be a part of this household.

117
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,045
我要每天与家人一起晚餐
Dinner with the family every night of the week.

118
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,065
不能每晚都来  不可能
Not every night, no.

119
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,005
一周六顿晚餐  你有一个晚上的空闲
Six nights a week. You'll get one night off.

120
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,042
两顿晚餐  不能在周末
Dinner two nights, not weekends,

121
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,052
提前一天通知
with 24-hours' notice.

122
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:43,059
一周五顿晚餐  不需要提前通知
Five nights a week with no notice.

123
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,093
三顿  提前六小时通知
Three, six-hours' notice.

124
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:48,026
五顿晚餐  提前两小时通知
Five nights a week with two hours' notice.

125
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,030
四顿
Four. F--

126
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,073
你给我适可而止
Don't push it.

127
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,044
我要房子的钥匙
And I want my own key to the house.

128
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,050
没必要
No.

129
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,077
以防急用还有面子问题  所以当然有必要
For emergencies and appearances, yes.

130
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,088
我得照看女儿
I am going to babysit my own daughter.

131
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:02,084
督促儿子做作业
I'm going to help my son with his homework.

132
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,001
我是家庭的一份子
I am going to be a part of this family,

133
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:08,032
只有这样  你编的这故事才有说服力
and that is how we'll sell your little fiction.

134
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:36,031
休息一下  出去喝一杯怎么样
How about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer?

135
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:45,091
谢了  不用了
Uh, no. Thanks, though.

136
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,086
改天吧
Maybe some other time.

137
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:51,053
我认真的  跟我喝一杯
No, seriously. Get a beer with me.

138
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,080
说吧
What?

139
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:25,056
你搞什么
What the hell are you doing?

140
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:28,033
是我们的货  对吧
That's ours, right?

141
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,060
好好看看  是我们的吗
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

142
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:40,038
没错  给我收起来
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

143
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,008
你哪根筋没对
What the hell is wrong with you?

144
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,038
你怎么弄到的  从实验室偷出来的吗
Where did you get that? Did you take it from the lab?

145
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:50,069
从杀死康宝的那两个人手上买的
I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo.

146
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:54,036
他们让康宝曝尸街头
They had Combo shot down in the street,

147
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,003
现在又来卖我们的东西
and now it's our product they're selling.

148
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:02,053
说明他们为我们的人做事
Which means they work for our guy. Right?

149
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,013
什么东西  道听途说
What is that? That's hearsay.

150
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,047
你有证据吗
Do you have any proof?

151
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,042
我从开枪的那小孩的姐姐那里听来的
I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him.

152
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,024
听见我说"小孩"了吗
Hear how I just said "Kid"?

153
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:15,081
这小孩
This kid--

154
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,091
才11岁
he's 11 years old--

155
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:21,002
他们命令他杀死康宝
shot Combo on orders.

156
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:24,082
这两个卑鄙小人逼他贩毒
These two scumbags, they got him dealing.

157
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,082
他们逼他...
They got him--

158
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:28,076
你知道这不是头一回了
And you know he's not the first.

159
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,023
他们利用小孩  凭什么不利用
They use kids 'cause, hey, why not?

160
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,070
因为小孩容易控制  容易哄骗
Easy to control, easy to fool.

161
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,010
就算被抓也顶多算少年犯
All they get is juvie if they ever get caught.

162
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,080
笼络人心
Hearts and minds, right?

163
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:43,000
从小孩抓起  长大后他们就将永远听命于你
Get them young, and they're yours forever.

164
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,064
是他们杀了康宝
These guys killed Combo.

165
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:51,011
这小孩只是个傀儡
They used this little kid like some puppet.

166
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:55,062
他们利用他杀了我朋友
They used him to shoot my friend.

167
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:04,033
为什么要告诉我这些
So why are you telling me this?

168
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,020
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

169
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:13,030
怎么帮
How?

170
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,034
我需要蓖麻毒素
I need ricin.

171
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:15,090
上帝
Oh, my God.

172
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,024
天啊
Oh, God.

173
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,078
那两个  听着
These two-- Hey.

174
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:22,014
-不行  -听我说
- No. - Hey.

175
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:24,025
他们必须死
They got to go. All right?

176
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:26,025
-我计划都想好了  -不行
- I've got the entire thing figured out-- - No.

177
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,075
投毒的方式  一切尽在掌控中
...a delivery method, everything.

178
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,029
我只需要你帮我弄点毒药
All I need from you is the poison, that's all.

179
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:33,092
-不行  -听我说
- No-- - L-Look,

180
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,039
另外  你不必...
otherwise, you don't have to--

181
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,099
-不行  -你大可袖手旁观
- No-- - ... you don't have to lift a finger.

182
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:38,096
你根本不知道自己在说什么
Listen, you don't even know what you're talking about.

183
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:41,096
-这根本  -杀了他们简直是大快人心
- This is not even-- - Look, you don't get how right this is?

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,054
你不明白
Huh? You don't get how

185
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:46,063
整个世界没了他们会更加...
the whole entire world would be better off--

186
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,017
我们不要再谈论这事了
No, we're not even talking about this.

187
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,061
我认识个女的
I know a woman

188
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:52,021
每周从他们那里买一到两次货
who buys from the these two once or twice a week.

189
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:53,078
她给他们买汉堡
All right? She brings them hamburgers

190
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:56,011
因为他们成天在车子里会饿
'cause they sit in their car all day, and they get hungry,

191
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,038
她就带吃的过去
so she brings them food,

192
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,051
作为回报  他们就给她点优惠
and they knock a few bucks off her price.

193
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:02,038
我们就从这渠道下毒
There's your delivery system right there.

194
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,089
我可以在一英里外等着
I can be a mile away.

195
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:07,066
老天  干这事  你居然信一个瘾君子
Jesus. A meth-head you're trusting to do this?

196
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:10,099
你知道个屁  你连襟都搞不定她
You know what? That meth-head stood up to your brother-in-law.

197
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,029
他盘问了她5小时
All right? He questioned her for five hours.

198
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,020
她都没走露半点消息
She didn't give it up.

199
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,036
要证明吗
You know how it is you know it?

200
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,067
你现在没进监狱就是最好的证明
Because you're not in prison right now.

201
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,034
要是我这次答应了  我就该进监狱了
Yeah, well, I know I would be in prison after this.

202
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:24,081
或者更糟  搞不好把我们都搭进去
Prison or worse, and I'd be right alongside you.

203
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:27,074
所以不行  杰西  这简直是开国际玩笑
No-- Jesse, you cannot be serious.

204
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,091
这太荒唐了
Listen, this is a ridiculous idea.

205
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,025
荒唐吗
It's ridiculous?

206
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:35,045
你意思是不可行  是吗
What, so you're saying it's not going to work?

207
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,042
那当时你为什么用这办法
How about back when it was your plan?

208
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,088
为什么当时用这办法来对付屠库
Back when you were going to use it on Tuco?

209
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:42,039
两码事
Apples and oranges.

210
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,066
一旦中了蓖麻毒
Guy eats ricin.

211
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:45,069
两三天后  会得流感
Two or three days later, he gets the flu

212
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:48,013
或者心脏病发作之类  然后就死了
or a heart attack or something, and he keels over.

213
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,020
这可是你说的
That's what you said.

214
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,083
根本查不到我们
Untraceable back to us.

215
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,064
我是说根本查不到我
To-- To me.

216
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,057
连我们上头那混蛋
Not even that other scumbag we work for

217
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,017
也肯定弄不明白怎么回事
is ever going to figure it out.

218
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:01,011
当时用在屠库身上就是条妙计
Yo, it was a good plan back when it was Tuco,

219
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,068
现在同样也是
and it's a good plan now.

220
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,025
屠库当时想杀我们
Tuco wanted to murder us.

221
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,028
而他们没有
These guys don't.

222
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,095
两码事
Apples and oranges.

223
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,089
需要我坐在这里
Do I really have to sit here

224
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,016
跟你解释个中差异吗
and explain the difference to you?

225
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,049
康宝是我们的人
Combo was us, man.

226
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,066
我们的一份子
He was one of us.

227
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,003
难道他就白死了吗
Does that mean nothing?

228
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:26,047
那你为什么2-3月前不去找这些人算账
Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?

229
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,084
因为我才调查清楚
Because I just found out about them.

230
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,037
要调查清楚又不难
What's to find out?

231
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,037
这事儿就发生在他们地盘上  对不对
It's a dispute over turf, right?

232
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,084
要在他们的地盘上找出凶手
I mean, how hard could it have been

233
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:37,051
对你来说能有多难
for you to track them down on their turf

234
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:40,048
你几月前早就能报仇了
and kill them months ago?

235
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,072
为什么没有报成呢
Because back then

236
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,082
因为当时你正忙于嗨药
you were too busy getting high,

237
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,062
忙于自怨自艾
feeling sorry.

238
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:50,029
但杀人
Now, murder...

239
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:54,003
绝不属于你那"改过自新12步"的范畴
is not part of your 12-step program.

240
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:57,080
杀人可不是你必须做的补偿
This is not some amends that you have to make.

241
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:01,020
所以你所说的毫无意义
What you are talking about here is pointless.

242
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:05,014
达不到任何目的
This achieves nothing.

243
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:07,081
你将一无所获
It accomplishes nothing.

244
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:16,008
如果你不理解个中利害关系
If you don't see what it accomplishes,

245
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:18,019
那我也没什么好解释的了
then there's no way I can explain it to you.

246
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,026
杰西  听我说
Jesse, listen to me.

247
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,089
你绝不是个杀人犯
You are not a murderer.

248
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:28,070
我不是  你也不是
I'm not, and you're not.

249
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:32,027
就是这样简单的道理
It's as simple as that.

250
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:38,027
杰西
Jesse...

251
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:45,018
不管有你没你  我都要去
I'm doing it... with or without you.

252
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,088
摊牌
Knock, knock.

253
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,032
老天爷  玛丽  要摊牌你得这样
Christ sakes, Marie, you don't say "Knock, knock."

254
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:22,074
-是敲出来的  -我喜欢说出来
- Like that. - Well, I like saying it.

255
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:26,001
规则可不是这样的  懂吗
Yeah, well, that's not the rules. Okay?

256
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:28,008
你摊你的  我摊我的
Listen, you knock your way, Groucho. I'll knock mine.

257
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,018
总之  看  我赢了
But, look, see? I win.

258
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,062
你高兴的太早了
Not so fast.

259
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,052
老天爷  你又赢了  三连胜了
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,032
保罗·纽曼灵魂附体
Frickin' Paul Newman over here?

261
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,016
你是不是常和你爸爸玩牌
Have you been playing cards with your dad?

262
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,076
不是  怎么了
No, why?

263
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,063
你老爸怎么样了
How is your old man?

264
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:46,040
他回去教书了没
He back teaching?

265
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:49,063
没有  我爸妈现在好像都没在工...
No, I don't think either of them are working right--

266
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,090
工作
right now.

267
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:52,034
是吗  怎么会这样
Yeah? How they swinging that?

268
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:58,007
知道吗  医生说你汉克姨父
Did you know that the doctor has told your uncle Hank

269
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,081
随时都可以出院
that he can get out of here any time he wants to.

270
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,021
真的吗  那太好了
Oh, yeah? That's great.

271
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,041
是的  可我们没准备好出院
Yeah, well, we're not so sure about that.

272
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,095
为什么
Why not?

273
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,019
怎么了  医生就是这么说的
What? That's what they said.

274
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,015
医生这么说是因为他们要用病房
That's what they said because they want the room.

275
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,019
给床单消消毒
They hit the sheets with Lysol,

276
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,029
重置下仪器  就可以又推个傻逼入院了
re-set the meter, and wheel the next slob in here.

277
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,076
玛丽  这事我们讨论过了  你放弃吧
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

278
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,023
您身体还没恢复吗
Are you not well enough?

279
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:24,000
你也来烦我是吗
Jesus, kid, you, too?

280
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,054
你觉得我看上去好得很是吗
Do I look well enough?

281
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:28,057
我都快大小便失禁了
I'm shitting in pants, peeing in pitchers.

282
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:31,044
腿也动不了  懂了吗
Can't move my legs. Got it?

283
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,085
你是说坐轮椅的人都该住院吗
So people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals?

284
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:37,018
那拄拐杖的人呢
What about people on crutches?

285
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,015
看来我也应该住院才对
Maybe I should be in here, too.

286
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,069
您是这个意思吗
Is that what you're trying to say?

287
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:43,019
对  我就是这个意思
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

288
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:44,079
发牌  你个小混球
Deal, you little perk.

289
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,088
妈的
Bitch.

290
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,098
你知道我是按小时计费的吧
You know I'm hourly, right?

291
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,088
他答应过我他会来的
He promised me he'd be here.

292
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:16,055
噢  答应过  是吗  你早说啊
Oh, he promised, huh? Well, why didn't you tell me?

293
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,039
那我们慢慢等吧
Let's wait, then.

294
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,019
简直扯蛋  那小子不会来了
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

295
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:23,063
死心吧  你的二号方案是什么
Okay, so what's Plan B?

296
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,083
不知道
I don't know.

297
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,000
我真不知道
I really don't.

298
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,080
那就开动脑筋
Well, let's brainstorm.

299
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,023
你真的觉得他是来真的吗
You really think he's serious?

300
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:33,030
所以我才来这儿  索尔
That's why I'm here, Saul.

301
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:36,001
他和我说的时候那鼓劲  他真的会去做的
The way he was talking, he is going to do it.

302
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,011
或者至少会去试一试
Or try, at least.

303
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,031
好呀  那有什么  我们付给他钱呗
Okay, so, what, we pay him off.

304
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,098
不  不  不是钱的问题
No. No, it's not about money.

305
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,025
而是要想办法把他从街上拉回来
It's about getting him off the streets,

306
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,015
让他冷静下来
getting him to calm down.

307
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:48,045
要不然
Maybe--

308
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,099
如果我们...也许可以...
What if we... maybe--

309
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,066
你能不能找人把他抓起来
Could you get him arrested?

310
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,030
你
You--

311
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:06,087
你想把你的犯罪同伙送去警察局关起来
You want your criminal associate taken into police custody?

312
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,014
不是  听好
No, now, listen.

313
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,091
我知道这听起来很冒险
I know it sounds risky,

314
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,007
我说的那种"关起来"不是指
but it wouldn't be anything

315
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,034
那种真正的麻烦
that would get him into real trouble

316
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,044
而是那种不会牵涉到我们的"麻烦"
and nothing that could lead back to our business.

317
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:17,001
治他个轻罪
Just some minor offense.

318
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:19,042
平克曼蹲监狱  不靠谱吧
Pinkman in jail-- I don't know.

319
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,077
我在想象那情景  但
I'm picturing it and--

320
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:21,099
不  不是真进监狱
No, not in jail

321
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,092
而是"象征性"地进监狱
as in... "Jail" Jail.

322
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:29,003
我说的更像是那种
I'm talking about one of those situations

323
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:31,019
犯人穿着橘红色的囚衣
where you're in an orange jumpsuit

324
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,026
沿着高速公路捡垃圾
picking up litter along the highway.

325
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,080
这就是监狱
That's jail.

326
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,017
你说这个有点高端了
You're talking about a level-two joint.

327
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,034
只要能让他不上街找事  关个30天之类的
Something that keeps him off the street for, say, 30 days.

328
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,077
等他出来之后
Then by the time he gets out,

329
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,094
火气消了  大家就能和谐往前看了
tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on.

330
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:51,038
拉兹威调教中心就挺清闲
Well, Roswell Correctional's pretty low impact.

331
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,062
要在以前  我会推荐斯普林格
In the past I've recommended Springer,

332
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:57,022
不过自打他们翻新浴室之后
but hearing chancy things about their bathrooms

333
00:18:57,025 --> 00:19:01,036
接连发生偶发事件  所以...
since they renovated, so...

334
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,066
所以可以办到的  对吗
So it's possible, right?

335
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:07,099
可以  不过这属于套餐外的额外服务
Yeah, well, it falls under my premium-services package,

336
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,057
你得另付酬金
but you can afford that.

337
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,077
我会联络我的私家侦探
I'll call my P.I.

338
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,038
你知道该怎么做吗
You understand what you have to do?

339
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:25,002
绝不能有第二个人知道
You can never talk to anyone.

340
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,005
懂吗
Right?

341
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:31,049
是绝不能  懂吗
I mean, ever. Understand?

342
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,006
懂
Yeah.

343
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:39,096
这东西是我从网上找来的
I found this stuff on the Internet.

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,017
花了几天才弄到手
Takes days to kick in.

345
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,047
只要你不说出去
Just keep quiet,

346
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,050
这事儿就根本不会牵连到你
and this won't ever come back to you.

347
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,007
你干这个没问题的  对吧
You're okay with this, right?

348
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,015
就把它想成和你平常的工作一样
Just think of it like it's the same thing as always.

349
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,095
你不过是在递送汉堡
You're just delivering some hamburgers.

350
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,092
这可不是递送汉堡那么简单
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

351
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:07,049
嘿  你有个孩子
Hey, you got a kid.

352
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:08,089
对吧
Right?

353
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:10,093
他叫什么
What's his name?

354
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:12,043
帕特里克
Patrick.

355
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,033
想象一下如果这两个人
Imagine these two guys

356
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:17,060
把帕特里克当驴一样使
and Patrick working as a mule,

357
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:19,090
让他去杀人
making him kill people.

358
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,041
你难道不会站出来保护他吗
Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?

359
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:23,071
我当然会
Of course I would.

360
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:25,091
我愿意为他做任何事
I do all kinds of things for him.

361
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:31,055
好的  那么
Okay, so...

362
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:35,099
那些人这样利用孩子们
these guys using kids like that,

363
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,085
他们必须得死
they got to go.

364
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,099
对吧
Right?

365
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,020
很好
Good.

366
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,084
明天
Tomorrow.

367
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:58,078
咱们再联系
We'll be in touch.

368
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,066
这个一定很好吃  对吗
Bet that tastes good, huh?

369
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,017
来抱抱
Come here.

370
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,055
好样的  我们来觉觉
Okay, here we go.

371
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:38,078
睡觉觉啦
Here we go.

372
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,073
你来干什么
What are you doing?

373
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,076
如果你想谈  打电话
If you need to talk, use the phone.

374
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,000
电话上说不清楚  沃尔特
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

375
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:58,074
你老婆出去了  对吧
Your wife's out, right?

376
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,087
她真是个小乖乖
Isn't she something?

377
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:07,078
我有一个孙女比她大点儿
I got a granddaughter a few years older.

378
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,025
你有何贵干
What can I do for you?

379
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,008
沃尔特  咱坐下说
Have a seat, Walter.

380
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,071
我跟古德曼谈过平克曼的事
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman

381
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,076
还有你的计划
and this plan of yours.

382
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,036
然后呢
And?

383
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,010
我不打算去做
I'm not going to do it.

384
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,023
为什么
Why?

385
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,033
因为这么做太傻了
Because it's moronic.

386
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:33,094
索尔说你原来这么干过
Saul said you've done things like this before.

387
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,047
那部分不算傻
That's not the moronic part.

388
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,077
那么是什么问题
Okay, so what's the problem?

389
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:40,001
问题是老板可不会满意
The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.

390
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,011
索尔吗
Saul?

391
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,068
我的老板
My boss.

392
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:50,042
也是你的老板
Your boss.

393
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,089
我这次来  只是出于礼节
This is a professional courtesy.

394
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:58,070
没人知道我来过这儿  懂吗
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

395
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:02,027
但我们的老板会知道   一直是这样
But our employer would find out, like always,

396
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,097
而且如果平克曼被抓了
and if Pinkman were arrested,

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,030
他会把这事当成一个问题
he'd take it as a problem.

398
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:11,021
沃尔特  你现在的生活真的不错了
Walt, you got a good thing going here.

399
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,094
我们都是
We all do.

400
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:16,001
你想拿这一切去冒险救一个瘾君子吗
You want to risk it all on one junkie?

401
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,091
我知道你俩过去有交情
Now, I realize you two have a history,

402
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,058
但这小子现在已经很危险了
but this kid's been on the bubble a while now.

403
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:22,029
让我想起很久以前的事
It's a long time coming.

404
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,079
什么事
What is?

405
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,096
很久以前我曾是一名巡逻警察
I used to be a beat cop, long time ago,

406
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,077
我总被派去处理家庭纠纷
and I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time.

407
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,027
那些年  加一起差不多数百起吧
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

408
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,050
但有这么一个人
But there was this one guy,

409
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:44,064
那个混蛋我永远都不会忘
this one piece of shit that I will never forget.

410
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:47,024
他叫戈迪  长得有点像博·史文森[橄榄球明星]
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.

411
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,075
你记得那人吗
You remember him?

412
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:51,038
个子高高的  还记得吗
Walking Tall? You don't remember?

413
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,092
不记得算了  反正
No. Anyway...

414
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:57,002
大块头  270,280磅
big boy-- 270, 280,

415
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,042
他的妻子
but his wife--

416
00:23:58,046 --> 00:24:00,039
或无论她是谁
or whatever she was--

417
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:04,063
他的女人吧  简直是小鸟依人
his lady was real small, like a bird,

418
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,090
小手腕细得跟树枝一样
wrists like little branches.

419
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,080
然后呢
Hmm. Anyway,

420
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,030
我和搭档每周末都会被叫去调解
my partner and I get called out there every weekend,

421
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,037
我们总会把她拉到一边  对她说
and one of us would pull her aside and we'd say,

422
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,071
振作起来  今晚我们就要对他正式起诉
"Come on, tonight's the night we press charges."

423
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,017
这不是那种
And this wasn't one of those

424
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:20,098
"在心底里他是爱我的"的老情节
"Deep down he really loves me" Set-ups.

425
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,078
我们碰到过很多  但这案子不是
We got a lot of those, but not this.

426
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,055
这女孩是真的很害怕
This girl was scared.

427
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,095
她拿他根本没办法
She wasn't going to cross him no way, no how.

428
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,082
我们能做的只是把她送去急救而已
Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs,

429
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:32,062
把他叫上车  带到市区
put him in the car, drive him downtown,

430
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:34,036
把他扔到酒鬼拘押所
throw him in the drunk tank.

431
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,014
让他睡过去  到了第二天早上
He sleeps it off. Next morning,

432
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:38,083
照常回家
out he goes-- back home.

433
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,043
但有一晚
But one night

434
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,007
我搭档请了病假
my partner's out sick,

435
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,090
就我一个人
and it's just me.

436
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,010
电话又打来了
And the call comes in,

437
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,034
还是老戏码
and it's the usual crap--

438
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:52,038
说是"在浴室里摔倒弄破鼻子"之类的
broken-nose-in-the-shower kind of thing.

439
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,021
我就把他给拷上了  让他上车
So I cuff him, put him in the car,

440
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,038
把他带走了
and away we go.

441
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,022
只是那晚
Only that night...

442
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:01,065
我开车带他进市区
we're driving into town,

443
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:03,072
这混蛋
and this sideways asshole

444
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,095
坐在我的后座
is in my back seat

445
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:06,022
哼唱"男孩丹尼."
humming "Danny Boy."

446
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:11,089
我一下就火大了
And it just rubbed me wrong.

447
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,033
本来应该转左
So instead of left,

448
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,090
我却转右  把车开到了一个没人的地方
I go right, out into nowhere.

449
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,033
我让他跪下
And I kneel him down,

450
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:20,010
然后把枪塞到他嘴里
and I put my revolver in his mouth,

451
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,011
我告诉他
and I told him,

452
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:23,057
就是这样
"This is it.

453
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:26,034
你今天得死在这里
This is how it ends."

454
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,064
他吓哭了
And he's crying,

455
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,085
屎尿全都吓出来了
going to the bathroom all over himself,

456
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,032
对天发誓他再也不碰那女孩了
swearing to God he's going to leave her alone,

457
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,072
尖叫着
screaming...

458
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,055
因为枪还塞在他嘴里
as much as you can with a gun in your mouth.

459
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,066
我叫他安静
And I told him to be quiet...

460
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:43,049
因为我要好好想想接下来该怎么做
'cause I need to think about what I was gong to do here.

461
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:46,016
他当然安静下来了
And of course he got quiet.

462
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,060
就这样一直安静
Goes still.

463
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:50,043
真的很安静
And real quiet.

464
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:54,030
像条等剩饭的狗
Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.

465
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,091
然后我们原地站了一会儿
Then we just stood there for a while.

466
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,058
我假装在考虑
Me acting like I'm thinking things over,

467
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,085
帅哥跪在泥里
and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt

468
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:06,038
屁滚尿流
with shit in his pants.

469
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,002
几分钟之后
And after a few minutes

470
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:14,006
我把枪从他嘴里拔了出来
I took the gun out of his mouth,

471
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,083
对他说  "我发誓  你要是再敢碰她"
and I say, "So help me, if you ever touch her again,

472
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:21,010
"我就如此怎样怎样"
"I will such and such and such and such

473
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,063
"之类的那些话"
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

474
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:30,004
只是警告一下他吗
Just a warning?

475
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,034
当然
Of course.

476
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:38,088
只是想要做件好事
Just trying to do the right thing.

477
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:45,042
可是两周之后  他杀了她
But two weeks later he killed her.

478
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:46,099
当然
Of course.

479
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:53,023
用搅拌机砸瘪了她的头
Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender.

480
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,053
我们赶到的时候  到处都是血
We got there, there was so much blood,

481
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,033
空气里弥漫着铁锈的味道
you could taste the metal.

482
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:04,094
这个故事告诉我们一个道理
The moral of the story is...

483
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,088
我在本该决断的时候
I chose a half measure

484
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:11,088
采取了姑息折衷
when I should have gone all the way.

485
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:19,046
我绝不会再犯同样的错误
I'll never make that mistake again.

486
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,053
别再姑息折衷  沃尔特
No more half measures, Walter.

487
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,033
这是怎么回事
Man, I don't get this.

488
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,030
我搞不明白
I don't get this at all.

489
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:56,041
只看到那孩子
All I'm seeing is the kid.

490
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:59,061
他们到哪儿去了
So where are they?

491
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,031
我不知道
I don't know.

492
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,015
他们应该在附近的
They're always around.

493
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,082
汉堡都快凉了
Burgers are getting cold.

494
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:11,072
这东西  会很快吗
So is it, like, fast?

495
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,083
别慌  好吗  你只要一切如常就好
Don't sweat it, all right? You're just doing what you do.

496
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,050
没有人会知道
Nobody's going to know anything.

497
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:23,010
我能再喝一杯吗
Can I have another bump?

498
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,097
你已经喝过一杯了
You had your bump.

499
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,044
事成之后  你要什么都可以
We get this thing done. Then you can have all you want.

500
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:30,041
你得跟我走一趟
Going to need you to come with me.

501
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,054
你可以走了
Take a walk.

502
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,068
我们这是去哪儿
Where are we going?

503
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,098
坐下
Sit down.

504
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:02,006
我了解到你跟我的两名雇员之间有些矛盾
I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees.

505
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:07,013
他们确实杀死了你的一位合伙人
It is true that they killed one of your associates.

506
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:10,027
他们的行为可能有些鲁莽
It is possible they acted rashly,

507
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,030
但另一方面  他们也确实受到了挑衅
but, on the other hand, there was provocation.

508
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:15,067
有人在他们地盘上贩毒
A man was selling on their territory.

509
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:20,048
双方都有责任
There is blame on both sides.

510
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:27,035
此事到此为止
This will go no further.

511
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,099
就在此地  此刻解决
It will be settled right here, right now.

512
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,059
你告诉他了
You told him.

513
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,083
出去等
Wait outside.

514
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:52,081
你听好了
Listen to me.

515
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,064
这间屋子里  你只有一个朋友
You have one friend in this room.

516
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,015
就是这个人
This man.

517
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,092
外面那两个人
Those men outside

518
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:02,069
是我信任的雇员
are my trusted employees,

519
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:06,009
所以当我得知你打算...
and when I learned what you intended to do...

520
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,049
如果不是因为这个人
If it wasn't for this man

521
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,063
以及我对他的尊重
and the respect I have for him,

522
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:16,027
我会以完全不同的方式来处理你
I would be dealing with this in a very different way.

523
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,074
别看他  看着我
You don't look at him. You look at me.

524
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,044
接下来你该这样做
This is what happens now.

525
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,061
我的人进来以后
My men will come back inside,

526
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:32,042
你跟他们握手
and you will shake their hands

527
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:34,018
同他们和好
and you will make peace.

528
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:36,089
然后此事到此为止
And that will be the end of this.

529
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,089
不
No.

530
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,039
杰西
Jesse...

531
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,023
你说什么
Pardon me?

532
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,007
他们利用孩子
They use kids.

533
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,053
你手下这帮混蛋
These assholes of yours,

534
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,027
他们派一个11岁的孩子去帮他们杀人
they got an 11-year-old kid doing their killing for them.

535
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,044
我以为你是个通情达理的生意人
You're supposed to be some kind of reasonable businessman.

536
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:58,004
你就这样做生意的吗
This how you do business?

537
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,044
你不反对他们这样吗
You okay with this?

538
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:03,035
你不想说点什么吗
You got anything to say here?

539
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:20,030
叫他们进来
Bring them back.

540
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,022
不许再利用孩子
No more children.

541
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,026
懂了吗
Understand?

542
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,026
还有你
And you.

543
00:33:58,027 --> 00:33:59,087
不许再闹了
You keep the peace.

544
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:06,024
说出来
Say it.

545
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:10,061
是  我不会再闹了
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

546
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,059
握手
Shake hands.

547
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:02,063
杰西  你的行为
Jesse, your actions...

548
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,067
会影响到其他人
they affect other people.

549
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:12,004
有些时候
And sometimes

550
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:14,014
必须学会妥协
compromises have to be made...

551
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:19,005
理智一点
for the best of reasons.

552
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,030
别走  杰西  杰西
No, Jesse. Jesse!

553
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:57,092
玛丽  让那些拿了工钱的来干这活
Marie, let the people who get paid to do this, do this.

554
00:35:57,095 --> 00:36:01,002
他们哪有我干的这么上心
The people who get paid to do this, do a lousy job.

555
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,084
这就是你想要的  对吧
So I guess this is what you want, huh?

556
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:18,087
躺在医院病床上
Just lying in a hospital bed,

557
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:21,024
让护士用海绵擦身
getting sponge baths from nurses.

558
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:22,085
玛丽
Marie.

559
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,095
该回家了  汉克
It's time to go home, Hank.

560
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:28,045
玛丽  还要我说多少次
How many times I got to tell you, Marie?

561
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:30,059
没痊愈我就不出院
Not till I'm well.

562
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:40,016
嘿  你干什么呢
Hey, what are you doing?

563
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,063
只是看看
I'm just seeing.

564
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,000
看什么
Seeing what?

565
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:44,080
你觉得我在看什么
Seeing what I see.

566
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,057
我现在状态不好  玛丽
I'm not at my best here, Marie.

567
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:51,017
我们走着瞧
We'll see.

568
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:53,038
不会有变化的
Nothing's going to happen.

569
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,051
我认为会的
I say it will.

570
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,091
我住院是有原因的
I'm in this bed for a reason.

571
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:01,042
你这是浪费时间
Well, it's a waste of time.

572
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:06,069
再说了  要是有人进来怎么办
Besides, what if someone comes in?

573
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,019
随便  我不介意有人进来
Let them. I don't care if someone walks in.

574
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:10,003
玛丽  你有毛病吗
Marie, what's wrong with you?

575
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:12,083
这样好了
I'll tell you what.

576
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:15,044
如果我能让你"重振雄风"的话...
If I can get the groundhog to see his shadow...

577
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,038
不可能的  抱歉
It's not going to happen. I'm sorry.

578
00:37:16,038 --> 00:37:19,034
我打赌它会  如果我赢了
I'm betting it will, and if he does,

579
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,080
你就出院
you check out of here.

580
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:26,008
我才不和你赌这个
I'm not going to bet on whether I get a boner.

581
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,018
不赌  坚决不赌
It's not bet. There's no bet here. No bet.

582
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,038
你怕输吗
You afraid you'll lose?

583
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,055
你知道吗  这真是
You know what? You're just--

584
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,038
你又在犯傻了
You're just being foolish, you know?

585
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,008
拜托
Come on.

586
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:36,069
有意义吗
What's the point?

587
00:37:36,072 --> 00:37:37,089
意义就是
The point is...

588
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:40,022
可以证明你并不是全无希望
you're not completely hopeless.

589
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,026
愿意赌了吗
We have a bet?

590
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,060
既然这样
You know what?

591
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:51,017
如果这能让你死心的话
If it'll get you out of here quicker,

592
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,023
给你一分钟
you got one minute.

593
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,024
一分钟吗
One minute?

594
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,097
好  那太简单了
All right. That's a cakewalk.

595
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,011
这真是
Yeah, this is just--

596
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:59,034
真是太悲哀了
It's just sad. I mean--

597
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,034
我真是同情你  你知道吗  玛丽
I really feel sorry for you, Marie, you know?

598
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:03,058
真的  这真是
I really do. It's just-- It's--

599
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,058
太可悲了
...pathetic.

600
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,022
没关系  随便你怎么说
That's okay. Keep talking.

601
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:08,085
抗议吧
Protest.

602
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,002
挣扎吧
Struggle.

603
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,082
玛丽  放弃吧
Marie, give up.

604
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:15,052
我是说真的  这
I mean, seriously, it's...

605
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,086
是
not...

606
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,088
不可能的事
going to happen.

607
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:46,012
今天过得很糟吗
Bad day?

608
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:50,073
我也不知道
I don't even know.

609
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:58,007
不过  现在好多了
Anyway, it's better now.

610
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:08,008
告诉他们你在忙
Tell them you're busy.

611
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:13,005
喂
Hello.

612
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,018
奶奶
Grandma?

613
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,005
慢点说
Slow down.

614
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:18,092
慢点  我听不清
Slow down. I can't--

615
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:23,066
什么
Oh, God.

616
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,083
天啊
Oh, God.

617
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:31,047
我的天啊
