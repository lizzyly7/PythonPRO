在当地黑帮  有个鬼佬正声名鹊起

4
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:36,073
都是因为他所制的毒品

00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:50,028

00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:28,025
只是没人能一睹真容  所以没人认识他

11
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:32,049
贩毒集团绝不会善罢甘休

00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,052
氮和氧通过化学键结合
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,

37
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,011
就会转化为
Which, in turn...

38
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,048
你知道什么是化学键吧
You do know what a bond is?

39
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:59,067
一种强烈的吸引力
A strong force of attraction.

40
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,084
比如共价键  离子键
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

41
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:07,078
原子和分子相互结合组成化合物
The coming together of atoms and molecules to form compounds?

42
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,002
正是化学键
Chemical bonds

43
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,058
让物质成为了物质
Are what make matter matter.

44
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:20,050
正是化学键  把物质世界联系起来
Bonds are what hold the physical world together,

45
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,075
把我们联系起来
What hold us together.

你的考试成绩可不这么说
Your test score says otherwise.

50
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:31,007
正说明你啥都没搞懂
It tells me you don't get it at all.

00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,034
58分  差不多了
I mean, 58. I was close.

什么叫差不多了
What is close?

53
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,043
科学领域可没有"差不多"一说  巴里
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

54
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,091
只有正确错误之分
There are right answers and wrong answers.

55
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,064
"差不多"可不能让人类登上月球
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

56
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,090
是, 但是
Yeah, but...

我可能得了注意力缺陷症
The attention deficit.

65
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:21,021
你就不能放我一马吗
Couldn't you please just let this slide?

66
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:33,020
别痴人说梦了
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,062
不行  下次自己发愤图强吧
The answer is no.Next time, apply yourself.

68
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:26,045
认识我的  就留个口信吧
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

69
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,056
你是在躲着我还是怎么着
Are you ducking me or what?

70
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,041

我跟你说"处理掉"
When I said "handle it"?

不用麻烦了
Well, don't.

你和你儿子之间的事  是你们的家务事

至少你还有个电话
I see you have a telephone at least.

119
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,090
知道我一直打给你是什么事吧
You know, that blinking thing I've been calling you on?

120

122
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,098
TM就会吸毒的笨蛋
Damn druggy idiot.

123
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,087
我找了你那么久
Is this what you've been doing the whole time

124
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,059
你就一直这么窝着吸这个吗
 I've been trying to reach you?

125
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,051
当然不是
No.

126
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,040
我出去处理事情了
I've been taking care of business.

127
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,093
-什么事情  -你问我什么事情
- What business? - What business?

128
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:53,050
你逼着我做的事情  混蛋

你忘了吗
You already forgot?

130
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,097
就是这个事情
This business.

131
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,077
这个有没有让你想起点什么
Does that jog your memory?

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,051
你个王八蛋
Son of a bitch.

133
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,064
-你不会真的  -你说了  "处理掉"
- You didn't actually... - You said "handle it."

134
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,009
所以我把他解决了
So I handled it.

135
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,044
我说"处理掉"的意思  是让你恐吓威胁他
When I said "handle it,"I meant fear and intimidation.

136
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,073
是让你把钱拿回来
Get your money back.

137
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,083
-我从来没有让你  -没有让我去杀人的意思吗
- I certainly never meant for you...- You didn't mean to kill somebody?

138
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:27,045
没有
No

139
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:31,017
太晚了  因为那家伙已经挂了
Too late, yo, because dude's dead.

140
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,001
我的天

你的那一半

145
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:50,031
留着小命好好花吧  你这个该死的混蛋
Spend it in good health,you miserable son of a bitch.

146
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,071
我可没说是我杀了他
I didn't say I killed him.

147
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,058
告诉我怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

148
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:31,012
那家伙的老婆用台自动取款机
The dude's wife crushed his head

149
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,043
砸烂了他的脑袋
with an ATM machine.

150
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:37,034
-砸烂了他的  -用台自动取款机砸烂了他的脑袋
- Crushed his...- Crushed his head with an ATM machine.

151
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,087
就在我的面前
Right in front of me.

152
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,071
我是说  就像在砸
I mean, crushed it like...

153
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,089
我的老天  那个声音
Oh, my God, the sound...

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,071
那声音怎么都忘不了
It's still in my ears.

155
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:51,003
还有那血  喷得到处都是
You know, and the blood,like, everywhere.

156
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:55,011
怎么会有那么多血  简直无法置信
Like, there was so much,you would not believe.

157
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,057
老兄  你就行行好给我吧
Man, will you just please give me...

158

309
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:16,099
-帮我转达下问候  -我一定转达
- You tell him I said hello. - I will definitely do that.

310
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:23,040
老实说  泰德
To be honest, Ted,

311
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,024
我这次来  不只是来问个好的
I didn't just stop by to say hello.

312
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:31,044
我是来申请份数据录入工作的
I was applying for the data entry job.

313
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:34,040
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

314
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:37,076
你可一直是我们最棒的记账员
You were like our go-to book keeper.

315
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,070
经济形势  你也知道的  所以...
The economy, you know, so...

316
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:46,022
数据录入  那怎么可以
Well, data entry,that'd be a mistake.

317
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:54,094
做回你的老本行  怎么样
How about...get your old job back?

318
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:58,088
公司发展得很快
We're expanding and...

319
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:03,053
咱私下说说啊  整个部门简直就一团乱
Between you and me, that whole department is pretty much of a mess.

320
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,080
这工作你完全可以胜任
Your work would be cut out for you. But...

321
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,022
而且我们需要你帮忙
We could use your help.

322
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,022
好的
Ok

323
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:22,098
现在这些是我们地盘  对吗  目前来说 
Now, this is our territory, right? Currently.

324
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:24,072
你在听吗
Hello?

325
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,013
-对的  -然后  看看这里
- Correct. - All right, then. Now, look at this.

326
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,036
这里这里这里  还有这里
Here, here, here and here.

327
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,018
这些对你来说意味着什么
What does that look like to you?

328
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:37,054
机会  赚大钱的机会  就是这个
Opportunities. Golden ones.That's what that looks like.

329
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:41,025
看看这里  整个城市商机无限啊
Look.It's an entire city full of buyers.

330
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,001
那么  为什么我们还没扩展到那里
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

331
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:46,081
-因为那不是我们的地盘  -因为我们缺乏进取心
- Because it's not our territory.- Because we lack initiative.

332
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:50,044
-进取心  -你得雇用更多的毒贩
- Initiative? - You need to employ more dealers.

333
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,007
增加两倍  三倍的人手
Double, triple your crew.

334
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:54,091
我见到的那三个人  每人都应该找三个  六个
Those three I met...they should each have three, six,

335
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:57,031
九个下家  为他们工作
Nine sub-dealers working for them.

336
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,064
指数级的增长  那才是关键
Exponential growth...that's the key.

337
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,064
那不是我们的地盘
It's not our territory.

338
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:04,060
你听得懂吗  老兄
Man, you follow me, here?

339
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:08,003
我们要是介入到别人的地盘
We go rolling into these neighborhoods,

340
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,018
那些家伙不会放过我们的
Other crews ain't going to take kindly.

341
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:13,086
-你明白吗  -当然  他们会不高兴
- You understand? - Sure. They won't like it.

342
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:16,079
但我敢说他们不会把我们怎么样的
But I say they're not going to do a thing about it.

343
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,083
听着  杰西  不
Listen, Jesse.-No.

344
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,062
杰西
 Jesse.

345
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,072
局势已经变了  消息已经传开了  
The game has changed.The word is out.

346
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:27,062
说你是个惹不得的人
And you are a killer.

347
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,054
-你在说什么呢  -显然这点已经人尽皆知了
- What are you talking about?- Apparently it's all over town.

348
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,002
有人惹了你  你大发雷霆
Somebody crossed you. You got angry.

349
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,009
用台自动取款机砸碎了他的脑袋
You crushed their skull with an ATM machine.

350
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,081
-但这根本不是事实  -谁在乎呢
- But that's not how it happened. - Who cares?

351
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:44,051
只要我们的竞争对手  而不是警察  相信这点
Just as long as it's our competitors who believe it and not the police.

352
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:47,038
-我的天  -你没看出来这事有多棒吗
- My God.- Don't you see how great this is?

353
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:51,002
你看  你就是一个...
Look, you are a...

354
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,066
杰西  看着我
Jesse, look at me.

355
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,079
你  就是条河豚
You... are a blowfish.

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,029
-什么  -河豚  想想看
- What? - A blowfish. Think about it.

357
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:06,083
体型不大  动作不快  也不灵活
Small in stature,not swift, not cunning.

358
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:10,065
很容易成为盘中餐  但是河豚
Easy prey for predators.But the blowfish

359
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,049
有一项秘密武器  对吗
Has a secret weapon, doesn't he?

360
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,042
河豚会怎么做  杰西
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?

361
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,017
河豚会怎么做
What does the blowfish do?

362
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,006
-我不知道  -河豚会膨胀
- I don't know... - The blowfish puffs up.

363
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:27,060
河豚能自我膨胀到平常的四到五倍大
The blowfish puffs himself up four or five times larger than normal.

364
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:29,036
为什么  它为什么会这么做呢
And why? Why does he do that?

365
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:32,074
这样能让它具有威慑力  这就是原因
So that it makes him intimidating,that's why.

366
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:33,097
威慑力
Intimidating,

367
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:37,035
这样才能把其他更可怕的鱼都吓跑
So that the other scarier fish are scared off.

368
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,088
而这就你是  你就是那条河豚
And that's you.You are a blowfish.

369
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:43,003
知道了吗  所有这些都是种错觉
You see? It's just all an illusion.

370
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:45,084
明白了吗  这就是个烟雾弹
See? It's nothing but air.

371
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:49,007
现在
Now,

372
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:52,063
谁还敢跟河豚对着干呀  杰西
Who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?

373
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,004
-没人敢  -你说得真TM对
- Nobody.- You're damn right.

374
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,088
-我是河豚  -你是河豚
- I'm a blowfish.- You are a blowfish.

375
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,001
-再说一遍  -我是河豚
- Say it again.- I'm a blowfish.

376
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,088
-郑重其事地说一遍  -我就是河豚
- Say it like you mean it.- I'm a blowfish!

377
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,001
就是这样
That's it.

378
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:10,008
河豚要来一下这个
Blowfishing this up.

379
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,087
商品型录  把那本型录给我  好吗

Vanco, new guy don't speak Spanish?

381
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:03,043
怎么了
What's up?

00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:06,043
白佬
Hey, white boy,

383
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,082
最好学着点西班牙语  懂吗
Better learn espanol, huh?

00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,032
这里可不是美国的密苏里州布兰森  懂我意思吗
This ain't Branson, Missouri.You know what I'm talking about?

385
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,027
我看这样吧

我来教你
I'll teach you.

387
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,066
意思就是
It means

388
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:22,087
"我们来做个交易吧"
"Let's make a deal."

389
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:25,037

"玳瑁"意思就是"乌龟"
"Tortuga" means "turtle."

00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:43,075

再说他也忙得根本没时间
They keep him busy every second.

431
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,094
他们马上就有个大行动  
He's already got some big operation going, some kind

432
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,074
好像是啥秘密行动吧  他什么都不说
Of hush-hush deal. He couldn't tell me a thing about it except

433
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:36,009
-就说是个境外行动  -听起来热血沸腾啊
- It's on the other side of the border.- That sounds exciting.

434
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,056
他在那很安全的  对吗
He's being safe, right?

435
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:42,000
他老说一直就做些办公室工作

436

咱私下说说啊  我还巴不得这样呢

说到办公室工作
Speaking of riding desks...

438
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,010
今天我找了份工作
I got myself a job today.

439
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,094
你不是吧
You did not.

440
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:57,084
挺着这么个大肚子
As big as you are?

441
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,088
多谢关心
Thank you.

442
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:03,048
我只是想说
You know I just mean...

443
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,008
在哪儿  跟谁呀
Where? With who?

444
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:09,017
合着还有人愿意跟个大肚子共事啊
Well, someone willing to work around that, apparently.

445
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:13,008
-是贝内克的公司  -你不是吧
- Beneke. - You did not.

446
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:15,045
对你毛手毛脚的那位还在那吗

448
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,004
而且他当时已经醉到话都讲不清了
And he was so drunk he was practically slurring his words.

449
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:24,019
是你自己在给他找借口吧
Just what you want in an executive.

450
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,091
而且他也反复道过歉了
And he apologized profusely.

451
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:27,084
再说他是有家室的人了
Plus, he's married, has a family.

452
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,064
肯定也不愿被冠个性骚扰的罪名吧

00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,027
到这儿就行不通了
